Airline Name,Title,Airline Review Rating,Airline Review
British Airways,A new low for a FLIGHT service.,1,"Went from Tahiti to Los Angeles, then made another flight to Chicago. That's when I recently flew with British Airways to get to Heathrow... I was extremely disappointed with the service. My flight was delayed for several hours without any clear communication from the staff, leaving passengers frustrated and anxious. When I finally arrived at my final destination, my luggage was missing, and attempts to contact customer service were futile. The automated systems provided no real assistance, and I felt completely abandoned. Overall, this experience has made me hesitant to fly with British Airways again."
British Airways,Bumped off a flight in Ibiza,1,"Bumped off a flight in Ibiza. Notification came whilst en route Malaga to Ibiza for the flight with which we were connecting. Made a claim under EU 261. Should not have been off loaded as under EU regulations a passenger with mobility issues, which my wife has, should not be off loaded. Iberia sorted out the overnight accommodation. EU 261 claim made mid September. Not settled yet so I have passed to Dispute Resolution service."
British Airways,I was on a flight from Singapore to…,2,I was on a flight from Singapore to London. I was very unimpressed by the food and the amount of leg room. I couldn't even get to the toilet without nearly crushing another passenger. Absolutely unacceptable how many people they are trying to fit on their planes now! The food was absolutely vile too. I will eat near enough anything but this was simply inedible. The only saving grace was their staff. They were simply wonderful. They were so helpful and kind. Wouldn't recommend them for a long haul flight at all!
British Airways,Make BA your second choice,1,"My experience with British Airways was deeply disappointing. Every single flight I took with them was delayed, which I was willing to overlook until one delay lasted an entire day. They completely mishandled my accommodation, leaving me stranded on the other side of the world in a dangerous country. To make matters worse, they took zero accountability for their failures after my trip concluded. I expected far better. Would not recommend."
British Airways,"What is happening to British Airways, our national carrier?",1,"So many negative reviews!! And from me the comment that the website is broken!! Error messages, no ways of accessing the relevant pages! Telephone access takes hours. And does anyone within the company care? My loyalty to British Airways which has been solid for years, is now also breaking ....."
British Airways,Water leak in business class,1,"Water leak in business class
My suit was wet with dirty water
Compensation of 50 pound voucher for British airlines provided for such a horrible experience in business class"
British Airways,Does British airways even know what service means?,1,"We have booked our trip with British Airways and one of our group members wasn’t able to join. Tickets were fully paid but during the journeys this seat was given to other people. Cabin personnel informed us to inform customer service of BA. They agreed and promised to pay us back. After sending reminders to British airways over and over they say now after 2,5 years later they cannot find any information anymore??? Never have seen such a bad airline in my life. Will never go with them on a trip"
British Airways,If I could give it 0 stars I would,1,If I could give it 0 stars I would. Hope you don’t have to cancel your flight because you won’t get refunded. Your money goes to British Airways regardless. Speaking to a supervisor is like pulling teeth and from the other reviews I take it they don’t want to deal with all of the complaints. So many people have mentioned taking them to court so no wonder they keep your money. They have to pay attorney fees somehow. Oh and if it’s a medical emergency they want your medical information so they are clueless of what HIPPA violations mean. Overall ridiculous service and I haven’t even stepped foot on the plane yet. I can only imagine what that experience will consist of.
British Airways,Awful company,1,"Awful company, money grabbers, zero customer service. I have booked 3 tickets for my family . 2 children and one adult but wrongly put my name to the adult ticket instead of my husband who will travel with the kids.
Tried to correct my mistake and change my first name to my husbands but was told it is not possible, even if you want to pay for it. Instead, they have advised to cancel all my tickets and book a new ticket for our two children and my husband loosing all the money I have paid for at the first booking."
British Airways,Awful service for complaints!,1,"Awful service for complaints! I raised a complaint on the 14th November 2024 and am still waiting for the case to even be picked up by someone. Considering the disability discrimination raised by my case, you would have liked to think it would have some importance (any complaint should be treated with importance). Clearly British Airways do not care."
British Airways,I am trying to claim avios on recent…,1,I am trying to claim avios on recent flights but the system is erroneously rejecting them. Of course there is no number to call to rectify the problem...
British Airways,From start to finish - A Terrible Experience,1,"From start to finish, this was an utterly terrible experience, and sadly, it’s not the first time I’ve encountered such poor service from BA.

Key issues:
1. Outdated airplanes – The aircraft felt ancient, with less legroom and space than budget airlines like Ryanair or easyJet. Yet, BA charges more than double the price, which is simply unjustifiable.
2. Poorly trained staff – The crew seemed uninterested, unprofessional, and entirely unprepared to provide even basic customer service. This is not what you’d expect from a so-called premium airline.
3. Minimal refreshments – Refreshments were practically non-existent. For the inflated price of a BA ticket, you’d think they could at least offer passengers a drink and a snack without cutting corners.

What’s worse is that this isn’t an isolated incident—this level of service has become the norm with British Airways. I have regularly encountered the same issues, which suggests the airline has no interest in improving.

As the UK’s national airline, BA is a complete embarrassment. I’d honestly choose to fly with any other airline over them in the future."
British Airways,Awful,1,"Awful!

I cannot believe how the quality has gone from 5 star to literally 1 star. The food was atrocious, and the crew were unfriendly and loud. Having been an avid BA member I dont think I will fly BA again."
British Airways,Thieving airline,1,"Had return flights booked to US via Dublin in July 2024. The outbound leg was cancelled and I was promised a refund.

Six months on, eight phone calls to BA's call centre later and still no refund received. Every call is the same, explain the situation, get a promise the refund will be made in 7-10 days, no refund received. Rinse and repeat....

I consider this money stolen from me and now taking them to small claims court. I will never fly with them again. AVOID!"
British Airways,Flights cancelled took 5 days and 1hr a…,1,"Flights cancelled took 5 days and 1hr a day to sort, cost us a fortune to change hotel dates and taxi to our original destination
BA not interested one girl told us to cancel our holiday and lose everything
Disgraceful way to treat customers"
British Airways,Terrible Service and Lack of Accountability,1,"My experience with British Airways has been nothing short of appalling. After my flight (BA423) was cancelled due to weather, I received minimal support and no empathy from their staff. Despite rebooking to an earlier flight at my own expense (€170), I ended up arriving 6.5 hours later, losing an entire day of plans with my daughter.

British Airways failed to provide proper care or offer a suitable alternative flight, as required by EU Regulation 261/2004. To make matters worse, their responses were dismissive, and the €200 they reimbursed doesn’t begin to cover the disruption, costs, and stress we endured.

I’ve now escalated this to the ILT and am pursuing legal action. This airline does not respect its customers' time or rights. Avoid them at all costs"
British Airways,MISHANDLING OF BAGGAGE IN BRITISH AIRWAYS AND NO COMPENSATION FOR CLAIM,1,"""Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm sharing my frustrating experience with British Airways' customer service. My friend's baggage was delayed on a recent flight, causing significant inconvenience and distress.

Despite submitting a claim, BA responded with a generic apology and refused to provide fair compensation. Their reasoning? They're only liable for 'basic essential items' purchased during the delay. No consideration for the emotional distress, wasted time, or overall poor experience.

Flight was from [MCO] to [Amman], baggage was delayed for [5] days. Claim was submitted with all required documents, but BA provided compensation of only $70, which wasnot accepted by my friend..""

One of the worst airlines across the list."
British Airways,Worst long haul flight ever I thought…,1,Worst long haul flight ever I thought British airways would be quality. What a joke. Uncomfortable and terrible service. It was like sitting on a Ryanair flight for 12hrs. Infact that’s an insult to Ryanair.
British Airways,2 hours to reschedule a flight - without success!,1,"I just spent 2 hours trying to find the right contact number to be able to reschedule an Avios reward flight.

With any other airline a very simple task, but a nightmare with British Airways. Three failed attempts as I have been referred to different hotlines. I have given up - British Airways customer service is a mess!"
British Airways,We had such a great experience with BA…,5,"We had such a great experience with BA on our last trip. We have the executive club card and had to move our flight twice, once due to illness and then due to the LA wildfires. The team were so kind and helpful. It was really a refreshing experience given usual call centre experiences. Thanks to the two lovely individuals we spoke to!"
British Airways,Like many people said,1,"Like many people said, arrogant and extremely rude staff. Not only are they unhelpful and disorganized, but they've reduced their service so much, that they'll leave you stranded anywhere you go. I've taken so many flights with different airlines, and by far this is the worst airline I've ever taken in my life. I'll be giving all your competitors my money, and you won't get a dime out of me."
British Airways,Want to Fly to Taiwan - not China!,1,"I'm searching for flights to Taipei which is in Taiwan but British Airways refers to a whole other country - China.

Not sure who's in charge of this blunder.

However, I'll be booking my flights with China Airlines or EVA air. With BA I'm not sure I'll get to the correct destination or even country! Pity."
British Airways,Just wanted to say how good the cabin…,5,"Just wanted to say how good the cabin crew excellent service from molly on the top deck also julie form the 5th January flight from San Francisco to London Heathrow was fab experience.
And a shout out to the pilots did a grand Job when you have a grand experience people don't say it 😀 very good team on that flight thank you more to come 😀"
British Airways,Access to BA customer service,1,"I have been trying to obtain a receipt for BA flights taken in Nov/Dec 24 and am getting nowhere. I have raised 2 x cases with BA, the first sat with BA for 3 weeks before being closed without resolution and the second has sat at 'received' for over a week with no progress. Having waited for live chats with a real person the live chats 'mysteriously' have been disconnected forcing me to start all over again.
My request for a receipt is pretty simple, if BA cannot get this right I dread to think how the rest of the business is being run.
I was once a fan of BA but current performance is making it NOT the world's favourite airline!"
British Airways,Such arrogant staff and poor service all in all,1,"LON -SFO
SFO-LON
Such arrogant and poor service from a career never seen before. Some of the Senior staff are obnoxious and make unwanted comments. Looks like there is no monitoring of their services or behaviour. Food was poor and inadequate, and so were the facilities and entertainment for a long-haul flight. Budget airlines would do a better job. At the end of the journey, we wanted to find something positive to write. But there wasn't anything."
British Airways,Our flight was very late Manchester to…,1,"Our flight was very late Manchester to Heathrow and we missed the next 2 connections to Bangkok. We got there eventually 17 hours later than we should have with extra costs of £408.
We were exhausted with no sleep, no offers of help and staff rerouting passengers with no empathy, it was awful. They refused to refund my extra costs. Worst airline we have been on and we fly a lot. Choose any airline but British Airways."
British Airways,No loyalty,1,"I've been a loyal Avios customer for years + have a BA Amex card.

I've put BA on my blacklist for the following reason:

1. I had earned a companion voucher through my spend. I tried to book a flight with this voucher but there was a problem with their Executive Club portal. The voucher subsequently expired & when I asked that they allow me to use it, they refused on 2 different occasions.

2. Their Avios scheme doesn't adequately reward loyalty - you lose tiers if you don't fly with BA for a period of time.

In view of my spend, I am sorely disappointed with the lack of loyalty I've received back from BA particularly when their IT system prohibited me from using the companion voucher I had earned through my spend.

It is for that reason, BA is on my blacklist and I will not fly with them for the foreseeable."
British Airways,Greedy,1,"Do not book or combine flights with other airlines through them. None of the airlines will help you! Other airlines have waived fees due to the LA fire, but British Airways doesn’t care. There’s no electricity and/or water in the area, but they still want you to fly there or pay $1K for changing the flight."
British Airways,Cannot make a website work,1,"Just gone to check in with BA for my flight to Sao Paulo.
Still watching whirling screens or blank ones several minutes later.
On on a 2nd Tab have logged on to LATAM, checked in, and printed boarding passes.
Enough said...

A minor inconveniance but still disgraceful"
British Airways,Came here to write a one star review,1,"Came here to write a one star review, and I'm not surprised in the slightest to see a horrifically poor rating for British Airways. It's so low, the kind of low you see for scam websites.

My first and last experience is due to the fact that they cancelled our flights that were due to depart on Boxing Day. They gave us no alternative carriers that we could fly with. I had to get a refund and fly with a different operator. With it being so much closer to Christmas we had to pay £2000 extra for our flights.

I started a complaint with BA but have been effectively ignored. Completed ghosted. I shall be complaining externally about this terrible organisation but either way, I'll never travel with them again. I hope they go bust."
British Airways,BRITISH AIRWAYS AWFUL SERVICE,1,"I have Been flying with British Airways for many years.

Last September, I flew to Atlanta to visit my sister and because I have bad knees I paid for a seat upgrade so that I would have more legroom, Before my flight. I was told I could no longer have the seats, they didn’t explain why just put me into a regular seat with poor legroom, I was informed that I could claim my money back once I had returned to the UK.

I put in my claim when I returned in October 2024, and received an email giving me a case number and telling me that it will be dealt with as soon as possible. I have now been waiting almost 3 months for my money back, I’ve contacted them on numerous occasions only to be told that it’s in a queue And that I can’t speak to the relevant department who deals with this. Today, I tried using the chat line who couldn’t understand a word I was saying as it’s obviously a robot. I spent 25 minutes trying to get my point across with no help whatsoever and I can’t find a telephone number where I can talk to the relevant people dealing with my claim. VERY POOR SERVICE!"
British Airways,Absolutely horrible,1,"Absolutely horrible, from the prices, to the planes, to the customer service... the only functioning person in this company is the guy who flights the plane."
British Airways,Zero stars is not an option sadly,1,"Zero stars is not an option sadly! Please do not book with this awful company. I booked a flight through BA to Isle of Man with Loganair (probably a bad idea in retrospect but BA have representatives in Manchester airport and Loganair don’t). Loganair cancelled the flight after a 3 hour delay but someone at BA marked the flight as 52 minutes late rather than cancelled! I’ve spent over 70 days arguing and proving to BA that the flight was cancelled but due to the special way that BA control the customer complaints department, you can’t speak to the person or department dealing with it. You have to call the customer‘helpline’ which is far from helpful. They have no power, won’t put you through to the correct people, claim that they can’t call Loganair or look on Manchester airports historic flight website to see that the flight was cancelled in fact they do very little! They can’t even put you on to their supervisor! I have now had apparent confirmation that they finally agree that the flight was cancelled and have promised a refund but that will take a further 10 days. Avoid this shower like the plague!!"
British Airways,Ridiculously expensive seats and luggages,1,"Bought the tickets. Didn't think to buy the seats as they were always free.
Now, I have to buy 4 seats. Cost 480 pounds! It would have cost me less if I buy the most expensive ticket, but they don't explain you this when you are purchasing the tickets.
Same for luggage. I am not going to buy them, but they charge 160 pounds per luggage!
I am going to through away my BA credit cards and never ever buy again flights with this company, far far worse than the so called budget ones.

I can see they don't even care. They do no reply to complaints and bad reviews."
British Airways,Great Flight. Great Crew.BA0662,5,"Check in at Larnaca first class, electric scooter checked in with no problem. Passenger assistance at Larnaca extremely efficient as their kerbside assistance phones actually work.

Boarding and greeting by Flight and Cabin crew amazing .My wife is disabled, and the crew looked after us superbly well from take off to landing.

A perfect end to a superb British Airways Holiday in Limassol over the festive period."
British Airways,What a joke of a company,1,"What a joke of a company. Talk about destroying what was once a major UK brand to be proud of. Don't know where to start.... let's start at the beginning, their website when trying to book. Glitches and crashes constantly, and repeatedly asking for the same information. Customer Service is another pathetic offering. I've been unable to change a return flight online, can't do it through chat, and via the telephone number for the past 3 days I get 'we're taking large volumes of calls at the moment so please try again later' 3 days!!!!. The value of Avios points have diminished over the years are becoming worthless now, and often unusable. In flight experience isn't much better, with poor staff attitude, forcing passengers to line up for boarding the plane isn't ready to boarding, just to meet timing quotas, smaller legroom in economy than some of the budget airlines, and European business class, no more than a free middle seat, and a drink and a rather tasteless lunch offering. Sean Doyle the CEO, you should hang your head in shame. Maybe take sometime looking at your competitors such as Virgin, Qatar and Emirates, who clearly know how to deliver world class service and treat their customers with dignaty and respect. BA's decline started over 20 odd years ago and continues to this day. Get back to basics, start with investing in customer service, stop gouging for every penny, recreate loyalty. You're lucky you have the Heathrow slots, otherwise you'd be destroyed by the competition.

Follow up note the day after the review above - BA website and customer service centre down today...'""call back in 2 hours and maybe it will be sorted""... gets better!!!!!"
British Airways,I'd like to thank Kate Roche in…,5,"I'd like to thank Kate Roche in Customer services (Birmingham) for her help with my flight booking. Kate went above and beyond to ensure my father and I were seated together (him with an aisle seat) and on the same flights, combining two separate reference numbers for easy reference. Kate's manner and knowledge was impeccable. Thank you."
British Airways,No catering on flight in business class,1,We are very frequent travellers on BA with significant status which is why we were somewhat surprised when following there being no catering on our business class flight back to London Heathrow BA did not even respond to us raising a complaint and closed the case without notifying us. I am not quick to complain but this is just the kind of behaviour of a company that will make sure customers will not support them in the future. I may be one of them.
British Airways,Poor service and no reward for loyalty,1,"After having had to wait for more than 1.5 hrs for my “priority” luggage at 5am Heathrow T5 3/1/25 and with the recent changes to the executive club I expect that I have taken my last flight with them. I raised a complaint but have had no feedback or apology. After years of loyalty I have seen the service go downhill and the shabby aircraft, disinterested staff and poor arrivals service just sum up how I feel about BA these days. In a way, I am grateful that I have been given the opportunity to explore other airlines."
British Airways,A final nail in the coffin!,1,"The death of British airways. Came here to leave bad review following recent rewards program shake up. But can see that BAs reputation on here is already in tatters!

For anyone that hasn't looked into the finer detail of the resent BA rewards changes, be ready for a reality shock. The gas lighting from the company is beyond out of this world! Any rewards for long term loyalty for this overpriced poor service Arline are now well and truly gone! As soon as my exec club card runs out... i like many others, am outa here!

Well done BA!"
British Airways,Efficient helpful professional airline,5,"Booked my trip to Australia
Aurlijecused Qatar also
Business class
Great booking
And customer service desk at Sydney airport went above and beyond to support me with a flight change x
Will definitely fly BA in future"
British Airways,Gobsmackingly inept company,1,"Gobsmackingly inept company. Left an item on the plane to NYC JFK. The BA website says contact the airport. The airport says call the BA number at the airport. Two days later and no answer. The BA website complaints form doesn’t work. Tried on three different devices and a complaint can’t be submitted. Yes the plane flew, and yes we didn’t die. But surely other parts of the service matter LIKE ANSWERING YOUR PHONE. Avoid BA like the plague."
British Airways,Very poor customer service,1,"Very poor customer service. My flight was cancelled, limited communication. Incurred lots of additional costs, no compensation from BA or support on info required to make a claim with my travel insurance provider."
British Airways,BA what a change in 25years!,1,"I haven’t flown with BA for 25 years what a change! Aircraft tired and dreary - crew no better. Food was disgusting. Aircraft A380 was cold - no water in toilet for washing hands staff provided a bottle - door didn’t close properly. TVs weren’t working great. Flight delayed with poor excuse. Then had to wait 2 hours for luggage to come through. BA used to be top notch - gone right downhill - will not be flying again. Experience with short haul flying with Jet2 so much better!! Really disappointed, especially as fares not cheap!"
British Airways,Smooth ride,5,"After not flying long haul for 8 years due to health issues, I was pleasantly surprised by BA. I had to sort out oxygen for the flight and the medical assistance Team was most helpful. The care and attention given to me on my outward and inward flight to Singapore was appreciated. Wheelchair assistance & Oxygen was provided whilst cruising. Thank you BA for ensuring my Journey went smoothly. I will definitely be looking into booking a 2nd trip."
British Airways,Never again … an abysmal airline,1,"We had a BA overnight flight to and from Heathrow to Johannesburg (out Dec 24 back Jan 25) and it was a complete nightmare. Both planes were filled with business class seats with economy crammed in at the final third of the plane, the space allocated to an economy seat is abysmal, so uncomfortable and a tight squeeze getting in and out, even when empty of people! The seats hardly recline and are more uncomfortable when reclined but the worst part is the seat itself, no padding at all, I suffer from sciatica but even my husband who does not found the seats impossible they were so hard with no padding. This is not acceptable on such a long flight. I was in agony on both flights. The cabin was so warm and on this plane those adjustable tiny fans above your head do not exist. The food too was horrible, pasta with tomato sauce only! The worst bit however was the return flight, we landed (with numerous excuses from the captain about a fault on the plane which personally I find scary) only to be left sitting on the boiling hot plane for a further 1.5 hours because there were no bus drivers to take us from the plane to the terminal. Our flight cost more than £1100 each, we will never fly BA again."
British Airways,Outstanding service when flying to…,5,Outstanding service when flying to United States of America. And returning travelled with my disabled daughter she was treated with respect and kindness from the start to finish
British Airways,They couldn’t care less,1,"Flight from Oslo was at 19.25, we didn’t leave until 23:10 landed at Birmingham, busses to Heathrow (our actual destination) for 5am. It’s now 9:10am the next day. Apparently my hand luggage isn’t important enough to be sent and only MIGHT be on the 16:30 flight. Appealing service with no customer care what so ever. We have been left to sit in a cafe"
British Airways,BA has gone from bad to worse- even…,1,"BA has gone from bad to worse- even though I did not think that was actually possible

Abysmal customer service

Out performed by many low cost operators whilst continuing to charge premium prices

Recent flight to LHR left us waiting for bags for over 1.5 hours at terminal five. When I approached customer service to complain I was told this was normal service and what did I expect if I had been so stupid as to book in a checked bag for my flight

No care. No willingness to provide decent customer care"
British Airways,Awful experience,1,"Awful experience. 40 mins to check in baggage. Flight delayed more than 1hour. Waiting in queue at Barcelona lost luggage with 100 other people. No skis. I will never use this absolute shower again. Of course, there is no-one answering any of the customer service numbers."
British Airways,Terrible changes to BA Executive Club,1,Terrible changes to BA Executive Club. I have just attained Silver Status and terrified to find out it will be near impossible to retain Silver now. I am even unsure if I will keep the Silver Status for the usual 12/15 months which used to be the case. What a bad timing for me - just the moment I reached the Silver; BA changed their rules after many decades. I am seriously considering to fly with other airlines now after flying with BA for almost 33 years! Insult to injury for my loyalty. Truly heartbroken. Shame on BA!
British Airways,Legroom in Economy is crippling.,2,"Legroom in Economy is crippling.
Upgraded to Premium Economy for return flight. While usual food in Premium is also upgraded, gluten free option is still frankly appalling. Same meal served twice for both hot meals on way out! Fruit salad is a dreary unimaginative dessert!! All was dry and unappetising. Breakfast on return was a dry, dry, dry omelette while husband and son enjoyed bacon and sausage. Bacon is GF, as are mushrooms, why not include them?"
British Airways,The worst customer service,1,"The worst customer service ! Avoid BA at all costs !!’ Incompetent customer service staff ! Will not use BA again !
Seating leg space in economy is worse than other cheaper budget airlines !
BA have removed the air fans overhead from some seats to Penny pinch ! Disgraceful!"
British Airways,No rules or regulations?,1,Customer service told me they cannot tell me if I will get charged for an over sized bag or not. Said there are no rules or regulations that the staff follow and it's at the check in person's digression. I guess it's just a luck of the draw?
British Airways,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,1,"Had a decent flight with them in the past, I placed a booking that I cancelled and they sent the refund to the wrong account. I chased them for 4-5 MONTHS! I was being mis informed, gaslit and lied to just kept being ansked to wait annd they would anssure me it would be resolved, I wait annd call back annd it’s an different story. absolutely horrible customer service. How in one phone call I’m getting told 3 different things. I was even told I would get a call back from a manager on 3 occasions, I was the one calling this company. I called around 20 times in total only to find out I’m being gaslit the entire time. I filed a complaint on their website and all they do is offer me £50 voucher? Wtf am I gonna do with that when my flight was £300. British airways can sk itself sideways."
British Airways,Had an issue through no fault of BA and…,5,"Had an issue through no fault of BA and had to change flight
We were travelling with 2 older people.

The staff were so helpful and understanding.
Our flight was protected and they were extremely helpful in rebooking .
There was no mention of admin costs extra fees etc

The staff were friendly and competent."
British Airways,Possibly the Worst Website a Mediocre Airline Ever Had,1,"Following a grueling journey from EDI to AKL and back again during which time my checked bag was lost twice I cannot reccomend this airline.

Regarding the airline itself, none of the four flights I took with them (half of which were over 8 hours in length) were on time. The first was over an hour late resulting in me being rebooked The second (which left before I arrived, but somehow carried one of my bags?) was an hour earlier than when I booked it. The third, due to a broken groundside air conditioner was also delayed, much of which saw me sweating my trecherous life away on a sweltering plane, that were it to just take off would be so much colder. The final flight was also a tad early, and was also missed due to a couple hours of delay.

Beyond this, they lost my bag. Their website was repeatedly down due to ""high demandm,"" generally sluggish, and the section for tracking my bag was hidden through several confusingly titled links.

British Airways desperately needs to get their act together, I have had worse experiences flying, but not many."
British Airways,Evil and Illegal. Truly unscrupulous.,1,"Never again will I fly with this airline. First, they cancelled my flight within 24 hours of its due departure. Then they tried to mislead and obsfucate their obligations to pay me eu entitled compensation for this which they actively lied to me over, which is actually against eu/uk law.

When I finally threatened to go to an ombudsman they relented, and paid me the minimum possible amount they could.

As for when I made a change? Their teams mucked it up repeatedly and when I pushed them to remove the change fee given my extremely unpleasant experience up until that point, they finally did... only to still charge me the fair difference.

When my father died months later and I had to change again, they did offer me a single free change due to ""compassionate circumstances"" but they had made a mistake and had not even finalised the prior change, but that didn't stop them hunting me like bloodhounds though the period of my father's passing and after for their money to cover that unfinalized change.

Their teams were rude, uncaring, and agressive at times, and I cannot describe how disgusting the conduct was at times.

A few of their social staff were nice, but I will never, ever forgive this airline for not only lying to me, but for then piling on the misery during the hardest time or my life. And to be clear, their compensation team move to thd very limits, and exceed them, of the time lines they are expected to by eu law.

A joke of a shadow of what it once was, ba is now worse than any budget airline I've flown, including Ryanair, in service and flexibility."
British Airways,Greed,1,Just paid over £6000 for two Business Class seats and the robbing pigs want another £336 to pre-assign seats. BA you are an utter national disgrace. No doubt management and shareholders will trouser the cash leaving the hard working staff and crew short as usual.
British Airways,WARNING: TIER program ENDED by gangster BA now need to spend more than $12k to qualify as silver elite,1,"In a move without parallel even in the sleazy world of modern day aviation, BA today basically secretly ended its tier program as of April 1st. You will now have to spend approximately more than $12,000.00 US to achieve silver status (taxes do not count) as BeAwful becomes an only the wealthy can fly carrier. I have written demanding refunds for future flights which I bought under false pretenses and you should too."
British Airways,Pathetic and misleading customer service,1,"Waited at airport for 2 hours for my luggage only to find out they left it at source… no announcement etc..

Got the luggage delivered at home but damaged..

Filed claim, person recommended to buy replacement which did but now stopped responding to refund my money…
Been 2 months now"
British Airways,The slowest most clunky IT of any airline,1,"The slowest most clunky IT of any airline I have used. I have the app and blue “Executive Club” membership. Both the app and website are excruciatingly slow and constantly kicking me out. Linking membership benefits/Avios points to a booking does not work.
BA IT department should employ someone from EasyJet or Jet2 to show them how to build a customer friendly IT platform. If these “budget” airlines flew across the Atlantic I would use them in preference to the terrible BA booking system.
And why does BA only open on line check in 24 hours before the flight. The budget airlines manage this so much better"
British Airways,Where to start 😡,1,"Where to start 😡
From having flights cancelled.. to lack of communication to then delayed flights and attitude from staff at the gate, This is the first time I have flown with BA and never ever again…I would advise if you have an alternative then avoid BA at all costs"
British Airways,Autistic son assaulted by cabin crew,1,"Hi British airways, the airline that’s “won an award” for its recognition towards autistic passengers. My 7 year old autistic son was assaulted by James, a member of your cabin crew on board the flight from Islamabad to Gatwick airport nearly 3 weeks ago. You still have not replied to my email. I suggest you take this very seriously unless you would like me to take this to the papers and upload it all over social media. To be honest I’m more tempted to upload my video over TikTok than report this to the police, maybe that will get your attention."
British Airways,The only gripe I have is their policy…,3,"The only gripe I have is their policy of hand luggage which is allowed in the cabin. Rather than pay for baggage allowance, which is charged seperately, more and more people are bringing ever larger suitcases onto the plane. As a result their is no room for traditonal hand luggage in overhead compartments so we had to fly with it under the seat in front which leaves no room for our legs to go which is an issue when you are 6ft+. BA, please find a solution to this as it makes flying in economy which is never that comfortable even worse."
British Airways,"Lies, gaslighting, and more lies!",1,I’d never recommend flying with British Airways. I had a terrible experience in October. They cancelled my flight for no reason and booked me on flight that left 17 hours later. This happened after I had arrived at the airport. I called customer service and they told me to just book with a different airline and request a refund. I did that and when I called back for a refund the agent tried telling me that my flight was leaving as scheduled!!! After all the stress and panic that was not what I wanted to hear. It took about 10 minutes for him to realize it had been cancelled. It took 2 calls and 2 chat sessions for receive a refund that only went onto my credit card 6 weeks after I first requested it. Now I need documentation for travel insurance for the extra $1000 I spent on a new flight. It’s been 3 months and British airways still hasn’t provided the proper documents. Stay away if you want to enjoy a vacation! I travel once a year typically and never experienced anything as terrible as British Airways.
British Airways,Lack of customer care,1,"Like so many others I have been left disappointed by BA. They were ‘the go to airline,’ for many years; but have become ‘the steer clear/find any alternative carrier.’
My flight was cancelled and the replacement flight would have meant missing an important family occasion the following day. Although I managed to get home the new flight cost more than I was ‘refunded.’ I was not seeking compensation for the stress and inconvenience caused or the extra expense that the charge of flight incurred. However,I did ask for the difference in the cost between the two flights. Three months after my request and constant thanks for ‘waiting for an answer,’ I was told on Christmas Day that their records show I had been given a full refund. This means that in all that time my request had been ignored/rejected and sidelined like so many others! This is not about the money but customer care and listening."
British Airways,Avoid when possible,1,"Used to be a respectable company, is now a joke. My flight was cancelled and rebooked for a full day after, resulting in me missing a morning of meetings in Frankfurt. I received TWO emails from them confirming that it was due to operational issues (not enough operative aircrafts), and this was also all over the news that day. They've now changed their version and say that it was adverse weather, so that they don't have to pay compensation (ooh whoops, silly us for sending you random emails, just discard them). Additionally, it's quite ridiculous that they don't offer included hold luggage when you book long haul. I couldn't be more disappointed in them."
British Airways,Disgrace Great British Airways,1,"Disgrace Great British Airways

Flights become delayed that is standard. We asked for additional water and steward with a long face decided to give it. Wow.

3 hours of waiting for luggage!!!!!

Never again we will check in the luggage. Let them find the space in the aircraft!

Oh I would forget the customer service at the airport useless! Not nice!"
British Airways,British airways unfair practice,1,"British Airways has usually been good for me But I Took a return flight to England with British Airway before Christmas. I missed the early flight out and had to take a later SAS flight.I assumed that my return flight was valid. But could not login for the return flight. I had to purchase a second ticket to return to Denmark. So I was forced to pay for a flight I already had paid for.
Although I sent the ticket evidence to British Airways they have still not given me a refund."
British Airways,150 EUR for international call in attempt to change ticket,1,"I spent 1 hour and 20 minutes on the phone and payed 150 EUR to my mobile operator for the international calls in the attempt to change my business class ticket
Finally I had to buy a new ticket and pay the fool price second time
The reason - it is impossible to pay for a fresh booking on their web site - you have to voice and enter card details during the call but their system does not work properly
I wounded - why it is possible to pay on line for a new ticket but impossible when you changing expensive business class ticket?"
British Airways,This started with a cancelled flight,1,"This started with an email stating that my return flight from Barbados had been cancelled. No explanation and no offer of help. The advice was just check their website to rebook or claim a refund. Three weeks before I was supposed to fly out, a refund was of no use due to expensive accommodation bookings. The only flight on offer was 24 hours later. When rebooking, they even made me pay for seat selection again when I had already done this on the original booking. This was later refunded.
On my return home I lodged a claim for reimbursement of additional expenses, hotel. food and taxis but the website is not easy to navigate to find out what they pay and how to lodge the claim.
10 weeks later the status of the claim is simply ''received'' in other words no-one has progressed the claim. 10 weeks of inaction.
General customer service cannot access the claims process, all they say is that the team are very busy. They cannot provide a contact number to speak to the team so the customer is left entirely frustrated at the complete lack of customer service and accountability.
Like some of the other contributers, I think I have made my last booking with BA."
British Airways,More than one hour without pilot!!,1,"More than one hour without pilot!!! The information are not helpful and certainly.
First we are really impress about the service and the kindness. We booked more British airways and less eurowings. But things changed. Next time eurowings again!!"
British Airways,I honestly cannot believe this company…,1,"I honestly cannot believe this company is still in business. My flight BA0493 was delayed for more than 4 hours, and when we got to our destination they left our baggage at the airport!!! What an absolute disaster of an airline, I paid more money to fly on a BA flight over easyjet thinking the service would be better by my god it is the worst customer service i have ever experienced period.

This flight delay occurred in Jul 2024. We are now in Jan 2025 after i have put in a case and made multiple complaints, they still have not got back to me and every time i call I get there is nothing we can do and you need to contact complaint department. guess what complaints department cant be contacted except via email! and i still have never got a response. I literally have no clue where to go other than a claims solicitor. I hope this company can turn it around."
British Airways,I had a flight from Barcelona to…,1,I had a flight from Barcelona to Heathrow BA479 the 6th of January 2025. I travelled with an electric guitar wich was send through a special belt for fragile package. Once in Heathrow I received my baggage in the belt 8 but no guitar. That same day I needed my guitar because I’m a musician in a cruise ship. That day was a nightmare. How can special package get lost in a direct flight? There was another guy with the same problem. It seemed they didn’t upload the guitar in the plane so it was left in Barcelona. This is the claim number LHRBA71125. Please someone from the company I need urgent help.
British Airways,I can't believe what used to be the…,1,"I can't believe what used to be the crown jewels can be so poorly rated by most of it's customers. I've always enjoyed flying BA. Maybe 25 years with the exec club. Gold Guestlist for a while. Only Silver now as I've been focusing on the UK market with my work recently.

I booked a trip to Japan Dec '25 with my 2 young children. As I used Companion Voucher and Barclays Upgrade I was asked to make 2 separate bookings as the system couldn't handle it. I obliged. I was then told to seat my children next to me I'd have to pay. I complained and they offered me £100 off (so maybe pay over £300 for the fact the system couldn't cope with my request).

I sent in a written complaint. Obviously no reply as there's so many fires to put out.

I enquired about switching to Qatar airways club today. Think I'll leave and take my 1 million Avios with me."
British Airways,DO NOT FLY WITH BA!,1,"During a period of poor weather 6th Jan 2025 ( this is me being generous ) - although the flight was not disrupted - I flew from NCL to LHR arriving on time and made my way to the baggage reclaim hall in T5.

I had made sure that I had sufficient time to catch my connecting flight from T2, which I fly regularly each month, upon arrival I was forced to wait 2 1/2 hours for my bags to come from the carousel.

I approached the baggage service desk and was told that we are busy, it's very busy and nothing can be done.

I made my way to T2 after eventually getting my bag but I had missed my connection, I had to book an alternative flight to reach my destination, book a hotel for the night, feed myself and travel to and from the hotel I had to book all because because of BA I had missed my connecting flight.

I was dismissed from BA service desk as ""they couldn't help me because I wasn't flying with a partner airline"" and upon contacting them through their complaints/claims channel I have not received any response whatsoever!

Absolutely atrocious customer experience!"
British Airways,Here are my experiences of last 3…,1,"Here are my experiences of last 3 flights with BA flying from Heathrow to South Africa over the last 6 months:
~ First Flight: They forgot to load my wifes luggage at Heathrow
~ Second Flight: Delayed and this time they left my baggage behind at Heathrow
~ Third Flight: Cancelled and sent home to try again tomorrow. Complete fiasco by BA staff trying to sort out passengers by sending us around the airport to different gates without their staff knowing what to do with us when we got to the gates they told us to go to and sending us back again.
This company has fallen off a cliff and lacks leadership. They are a complete shower of incompetence."
British Airways,Spoke to Akshay from customer service…,5,Spoke to Akshay from customer service on the phone for 1hr 30 minutes. Very helpful!
British Airways,Appalling Service from Customer Relations Team regarding a refund,1,"As others have said appalling service from the Customer Relations team. I am owed for a hold bag that my daughter was charged for at the return airport despite me having paid for a hold bag 3 weeks earlier on line. It has now been 3 months and no information whatsoever regarding the progress of my claim, despite numerous emails and conversations with Customer Relations. The amount owed is not really the issue its the terrible service which will stop me using BA in the future."
British Airways,Shocking customer service - Lies and no complaints procedure,1,Outsourced customer service agents basically resort to lying to get you off the phone. They also get rude very quickly if you challenge them. Even more shocking is the lack of proper complaints process. A process I followed and months later I am yet to receive any response. Last resort is posting here on Trustpilot. I won't be so quick to use BA ever again.
British Airways,Terrible treatment on a business class…,1,"Terrible treatment on a business class flight from Washington DC to Heathrow when we were seated separately when the plane type changed and request to change seating at check in and with cabin crew was refused, leaving me distressed (I am a nervous flyer) Compounded by atrocious customer service when we complained. It has taken 4 months and a lot of effort on our part to get a refund for the money paid to choose our seats. Plus when we complained about the treatment by cabin crew and lack of care about my distress we were sent an e-voucher as an ""apology"", and they refused to give cash instead so the apology is empty as we won't be flying with BA again now"
British Airways,BA data breach & account hacked no help,1,"I went to book flights using my airmiles to discover that my account had been hacked. I called BA who said someone had changed the email address, they would freeze the account and come back to me in 2 weeks. 2 weeks later I called for progress to find they wouldn’t talk to me as wrong email address after over 1 hour of arguing they believed me. Said the previous agent should have changed the email address so would send me a link and it would take 72 hours to change! I questioned the hackers having access to my account and they said as 2 factor authentication no problem. I asked them for the mobile number on the account and the hackers had changed that too. I managed to change the email address back and then received an email with an email trail from Jonathan on 9/12/24 where he had emailed the hackers saying there was suspicious activity on the account and airmiles had been stolen. So BA had emailed the hackers where they still had access to my account! I chased this, pointed this out and asked for an investigation to the data breach only to receive an email to say my airmiles had been reinstated and case closed! I’ve called 3 times to be told I need to speak to Newcastle but everytime I call I get put through to India and there is no number for Newcastle so I’m told to raise a complaint online. I’ve filled out a case complaint 3 times and no one has come back to me. Serious data breach, I’ve had to book the flights I wanted with to book with my airmiles paying cash with another airline as by the time they sorted the issue they said would take 2 weeks ended up taking 6 weeks so the flights were gone. I would like BA to come back to me on this before this data breach is reported."
British Airways,Fabulous service Heathrow to Madrid,5,"I hardly ever do reviews and I felt that I had to review the flight I took from Heathrow to Madrid on 10/01/2025 at 7.25am.
The Captain (Gary) was apologetic and kept us well informed as we were 1.5 hours late taking off (due to issues in Madrid, not Heathrow). ALL of the staff were in a good mood and so polite and helpful. Diego gave me some recommendations of where to go and what to eat in Madrid. I was taking my friend to Madrid as she had turned 50 two days before and I told the cabin staff this and they opened us a bottle of champagne and gave it to us for free, in glasses. They made sure we was happy throughout and my friend and I thought it was such a lovely touch (we were only in economy) that it really set the mood for our trip. So thank you to Diego, Olivia and I think her name was Nahum for looking after us at the back. Also to Gary who came to see us at the end of our flight and shook our hands. Its not often airline staff get praise but we felt they deserved it."
British Airways,Is there a way to to give less then 1…,1,"Is there a way to to give less then 1 star ?

Bookings are cancelled 4hrs before flight , not any mention of compensation , no replacement flights were booked after cancellations the only email was sent about their survey but not on rebooking or cancellation and ofc the staff showing no empathy on call . Not even a link to where one could be claim the added expenses of the hotel , food , transportation to the airport... Nothing .
Please 🙏 tell me how can a company that has been around for 50 years be so bad ."
British Airways,Worse than Ryanair,1,"Up there with the worst airlines in the western world. Just a much more expensive Ryanair. Almost always something wrong with the website and don't even think about trying to call the two people they have working on the phonelines. Avoid them at all costs if possible.,"
British Airways,I have been waiting nearly 2 weeks for…,1,"I have been waiting nearly 2 weeks for BA customer services to contact me in respect of wrongly adding my sisters middle name
as her surname to the booking. My mistake!!
Called the Customer Services team who confirmed I needed to send a copy of her passport to amend the booking and gave me an email address. This was duly sent, no response to date! I don’t expect to wait 2 weeks with NO response so very disappointed. I am now having to call them again!"
British Airways,BA is killing itself off.,1,"What on earth have BA done!

The new loyalty scheme changes spell disaster for this company. Dont be fooled by the gaslighting people.

the spend tiers announced are before tax. Reality is we will all now have to fly (for example) at least 15 flights (avg. £280 per flight) a year to only qualify for Bronze. 30+ flighst on same working for silver!!!!

Despite my loyal custom and travelling over 300,000 miles with BA in the last 17 years, now i cant even get bronze! No point sticking with BA anymore!

I guess many of us with avois were looking for a reason to leave this airline. Great news for EasyJet etc."
British Airways,BA reveal themselves as vicious and uncaring,1,"I paid £4000+ for one week in Malaga for two people - flights and hotel.
Original flight was cancelled at short notice. The next flight was delayed by over 6 hours with no communication from BA whatsover. The above was only a small part of the problem and can be excused slightly as the weather was to blame.
However, it was our arrival at the hotel and our treatment that I was shocked and dismayed about.
Due to the delay, we didn't arrive at the hotel until 1am
We were told that our whole booking had been cancelled by BA.
Eventually, after paying 690 euros, we were given a tiny noisy room for 1 night and made aware that under no uncertain terms would there be a room available for the rest of the holiday.
Next morning, after multiple phone calls to BA, we were found a large sea view room, which we had already paid for and lost 2 nights in.
I requested BA refund for these 2 nights but was gobsmacked to be told - No -
They refused further discussion on the matter and to my horror I have since found out they are not ABTA protected.
In fact they have no resolution solutions at all. They are a law unto themselves.
Buyer beware - all is great until there's a hiccup when they will reveal themselves to be the most vicious, money grabbing and uncaring travel company you will ever come across. Do not book unless you can afford to lose a lot of money."
British Airways,Truly the WORST airline out there - 0 stars!!!,1,"British Airways has truly failed as a company in terms of their customer service. It is non-existent. I would never EVER fly again with them if I wasn’t part of the Avios programme. If something goes wrong, do not expect to receive a resolution. No member of staff will accept responsibility for anything and there is no one to complain to - the complaints section on the website is absolutely useless as no one bothers to respond."
British Airways,Great service,5,"Just had the most amazing service from Lindsey, we had to rebook our holiday and she made it so simple for us with lots of patience. Thank you"
British Airways,British airways,1,"The flight was ok. But my stay in Manchester was for 4 days, and to my surprise no bag came from London to Manchester after being delayed 2 hours. So i no clothing to change to. 2 bag came to the hotel on the 3er day of are stay late night last day 1.
No compensation no call no nothing customer services is the worst’s. Do not fly BA. Local they are very very bad."
British Airways,Arrogant and rude BA staff at the gate…,1,"Arrogant and rude BA staff at the gate in Heathrow demanding to forcefully hand over cabin luggage which is allowed onboard threatening to take people off the flght, delay the flight or cancel the flight altogether. Customer experience has reached new levels. Perhaps training for the BA gate staff nowadays organised by ex-mafia personnel. Even refused to tell their names to raise a complaint despite already wearing name tags. Probably should give them number tags, a bit like the riot police officers. I had to give one star since there was no option for zero. Trustpilot overall score ‘bad’ tells it all, doesn’t it. BA world’s most arrogant and rude airline."
British Airways,Still waiting for Refund,1,"Before I start - BA staff on planes are great most the time...helpful, pleasant...as you would expect. But wow, the customer support both at Heathrow or remote is either no existent or be as well.... zero help, getting passed from department to another, it is truly frustrating experience. I've been trying to get a refund, that is owed for seat downgrading of whole family, since October 18th and despite trying to contact BA, I have yet to receive the refund owed or even get an update on the status (despite following the online guidance) This once great airline is now in the 3rd Division of Airlines and to be honest be as well moving aside and letting a proper Airline company run the business."
British Airways,BA worst airline in the WORLD!!,1,"I want to understand why I can’t rate the as 0. 1 is a huge overrating for this clown company. I was a gold card holder 7 years ago and would only fly BA. Last year they cancelled my return flight whilst on holiday with my whole family with 10 days notice. 6 months later they have just declined our compensation as we had to pay our £2000 for replacement flights, extra nights accommodation, extra day car hire. Their reason: they cancelled the flight for ‘Commercial Reasons’!!!!! So why do I foot the bill for their commercial issues?!?!?! These clowns may think I will leave it here but rest assured I will take this to ombudsman followed by legal firms AND I will be claiming every single penny I am entitled too. I really hope that at some point a Class Action is brought against BA as you can read thousands of similar experiences online and they seem to get away with their inept customer service and ability to stress customers for 6-12 months as I can ill afford £2000 on top of my holiday cost for reasons that an airline simply cancelled my flight and provided no alternative leaving me to book a replacement. The final point of note was that I booked a Vueling flight (which they told me they could not transfer me too as they had no agreement with the airline) AND wait for it, the payment on my statement for that flight went to BRITISH AIRWAYS!!!!!!!!!! 🤡"
British Airways,Last 2 flights lost all bags,1,Last 2 flights lost all bags. This flight get me in to Heathrow T5 and I have a connection. 45mins to make outside same terminal. Than a get a completely horrible woman who says you won't back that flight gonand stand in this huge line. We said we can still make the original flight but she had her little bit of power and she was loving it. I said look can you just let us go and we can have a go at making this? She then said I was annoying her which really pleased me so she then call the security balloons. They asked what I was doing? I told them nothing speak to the head dispatcher as she seen herself. So now we have a 3hr wait while that person looks on laughing as of she has won't some big moral victory. She is noting bit a small slow minded individual who should be fires for her shocking service. I keep saying to more BAs BS and this time I'm done. I'll take KLM or American. They won't be worse than this shower of small minded morons. ADIOD BA after 30yrs
British Airways,BA is such a joke,1,"Such an absolute joke. Delay of more than one hour and a half for a flight of 1 hour. In addition, everyone received a message saying they didn't have time to load the luggage.... An absolutely ridiculous service."

I swore I'd never again to book them, but flying with others who booked them ... but now NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER again!

In simple terms it doesn't deserve to survive as a business.

Will use my miles on a partner programme."
British Airways,0 stars,1,"Stayed in London for a few days with foggy weather all throughout - 5 hours before my flight home it got cancelled because of the weather. No information on compensation, new flight from a different airport, etc. Not one warning email that it MIGHT be cancelled the day before but i got asked to fill out a survey instead..
Even the flight to London was delayed. No empathy whatsoever from the staff on service Hotline. Will never fly with them again, 0/5 stars, dont recommend."

British Airways,We were booked to sit upstairs on the…,1,We were booked to sit upstairs on the A380 for my son for Christmas he was so excited ! Day before we tried to check in and they had moved us ! I paid 250.00 and I didn’t get any notification that we couldn’t sit upstairs and I still have had no refund. Thanks for the not so great start to the Christmas holiday and a very sad little boy who loves planes.
British Airways,BA YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES,1,"We flew from Edinburgh to London Heathrow and connected from London Heathrow to Rome. Got on the plane at Edinburgh and two people decided that they didn’t want to fly. Delayed whilst they got their cases off. The conveyor belt broke down whilst they were doing this. Waited on an engineer coming eventually arrived fixed that we missed our slot. Eventually arrived into Heathrow and met at the gate given a ticket to say our next flight was at 7pm given a £10 meal voucher with a 7 hour delay ahead of us, wouldn’t even buy you a sandwich and a drink. Told to go to customer services. There was an earlier flight at 2pm ish we asked if we couldn’t get on? My son looked on line and we could buy 4 tickets on that flight despite being told there was no seats and showing the lady the flights on his phone. Told we should go to the gate at that time and they would see what they could do, we never got on. Our original flight from Edinburgh was 8.05 arrive London Heathrow 9.35 leave Heathrow 11.50 arrive Rome 15.25. So over two hours between flights. This happened on the 21st June, they did eventually after several emails back and forth with my son who claimed for 4 of us. They admitted they were liable for compensation this was 11th January 2025 and asked for my sons bank details. He sent them and reminded them that there was 4 of us. They then emailed back to say they weren’t paying compensation we had plenty of time to catch our flight and all they would pay was the extra taxi fare we had to get. It was after midnight when we eventually arrived in Rome. To say BA are one of the best airlines to travel with and this is the shoddy treatment we have received is beyond me. You can’t speak to anyone, I think nearly an 8 month wait is unreasonable and BA should be ashamed of themselves. I personally think your just going to get fed up and go away!! Well I can tell you BA we are NOT going away and we will continue to fight for what we are owed."
British Airways,Book flight from Dublin to Miami,1,"Book flight from Dublin to Miami, entered credit card details then for error message ""if you do not get an confirmation email with 30 mins need to rebook"". No email after an hour so rebooked only to get 2 emails later that both booking made and charged. Been onto chat and phone for 2 days only to be told I have been refunded £108.00 for flights that cost over £3000.00 and they don't know why I have not got a full refund, pathetic!"
British Airways,The best of the best - our pilot.,5,"I hope British Airways reads and passes on reviews but I am sceptical. This one is for the pilot of BA 212 departing 31/12/24 BOS-LHR. The landing on the morning of 01/01/25 at LHR was immaculate. And I mean immaculate. I have flown millions of miles. The wind was treacherous, the wings seesawing up and down right up to the moment of touchdown. The pilot timed his touch down so perfectly the wheels all touched at the same time and the plane stayed straight as an arrow (787 is not a small plane!). Barely felt a thing. No bumps at all.

Pilots do not get enough credit. This Captain executed to a standard he should be proud of.

British Airways have ruined their product over the past decade and have hurt their staff with contract changes, however they manage to retain well educated, well spoken and highly competent pilots. Well done and thank you to our pilot."
British Airways,Gone down the pan,1,"Absolutely terrible… had my first flight cancelled and had to go through the rigmarole of spending an hour on hold/dealing with agent to sort out..
App is completely useless to try and get boarding passes just wants you to download to get avios offers and personal information .. another flag ship business gone down the drain I will never use again"
British Airways,Full marks to BA,5,"I realise I am going against the general tone of reviews but I have give BA full marks for service on our recent flight to Chicago.
Check-In at Club World was excellent. I have a US visa in my old passport and it’s always faff to register it but the person issuing our tickets persevered.
The Club lounge was most almost full but we found seats, however they will have to expand soon such are the number of business class passengers now using it.
On board the new pods are far more comfortable than the old ones and the supplemental wine list had Whispering Angel my favourite Rose’ also no issues with the amount offered or the food menu.
Choice of movies was good and the eight flight passed quickly.
In conclusion I think BA have got their act together.
Full disclosure my IAG shares have pretty much doubled in the last few months."

British Airways,"One of the worst airlines, ashamed its British",1,"Flew BA for our honeymoon, and they messed up so much of it that we missed a day of our honeymoon and faced expenses as a result that they refuse compensate us for. What’s worse than that is that theyve taken no responsibility and refused to communicate about complaints any other way than on email, and yet won’t respond to emails either. I feel like the government needs to regulate this sector to prevent scam airlines like BA from swindling customers and force them to take responsibility. They have ridden on their brand equity they’ve built in previous decades for too long and unfortunately for them they’ve used up all of the public’s good will and faith in them. Now with the latest changes to the points system they will only deal with business flyers, perhaps that’s the aim!"

I wrote down a complaint at Lisbon airport and am still awaiting K2 Global/British Airways' answer. It has ""just"" been more than 6 months. The claim (ref.

So, I call BA - a 30 minute wait and then the usual long security (when I was already logged in an had to provide my password, flight PIN, etc). The call centre woman has to consult a colleague about my request and comes back with a charge of £300 for me making the change plus the difference in the price of the flight (which she couldn' tell me).
So, BA changes my flight and wants me to pay for a reasonable connection. BA are insulting - and a rip-off."
British Airways,Absolutely unbelievably bad service,1,"Absolutely unbelievable. I am travelling back to the UK, bringing my wife and kids with me. There are two bookings.

The service from start to finish is nothing oriented to the paying customer . This airline is corporate greed. And being in-flight and treated poorly by the staff is a disappointing. Don't really recommend flying with this company again I'm sticking to another airline."
British Airways,Overbooked flight,1,"Was put on standby due to BA overbooking the flight by 12 people even though I booked 6 months ago. Apparently they do this regularly. After much waiting and stress, was put on the same flight 24hrs later. Had to pay for taxis and food at a nearby hotel with my own money, and missed a day and night of my trip. Had no responses to my complaints. Very disappointed and would not recommend."
British Airways,British Airways ( thieving company ),1,Not so much as a review as a complaint against the total contempt for customers who travel on their flights. I find it despicable that they charge for seating prior to check in but to raise prices from £37 to £59 per person each way is downright robbery. If I could fly direct to San Diego with anyone else I would but the only other option is to LAX which is awful. If I could give zero I would and as soon as I can find another carrier I will. Zero customer care and utter contempt for customers
British Airways,Another fine mess BA,1,"Another fine mess BA - coming back from Geneva a whole pallet of ski bags and other bags did not make the flight. The Flight crew including Captain would have known bags were missing as aircraft centre of gravity would have been recalculated. No passenger was informed, no announcement made, and as a result we all hung around in baggage collection for nearly 2 hours waiting for bags that never even boarded. I can understand a missing bag but a missing Pallet of bags with no information to passengers - a complete shambles BA - yet another reason not to fly BRITSH AIRWAYS. BA 741 Geneva to LHR (NVKO9K). AS for flying Business Class forget it - last bags out on way out to Geneva which makes me think what does Priority handling actually mean. If this is the finest BA can offer it is utter garbage."
British Airways,Absolutely Shocking Customer Service for Refund,1,"Our flight was cancelled 12 hours before we were due to fly home on Sunday 8 Dec from Dusseldorf to Heathrow with an alternative flight being offered for the Tuesday! With jobs, children, pets there was no way we could wait to return home 2 1/2 days later! After a very stressful 2 hours trying to rebook flights, we finally managed to book another flight for the Sunday evening but back to Birmingham. We then had to get an Uber home, then catch a train the following evening to collect our car from Heathrow.

After all this, I then had to submit a compensation claim to which I was told because they were refunding me for the original return flight, they wouldn't pay for the new flight at a cost of E650!

I am still waiting for the refund for the original flight, after 4 times of chasing, being told that it had been sent to the wrong department, so had to be resent and would take 7-10 business days to now being told that it's still not resolved and I need to wait a few more days. Absolutely shocking customer service from BA. I won't use again!"
British Airways,Truly disgraceful website and app,1,"How bad can the technology of a company be. If this is a question you have ever asked yourself, just go to BA.com. The company is truly awful. I am an executive club member and wanted to check a flight, I signed in and was confronted by this
“ Verify Your Identity
Check your preferred one-time password application for a code.”

I don’t have a preferred application and BA certainly isn’t on any of my Authenticator apps. Well done BA, you are not letting me have access to my account.

I decided to use my BA app on my phone and got the following message “Sorry, we can’t currently show all of your bookings. We’re trying to fix this …..” Bla, bla, bla.

How this airline can carry the word ‘British’ in its name is shocking."
British Airways,Dear OWNERS of British Airlines,1,"Dear OWNERS of British Airlines

I am writing to express my concerns regarding a recent experience with British Airways that I found to be quite disappointing.

Flight BA 0552 of January 12, 2025

In my experience, the level of service provided was far below what one would expect from a reputable airline. Specifically, I encountered a significant delay during BA0552 flight, which was exacerbated by a lengthy crew replacement process that took two hours, followed by an additional 1.5 hours for flight attendant replacement.

Throughout this ordeal, I found the staff to be unhelpful and, at times, rude. There was a notable lack of clear and honest communication regarding the reasons for the delay, leaving passengers feeling frustrated and uninformed.

Given these experiences, I regret to say that I no longer view British Airways as a premium airline. Instead, I perceive it to be more akin to a budget carrier in terms of service quality.

I recommend that potential passengers consider using your airline only in exceptional circumstances.

I would like particularly like to highlight the behaviour of Chief Flight Attendants MR. INCOGNITO who was especially rude and dismissive towards to passengers!

I hope you take this feedback into consideration as you strive to improve your services.

British Airways,I arrived at London Heathrow at 6:00am…,1,"I arrived at London Heathrow at 6:00am for a 7:30 boarding, and was turned away at the gate because, as the representative put it ""your flight is in 15 minutes"" and refused to give me a ticket, sent me down the line of customer service reps, some of whom didn't believe I was refused a ticket or to check my bag. After 45 minutes of investigating it was truly too late to get to my flight, and they refused to refund me. I will never use this airline ever again."
British Airways,BA has really lost its shine - don’t bother paying for business class,1,"Travelled from london to Shanghai in business class a few weeks ago. Awful experience. Seats old and worn, entertainment system did not work properly, business class was a reclining seat and a foot stool…felt like a third world operator…"
British Airways,Atrocious customer service for flight cancellation,1,"Probably the worst customer service I’ve ever encountered. Flight from Mexico City cancelled on the 19th Oct. Alternative flight offered was the following night on Mexican Airlines, downgrading me to economy. No sight of the £520 comp they are legally obliged to pay 2 months later. Even worse I paid £790 for an upgrade at the airport and they have even attempted to reimburse that - I had to challenge the payment via Amex which upheld my side. There should be regulatory repercussions for this type of abuse of own customers and non repayment of money owed. I literally don’t understand how they are still in business."
British Airways,One of the worst airlines in the world,1,"One of the worst airlines in the world. Bad service and very bad impolite personnel, especially in Heathrow airport. It is very simple to inform people for an overbooked flight in advance, not rocket science."
British Airways,Don’t Book BA they don’t honour their bookings.,1,"I booked my direct return flight from Dubai to Heathrow back in August. This December rushing home for Christmas I arrived at the airport to discover that British Airways did not have a seat for me on the plane I had paid for. The did put me on a later flight not direct. I am quite frankly disgusted that as a customer I can book and pay for a flight, well in advance, and British airways does not honour its financial contact. After complaining I have had no response!"
British Airways,Utter joke of an airline,1,"Honestly can't be bothered to go into too much detail however I can safely say this company is a joke.

Pointless complaints department. £50 voucher that can only be spend on booking another flight with them is unreal after the two 15 hour flights from hell in less than 6 months that I complained about

Would love to see them go under as a company

Never again"
British Airways,An update and warning for those waiting for compensation and refunds from BA,1,"A further update to the one posted 2 days ago which will likely affect others waiting for compensation and refunds from BA.
Due to a technical fault with the aircraft BA cancelled my flight from LHR to SFO on Dec 20th. This resulted in a 21 hour delay and a journey lasting over 40 hours.
OK, things can go wrong when traveling, that’s just part of experience if you travel often enough. When that happens, what is important is how the airline’s customer services treat you. In this regard I’ve been both shocked and appalled by BA’s response.
After trying 23 times over several days to contact BA Customer Services when I was repeatedly cut off by BA due them having a ‘high call volume’, I finally managed to speak to someone. The response I received was unbelievable.
I asked about the status of my claim and why BA had not communicated anything to me and why BA had automatically closed my claim when I later checked the BA app. I was told “sorry I can’t help you, that department is not operational at the moment”. When I asked when it would be operational and how long it would take to process my claim, I was informed “someone from that department should contact you in the next 2 to 3 months”. Not days, not weeks, months!
When making a booking with BA they require immediate payment, when BA owes the customer money they take 3 months. I cannot even begin to comprehend the degree of contempt BA must have for its customers.
I wish BA would have its landing slots at Heathrow revoked and given to a more competent operator. I’m sure Virgin, Easy Jet or even Ryanair would do a much better job."
British Airways,AVOID,1,"Like many before, there is no point providing detail, as all reviews are ignored.
Apparently my wife's cancer diagnosis and need for immediate chemotherapy are not that important."
British Airways,Terrible service,1,"We were due to fly from Manchester to New York via Heathrow on 27 December. The flight from Manchester was delayed by nearly 4 hours. Given the number of people who were flying on to Newark, BA should have delayed that flight to enable people to transfer. All it needed was a 20 to 30 minute delay to get people through. Of course, that was beyond BA and trying to sort out an onward flight was a very painful experience. BA staff at Heathrow had no idea what to do. As national carriers go, BA must be the worst and we will never travel with them again."
British Airways,Flying back from Schipol in The…,1,"Flying back from Schipol in The Netherlands to London City. I got to the airport a few hours early, went to the BA check-in desk, and asked if I could change to one of the two flights before the one I am booked on, and how much would it cost to switch. Same departure and arrival airports. I was told that couldn't even look into that for me, and I needed to call a BA customer service number. When did airlines decide that you couldn't even discuss the simplest of changes to travel plans in person at the airport? So, I called BA, eventually got through to an agent, explained what I was looking to do and asked for the the price to change. After a few minutes checking he told me that yes, I could switch to the earliest available flight. As he didn't tell me how much I assumed it would be free, or a minimal charge. After another five minutes he had successfully moved me to the earliest flight, then informed me it would cost £139, which is essentially the cost of buying a new ticket. Memo to BA - as part of your customer service training, if there is such a thing, have the agents inform the passenger of any price implications before changing the booking, not after. I said I didn't want to proceed at that cost, he told me he had in the meantime removed me from my original flight, so I would have to re-check in at the airport desk. I went back to the desk, and was told my entire booking had been cancelled, and that I was ""no longer travelling"". After I expressed my disappointment at that particular nugget of information, a supervisor came over and eventually I was back to where I started, with a ticket for my original flight. Only half an hour of my time wasted, with some unnecessary annoyance. I subsequently went to the boarding gate to see if I could be allowed on one of the earlier flights, and was told this was ""not possible"". I am quite sure it is possible, BA just actively hates their customers, and rather than allowing for a simple accommodation, that would inconvenience literally no one, and would mean I got home to my family two hours early, they chose to say no. Well done BA, really well done. Alex Henderson BA member (for now) 40780277"
British Airways,Fdont travel with this shower…,1,Following on from my damning comments I today got a message from Opodo that BA are refunding me for their cancelled flight from Manchester to Heathrow in OCTOBER. they claimed I had used my ticket they claimed I had flown to Venice where I have not been since 1967. I spent hours trying to sort this. Did BA have the decency to apologise for their ridiculous errors OF COURSE NOT I have had no direct contact. If a bank had treated me this way they would have apologised and I estimate would have paid me at least £75 compensation for wasted time and distress. There is more to come from me the matter is still not resolved and their treatment of me and my infirm travelling companion has not been addressed by them on any way except by saying your comments will help us improve in plain English that means go away we are not really going to do anything or accept fault
British Airways,Very disappointing flight,1,"The staff were really arrogant, not friendly and engaging at all, it almost seems as if they just want to get you out of the way feed you and that's it. They did not engage cat all, asked if you wanted o eat and moved on, the male cabin crew that was serving in economy needs customer service training really. I asked for a drink and he said yes he will bring it, waited and waited after 20 minutes asked again from another cabin crew and also was told they will bring it, the flight ended and had still did not get my drink. I was very disappointed. This was my first time flying with British airways have never used him before and I fly at least 5 times a year for both business and lesure. Hope this was a once off and that this was just a bad day for the crew.
The food is really horrible especially after spending £1800 on a flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg i expected better much better for an airlines as big as British airways. The dinner i opened had a look and closed it straight away, went hungry and looked forward to breakfast. Then recieved the breakfast and did the same opened and closed it not good at all. A least i managed to eat the fruit.
The seat space is really uncomfortable, with theatre table beant the trays were sliding off.
Not sure if anyone will call me the after care service normally never happens. My flight number was BA57 on 2nd January 2025.

I am flying tonight again 12th January 2025 BA 56 hope his will be different after trying to upgrade my seat to a window seat and not able to, get to the end and dies not allowed me to make a payment and the seat was available. Eventually when I managed the seat was gone. Really disappointing.

Thank you"
British Airways,Very pleasantly surprised by level of service. A different world compared to RyanAir etc.,5,"I have been very pleasantly surprised with the level of service received during my flights with British Airways.

Complementary water and a snack was included, the staff was friendly and competent and all steps through check-in up to boarding went smooth as butter.
Being used to the terrible customer experience from companies like RyanAir, I was very happy with how my flights with BA went."
British Airways,Tired of breaches of contract,1,"Tired of BA”s terrible customer service. As a business and personal customer I have been forced to spend literally days (in total) in 2024 hanging on phone to fix BA’s mistakes, can’t nominate assistants to do it for me, it is impossible to use BA efficiently fir business (despite spending £20k on a return transatlantic flight); then on August family holiday held to ransom to pay extra £700 on day of travel (BA rep told me this should have been picked up a week ahead); now spent time organising May 2025 family half term holiday, BA cancelled both flights just 48 hours later and are trying to charge a fortune extra to rebook, plus worst still wasting time I simply don’t have. Customer service complaint never answered. Wrote to CEO - no answer. Had it with this arrogant, cowboy outfit. What a dreadful way to treat loyal customers, we should organise a boycott to force them to SPEAK to their customers and sort things out."
British Airways,Rude staff member,1,"I am boarding a flight from Manchester to Chicago
Last check before boarding- where you get passport and boarding pass checked. The men was extremely rude in front my two children!!!
I am disgusted the way he spoke to me. I am carrying 6 passports for 3 of us due to having visa in one and valid passport the other.
He had zero patience
Rude
Just bad reputation for your name!!
I couldnt get his name. I didnt want to carry on the tone he had in front my children !!"
British Airways,British Airways - Disgraceful National airline!,1,"Arrived at Heathrow in good time for flight BA57 to Johannesburg on 1 Jan 25. All checked in and waiting in Departure Area C63 - 1 HOUR before departure, I hear fellow passengers say the flight is CANCELLED! No explanation and no e-mail notification. Queue for Transport/Travel vouchers a mile long. Fortunately for me my daughter travelled back to LHR pick me up again.

PLEASE CLARIFY Surely complete and thorough check on all planes done LONG before departure? If so, why is 'technical issue' only found 1 hour before departure when hundreds of passenger have been inconvenienced with travel, luggage, Passport/Security checks, terminal changes and three hours wasted and only then do BA discover a 'technical issue'!!??

Would maybe believe this if not for fact that in January, 2024 on BA flight to SA - 4 hour delay sitting in LHR. Return from SA to London BA56 due to depart Monday 22 April - delayed - guess why - technical issues. Eventually got flight on 24th April!! Put in claim for this delay via Skycops and now, some 9 MONTHS later, they advise that although BA agree to the claim, HAVE NOT yet paid out. Is this true and, if so, why not? Obviously supporting national airline not a very good idea. The continued excuse of 'last minute technical issues' is wearing very thin! Ever since COVID BA has become an absolute disaster airline"
British Airways,Overbooked and involuntarily canceled…,1,"Overbooked and involuntarily canceled when flying to grandmother funeral. No refund, no rebooking and no staff at Zagreb airport, only contractors that said it was canceled. Was on hold with BA for over 2 hours and 12 minutes with nobody picking up. We had to rebook for $3108 and submitted a complaint thinking similar to other overbooking with other airlines we would be refunded. They pointed out in T&Cs they are only obligated to refund 100 GBP per ticket for inconveniences. Basically, lost $1559 ticket plus another $3108 ticket purchased and found out they resold/oversold our ticket for 2999 GBP. I am upset my grandmother's death was an inconvenience to your company and that the agent who wrote the response to our claim was annoyed that BA only made $1559 plus 2999 GBP on the seat that was probably sold to some desperate or rich person that didn't have a funeral to go to an likely a nice holiday, who knows. I feel if you buy a ticket, you buy a ticket. Should I be stupid enough to not show, BA is still compensated for the seat because it was paid for. It is a poor excuse to say you overbook to be efficient. Other airlines rebooked or refunded, yours did not. You are hurting people financially and emotionally when they are going through a difficult time with travel and all at the expense of profit."
British Airways,Baby not allowed in a lounge with Gold Card!,1,"While traveling with a 3 year old baby and my husband, the baby was not allowed into the lounge with my husband’s Gold card, as you can only bring one guest (I was plus 1). They said that the baby counts as another guest and can not enter! Ridiculous! It never happened with Emirates/ Qatar or any other airlines, so was a bit of the shock as we came earlier to feed the baby in the lounge.

The staff on board didn’t help to lift the baby stroller to the hand luggage section explaining that they are not allowed to touch the bags, which is a lie. Again ALL other airlines staff were helping when I was traveling with a baby, even EasyJet!

During the flight (in Premium Economy!) I was pushing the button to call for assistance (remove the food tray to go to the toilet with my baby) NO ONE CAME WITHIN 20 minutes (!!!). What if I felt sick or had an emergency??

BA is probably the worst airline I have ever traveled with, the service is below the lowest standards and now with the new rewards system it doesn’t make sense to use it at all.

Expensive and very bad service!"
British Airways,Extremely disappointing experience,1,Another very poor experience here. Five hour flight delay owing to fog at LGW. Little to no information or support during delay (at GVA).
British Airways,"Not the best, not even in top 10.",2,"Plane was fine albeit a broken toilet in economy class that caused some issues as would not let passengers use first class toilets.

The problem with BA is the actual service. To be offered 1 drink on a 12 hour flight is a joke. Cabin care tucked themselves away nicely in the back and drew the curtains for most of the flight. Staff uniforms are tacky and poor fitting. I really think BA needs to learn from Qatar and Emirates as BA is honestly years behind."
British Airways,Poor customer service,1,"It was our first time traveling with BA, should also be the last one.

We experienced two flight cancellations in 2 consecutive days, both of which were communicated with short notice and without any reasons provided at the time. At last, we were rebooked to the Air France with connecting flight. It was so inconvenience for our family of 6.

Our insurance claim has been rejected on the basis of ""adverse weather conditions,"" yet I have repeatedly requested formal written proof of the two flight cancellations to address this matter, and after four months, I still have not received a response. This prolonged delay is unacceptable and has caused significant inconvenience and wasted time."
British Airways,Don't bother paying for business class,1,"I booked a full fare business class return to Port of Spain in Trinidad in mid Nov 2024. Booking reference: RABUNE

As others have reported the cabin is now looking quite shabby with the entertainment sound only working intermittently.

Flights were on time and the menu was great.

My main disappointment was the lack of business class lounge at Port of Spain. The ""VIP Lounge"" was closed for refurbishment. Fair enough, but I was expecting some compensation for this lack of expected service.

I was give a USD28 voucher to use at the public ""Heroes Bar"". As the sports bar was full I was not allowed in. I was offered a take away meal and drink (to the value of USD28 - basically a burger meal and drink) but I declined as there were no tables free to eat at. Also, there were no power sockets or private areas to sit and work.

I complained to BA on my return about the inconvenience and discomfort, and after 6 weeks my case has been closed with no offer of compensation for the lower than expected service level.

Lesson learned: Don't expect all the high level service ""extras"" from BA. BA only seem to compensate for those legally required (e.g. for delays or cancellations within their control).

BA's 6 week delay in replying is perhaps understandable after reading all the other reviews on Trustpilot. Oh, how the mighty have fallen."
British Airways,"LYING, CHEATING, RATS",1,"Absolutely shocking levels of customers service. Rude staff who lie at every opportunity.

I booked a flight from Heathrow to Dubai, I made the booking at the time using 2 different payment cards therefore the trip was split into 2 bookings by call centre staff. Closer to the time, I had the option to upgrade cabin, I called straight away to upgrade all 4 seats at the same time as the 2 bookings weren’t showing in my app. The guy I spoke to sounded helpful and quoted the price for all 4 tickets, I agreed and was told that it would need to be processed in 2 different payments as it was 2 seperate bookings, I had no issue with that and agreed. The payment was taken for my son’s seats and then immediately after was told that myself and my wife’s tickets would be exponentially more expensive now as someone else has taken the offer.

After a lot of back and forth and false promises, the call was ‘listened to’ and no concluded that was not in fact what had happened. I cannot speak to any escalations team nor have a copy of the recording.

LYING, CHEATING SCUM BAGS"
British Airways,Adding insult to incompetence!,1,"When I made the booking, I reluctantly chose BA as they had the latest return flight on the Sunday of a weekend away.
I found out from the airport website that my flight had been cancelled.
No chance of getting hold of anyone at BA so I had to buy a new flight with EasyJet. After I had done that, BA offered me a Monday flight.
When I went to claim compensation from BA, they said it was the weather that had affected flights. As theirs was the only flight cancelled that day, the arrogance of BA just adds to its poor reputation."
British Airways,Poor customer service,1,"I spent a considerable amount of time on the phone attempting to resolve a booking for my family holiday. Over the course of four separate occasions, I had to speak with four different members of staff, each time enduring a queue of over 40 minutes.

What I found particularly frustrating was that each representative provided entirely different costs and calculations, despite being given the same points and voucher information.

Moreover, I found the tone and attitude of the staff to be unacceptably arrogant, even though I made every effort to remain polite throughout the interactions.

In contrast, when I contacted Virgin Atlantic, I was thoroughly impressed with how professionally and efficiently they handled my calls. Their customer service was exemplary, and their offerings were notably more competitive compared to British Airways."
British Airways,If you don't buy your seat on BA…,1,"If you don't buy your seat on BA flights they stick you in the worse possible seat on allocation, rear no windows, no leg room. I have flown BA many times, and each time it gets worse. No food, no comfort, no point. Plus they now seem to believe that cabin bags must be checked in, even when tiny. Stop treating your passengers like cattle."
British Airways,My Sister & Brother-in-law travelled…,1,"My Sister & Brother-in-law travelled back without as much as a CHOCOLATE to celebrate New Year's Eve.

British Airways,Misleading prices,1,"The booking price shown is 991 JOD but they booked 1016 JOD from the credit card, my cc is in the same currency shown in the offer. The price is misleading and there are hidden fees."
British Airways,"Not ""One World"" at all",1,"Beware that if you purchase a ticket on American Airlines even though they are part of the ""One World Alliance"" you will not get the same benefits on British Airways. As a platinum member of American Airlines I booked my flight directly on American's website, used an American Airlines Credit Card to pay for the ticket -this should have entitled me to 1 free checked bag person. I was given British Airways on my return flight without any advance notice that it would mean I would have to pay a 45BP per bag fee on the flight. (4 people traveling) The result was a total of over $200 more for my return flight. Contacting AA on my return was of no help--they directed me to BA and said they would not negotiate on my behalf. After back and forth they did eventually give me some additional miles but still said I should contact BA directly for any refund. The BA customer service rep on the phone was as combative and rude as the person who checked us in in London and no refund. They said I had purchased a fair with ""no baggage""-news to me! Bottom line don't expect the ""One World"" to be one world."
British Airways,I will never fly BA again,1,"I will never fly BA again.
We were so badly looked after, holiday ruined by them losing our bags and never accepted responsibility or gave compensation."
British Airways,Not a good company,1,"Not a good company, I will definitely not fly on their flights again. The customer service at Heathrow Airport is not really good. They are very rude and do not want to help even if it is a simple matter or a big problem. Sometimes they even refuse to talk and tell you to go there. I do not have a solution for you"
British Airways,"Every time I fly with BA, I think it can't get worse",1,"BA are utterly hopeless. There is an issue with every single interaction with them. This time we were due on a flight to the UK from Nice at 9am. The day before we checked in and went to bed early as we needed to leave our house at 5am. By chance my wife got up in the night and saw that our flight was cancelled and we were being re-routed via Frankfurt on a flight leaving Nice at 7am so we needed to leave at 3am. Not only did the flight leave two hours earlier, it arrived over an hour later so in effect our journey time was doubled. I have subsequently asked BA five times why we weren't offered a flight from Marseilles. There was one available at the same time as the cancelled Nice flight so it would have made no difference to our day. BA have steadfastly refused to answer but I know the reason. If your departure airport is changed, the level of compensation required is slightly higher than if the alternative flight is at a different time from the same airport. This is penny pinching at an extraordinary level particularly as I am a lifetime Gold card holder. This company is an utter disgrace"
British Airways,Worst boarding experience ever in malaga( kid included),1,"The boarding in Málaga was one of the worst ever made. We were with one child queuing. The queues were badly indicated with only 2/3 desks opened. So we went to the left one which was opened. Once arrived ( after 45 minutes of queueing with a kid) we were blamed that it was for VIP customer I had to read the board.... Which was wrongly indicated as opened and that I had to insist to make them change. The board attendant told us to make again the queue, and that we were not making the queue so long. I never was considered like that. Moreover with a 2 years old kid that you try to manage away to avoid to bother everyone. I did not expect that paying the price of a national company and treated worst than a low cost.
Today I am in Toulouse: again only 2/3desks opened and we had to queue for 1 hour.
I don't recommend this company due to the lack of customer consideration and all the economies made at the boarding"
British Airways,Unfriendly food disgusting hardly any…,1,Unfriendly food disgusting hardly any drinks offered on long haul
British Airways,Lost Luggage for 21 Days (entire trip) + Struggling with Reimbursement,1,"I am absolutely frustrated and disappointed with British Airways. During my recent trip, my luggage was delayed for the entire 21 days, despite having an Airtag in it to track its location. I was able to recover it only on my way back during my connection in London. The lack of responsibility and urgency from British Airways to resolve the issue was shocking.

The customer support was incredibly poor throughout the entire ordeal. I had to deal with multiple agents who could not provide any real solutions. To make matters worse, after I submitted a claim and attached all my expenses (which I incurred due to the delayed luggage), the case was closed without any resolution. I had to reopen the claim myself, and now, after 5 more days of waiting, I’m still no closer to any compensation or resolution.

When I attempted to chat with customer support, I was told they could not access claims because they were handled by the ""Customer Relations"" team, which I cannot contact directly. The only option I have is to fill out a new form. It feels like British Airways is deliberately making it as difficult as possible for customers to get answers, much less fair compensation.

This has been one of the most frustrating experiences I’ve ever had with an airline. The lack of communication, support, and accountability is unacceptable. I strongly advise others to be cautious when choosing British Airways, as this experience has been far below the standards I would expect from a major airline."
British Airways,Unprofessional,1,"My Honest Reviews are based on exactly what happened not how I felt or my opinion

Flying from England to Brisbane AU (CHARGER INPUT DIDNT WORK)

Once landed in sydney for my connecting flight, I was informed i'm not on it and to find the british airways desk. (THEY DIRECTED ME TO A LOCTION WHAT WAS NOT IT THEN 2 OTHER STAFF DIRECTED ME TO 2 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHAT WAS NOT IT.)
The Help desk took me to the right location to then see its actually closed as a normal procedure every day and open in the next 5hours.

The help desk the walked me back to the flight I was meant to be on to Brisbane on all the way to the orginal terminal I was already at, to say I have to board it before it leaves as my ticket shows it has to be this flight. They did a longer search to find out i am meant to be on it but (BRITISH AIRWAYS DIDNT INFORM JETSTAR) so they let me on a later flight instead of my orignal one.

I contacted british airways during my holiday in australia over email, to then recieve £50 voucher (WHAT WAS VALID FOR 1 DAY WHAT WAS NOT MY RETURN FLIGHT DAY)
I emailed back asking why its not dated for my return as i'm not flying anywhere for this date you gave the voucher for...Up to today i'm still waiting for a email reply.

Picture Proof attcahed of the email.

During that covid December when all flights got canceled, I was creditded the value of the flight to be used up to September, It was done through a 3rd party company (THAT TOOK THEIR TIME TO GET A EVOUCHER FROM THE AIRLINE TO GIVE TO ME, BRITISH AWAYS DIDNT WANT TO ACT ON IT WHEN I CONTACTED THEM WITH THE RIGHT DETAILS, THEY WANTED TO HEAR IT FROM THE 3RD PARTY COMPANY FIRST)

Then it was to late, (I LOST OUT ON £470)."
British Airways,Transfer delays from Heathrow to local…,1,"Transfer delays from Heathrow to local flight. The flight was a little late landing at Heathrow from Zurich but the taxi- ing and disembarking took a very long time over an hour and half, and although no flight delay it was over 3 hours before disembarking and then having to join and obscenely long queue to have to go through security for a second time! None of the staff were helpful and we missed the flight to Newcastle by three minutes but our luggage did not! B.A did pay for our train ride back and we just made it on time after spending hours queuing with other passengers who had missed connections, and getting out through security to exit the airport. Finally got home 9 hours later than original time given. We went to the airport at 10pm no staff and no luggage so had to fill in a lost luggage form. The luggage arrived a week or so later. We were offered no compensation because B.A stated Quote - "" Your flight was not delayed"" I thought that the whole transfer process was appalling, stressful, no information about flight boarding times given while we were in the long queues to re do the security already done in Zurich and no help from staff who were shouting at passengers telling them it was their fault if they missed flights for not packing bags right. Ok I accept security separate to B.A . But why no B.A staff there to fast track passengers on connecting flights. I will never us this service again, I went with KLM the next time and it was far better."
British Airways,Worst than Bucket Airlines,1,"Booking Ref:- PR9ZSX
What a bunch of J arthurs. Booked a holiday for my family of 9!! AI to Antalya. They changed the timings.. I arrive at destination nearly midnight instead of 2 in the afternoon. Depart from Antalya at 9:00 pm instead of 2 pm. Have young children, hence chose earlier times. Had to call them 4 times !! as the numbers were incorrect ;-( after hanging on for over 15 mins each time. This was the number on my email GB +44 (0) 344 493 0787 but was eventually asked to call 0344 493 0747. Seriously worst than 3rd world service. So I asked what do i do from 12:00 pm on the day of the check out till 7 pm in the evening especially with the young children... their reply... take it up with the hotel... FFS, I booked with you... so you ensure there is late checkout. NO CAN DO. Been loyal for a long while, time to change."
British Airways,"Incompetent service, & fail to respond to written complaint",1,"Back in Summer 2024, we booked two BA return flights to Istanbul for May 2025; In December we received an email from BA saying our return flight on 13/05/25 (BA603) had been cancelled and we were offered a flight 24 hours later.

This was no use to us - due to pre-booked accommodation and annual leave dates. I called BA who told me there were no other flights available on 13/05 from Istanbul to Heathrow; I was told there were no BA flights at all on that day. I therefore cancelled the entire booking.

I have since discovered the BA representative who told me there were no alternative flights available was incorrect. There are THREE BA flights on 13/05/25. One leaves just thirty minutes later than our original flight time. Re-booking this new flight would cost significantly more than I originally paid.

I therefore called customer services, and asked that my booking be reinstated, on the new flight, at the original price. The representative told me that they could not assist me because my booking was cancelled. However - I only cancelled the entire booking due to the false information I was given in BA's cancellation email, and in the subsequent phone call with BA.
BA customer services advised me to raise a written complaint via their website. I did this on 5/12/24, a month ago. I received an online acknowledgement (with a reference number) which said that my complaint would be investigated thoroughly and someone would be back in touch with me as soon as possible.
I never heard another thing. So I have had to book flights with an alternative carrier, and I have learned the hard way that BA is no longer 'the airline of choice'.
I won't trust them in future - they don't seem to know what they are doing and can't even be bothered to respond to a written complaint."

British Airways,The crew helped me get off the plane quickly,5,"When travelling back from Heathrow to Billund I received a message from my brother right after boarding the plane. My mother, who had been admitted to hospital a few days earlier, had taken a turn for the worse.
I was seated in a window seat in the middle of the plane and knew it would take time to get off. I asked the crew if I possible could buy an upgrade to be seated in the front. That however was no longer possible.
When I told them about my situation, they said not to worry - they would help me get to the front just before landing.
So when we approached Billund I was moved to a seat in business class and they took my carry-on luggage as well.
I was able to get off the plane as the very first passenger.
My son was waiting for me and I got to the hospital in time to say goodbye to my mother, when she still was conscious. She died the following night.
Thank you to a compassionate crew!"

British Airways,Terrible service / terrible app,1,Terrible service / terrible app : every single time I fly with them their asking me to enter my passport information .. Even Ryan Air is capable of saving passport information.. Just another BA inefficiency
British Airways,British Airways should leave the service industry,1,"We had a flight from Newcastle -> London -> Delhi with everything arranged, web checkin done and we booked good seats.
Due to the first flight delay, we did not make the second flight. We were given a flight 7 hours later with separate middle seats, far apart from each other but this had a knock on effect of missing our hotel stay and car and driver that had been arranged in India.
I was going to India for my wedding and missed my wedding dress fitting appointment also.
We were very upset and thought we would get a cup of tea as we both had headaches from the waiting and commotion but the queue at the cafe was so long that we decided to go to the BA lounge to sit down. I was feeling very dizzy and nauseated. My partner said to the receptionist called Av that if he could get the manager while we settle down.
Av asked us for the tickets and then mocked us seeing the ‘economy class’ which was given to us as the only option by BA. I can’t express my disgust at the way he smirked and let out a laugh seeing the tickets. When I confronted him, he asked me for further details which I did provide and added the issues I was facing due to a pounding headache to which his response was “are you going to answer me straight forward or not?”. He threatened to take us off the flight several times if we didn’t move.
We both collapsed on the floor near the door due to being drained of all this and bad head ache.
The manager Caroline Sawyer came and announced straight away that we should get up and leave ignoring our condition. They didn’t ask us once about our health, they didn’t care about spoiling my onward wedding plans which had to be all rearranged, they didn’t care at all about spoiling my start of the beautiful journey for my destination wedding.
Infact she threatened us to call the police and have us removed from the flight again and report at the gate to be monitored.
We left and went for a tea and sandwich. They had given us a voucher of £10 each. The cost of two tea and one sandwich and two packets of crips came to £20.95.
Although we were going to wait 7hours, they didn’t provide us water or any other comfort.
Because they only have a relationship with virgin Atlantic and air Canada. They would not put us on an afternoon flight on air India even though it was available.
I wish I had not made this mistake of booking BA for my big day plan.
It’s humiliating and embarrassing even to talk to them. They talk to you as if they are God and we are peasants. I think it’s safe to say we had an experience of being with corporate bullies and in easier terms a dictatorship.
Their threats were appalling. Their treatment towards a sick person was deplorable. Their poor attitude added to my stress and caused me more dizziness.
They should leave the service industry."
British Airways,Poor standards. Avoid it like a plaque,1,"Flight no: BA407
From Cairo to London.
Staff crew: (Taylor)
Onboard staff manager: (Stephanie).

Absolutely ridiculous service in every way!! Someone must take action; this cannot continue. The staff member ""Taylor"" refused to adjust my wife's food and forced her to eat it or leave it, despite her informing him, ""I am diabetic,"" which meant she needed to eat something appropriate. He simply responded, ""Me too,"" in a mocking tone and grew adamant about it. So I decided to get up and go try to talk with his colleagues in the back of the plane, but I discovered him there, and he jumped in and started mouthing F language!

I got into an argument with him, and I started shaking from the shock of this behaviour. It was so unprofessional and so disrespectful and so disgusting to get this level of low-grade service on an aeroplane; it’s out of this world, literally. However, it happens only in BA airlines because clearly this is a matter of staff management and service quality. Eventually, I filed an official complaint onboard with the crew manager, “Stephanie,” who investigated this incident with her staff crew, and she got back to me with a shameful apology and that she has registered my complaint; however, I told her that the way we were treated on this flight and the stressful situation my wife and I were put through, no verbal apology could ever make it up. To this effect, I believe a disciplinary action against this staff and a management action by BA to investigate and prevent this behaviour from occurring again is a must. Until then, Avoid this airline at all costs."
British Airways,Insect Infestation On Board / 7 months…,1,"Insect Infestation On Board / 7 months - No resolution
July 2024
Please note the potentially dangerous health and safety issue we experienced this summer. Flight BA 119 on 8th July from LHR to BLR was unsanitary and dangerous.

After take off, half an hour later my wife had multiple insect bites . She reported to the Air hostess Cristina. Her arm suffered major inflammation - I can attach a photo if customers wish to PM me. The area was clearly severely infested. No action taken.

After two hours my son who was sitting next to her had his whole back inflamed with severe red rashes and excessive itching from the bug bites on the seat. Cristina took several photos, which BA have not released to me. She gave them anti histamines and after few hours gave more antihistamines (dosage authorised by the captain / doctor?). The infestation was now clearly pervasive.

After several hours (!!!) she finally moved my son to an aisle seat in premium economy and moved my wife into in a middle seat away from him and which was rather uncomfortable. My wife experienced breathing issues , which means this represented a serious threat to my and my family's safety as she was traveling with 2 minors alone.

These were all recorded by BA and Cristina assured that the complaint would be lodged and someone from BA would contact. On return flight 30 Aug BA118, no BA staff had any record of the incident. As of now, radio silence and no resolution.

I am writing this because the case is still open and BA has appointed an external legal company, who are clearly playing a waiting game. Noone has responded to my last 3 months of emails. The external lawyer BA has appointed is an expert, ""represents airlines in respect of various types of claims, including personal injury, hull damage, subrogation, discrimination, denied boarding and baggage claims, and...also advises on regulatory issues in the aviation industry"", so is an expert. I cannot afford the $$$$ against such an expert, but under disclosure, I wonder whether we would find emails that BA is asking him to delay / deprioritise.

BA service standards - from economy to business class - are becoming a national disgrace."
British Airways,I will never fly with British Airways again. They must have the worst customer service of any company anywhere!,1,This is the worst flying experience I have ever had. Following a weekend away - arrived at the airport 3 hours before our flight home from Edinburgh. Was told the flight back to London at lunchtime was full. We waited at the gate while they boarded everyone else. There is no one from BA at Edinburgh airport. Everything is contracted through Menzies. They told us that they would book us onto the next slight at 7.45 that night. They sent us to the lounge. While in the lounge we phoned a BA call centre who told us that we had been removed from the flight as that one was now full. No one told us. No one from BA would help us. No one from Menzies would help us. We stood next to the boarding desk while they boarded the 7.45 flight and were not allowed on as it was full. We spent nearly 10 hours at the airport before finally being put on a flight to a different airport late that night. The worst part - other than 9 hours at the airport - with no one from BA able to speak to us - was that since returning - you cannot speak to anyone in customer services - you call an international call centre - who say that you are unable to talk directly to customer services. We are now phoning this call centre every few days as know that under European law we are entitled to compensation - but they are making it impossible to claim. I cannot believe that British Airways is so utterly awful. I will never fly with them again ever!
British Airways,Fly ABBA,1,"Fly ABBA - Anyone But BA - next time.
I booked flights for my wife and I to fly for a week's holiday. Or so i had thought. The confirmation email had the correct flight details (dates, times, airports). But no mention of passenger names.

On randomly logging into BA to see if an upgrade was possible at a sensible price per their advert email (answer, no its not), I was horrified to find that the booking had myself and someone other than my wife travelling; I had once made a booking that included this other person, about 7 years ago, and I have no idea why this name had arrived on the booking - certainly not deliberately selected at any time.

BA policy is that they can make name changes on the ticket only if picked up in the first 24 hours after booking. The flight was not refundable and they had no flexibility around changing the obvious error, forcing me to buy a new ticket. They seriously lack customer service. Just as well I spotted this before checking in a day before the flight! We refused to accept their offer to cancel the unwanted flight (with zero refund) as they would only be able to sell it again. I would have been relatively content if they charged a reasonable fee for the name change, but having to write off the whole cost was fairly outrageous in my view - for what was an obvious error. Instead, we will retain empty seat and have some more space for ourselves! Equivalent to Business Class - almost!"
British Airways,British Airways happy to 'steal' from customers! Appalling treatment!,1,"I am appalled at the despicable way in which British Airways have behaved! I am absolutely angry, upset, frustrated and fed up with the seeming impossibility and inability of BA staff to arrange for me to book a seat for a cello alongside a passenger! They have effectively stolen £76 from me and are refusing to refund this! I have been waiting to be contacted by a manager, since mid- November and have now given up, hence posting this review!
BA's procedure for booking a cello seat is TOTALLY RIDICULOUS and near impossible:
On 13th November 2024 I called BA to book a seat for my son and a seat for his cello, to travel from UK to Austria. I have booked seats twice before with BA and know from these experiences that rather than simply booking two seats online (as with any other airline he has travelled with!) that BA require that a cello seat has to be booked separately to the passenger seat, via a phone call.
When I called to book a seat for the cello, I was first told I could simply book 2 seats via the BA website. I was very surprised and asked the staff member if this was correct. I was told this was the case, and felt relieved that BA must have changed their rules. However I decided to check...... I googled BA’s website and discovered that this information was in fact incorrect. When I mentioned this, the staff member first disagreed...and then checked.. and told me that I did in fact need to book the cello seat on the phone!! It was very surprising that this person did not know the rules and had I not known this from previous experience, I would have bought an incorrect ticket which apparently would not have been accepted at the airport!
I was then told I needed to book a seat for my son first, and that once I had a reference number, to call back to arrange for a seat for the cello. I did this and I used a BA voucher to pay for the flight for my son: Booking JRQEJZ.
When I called back to ask for the additional seat, I was told that a form had to first be submitted to apply for the seat. I made it very clear that we definitely needed a seat for the cello as it was not allowed legally, for this cello to be placed in the hold. The staff member then said they had submitted the form and that I would be contacted by email a day or two later, and should at that point call back to pay for the seat.
Two days later, on 15th Nov I received and email asking me to contact BA about my booking. I called back only to be told that the form had somehow not been properly submitted and needed to be submitted again, I was again told to call back 24 to 48 hours later. I called again on 16th and was told there was still no decision about the cello seat and that I should call again in 24-72 hours. My son was due to fly in LESS than 72 hours and this felt like an impossible situation!!!!
The staff members that I spoke to did not seem at all sympathetic, caring, or even concerned that I had spent four days, not to mention many, many hours of being on hold, that I was getting nowhere and still did not know if the seat would be granted or not!! Their entire attitude was as if they didn’t care at all about their customers!!
Again, I called back a day later – 17th Nov in the evening and at that point was told that my son could not have a seat for the cello but would have to book it into the hold, despite me having expressly stated that this was not safe for an old cello and also was not legally allowed for his instrument to go in the hold!!! I stated that I knew it was possible to take the cello on a seat, as we had done this on two previous occasions without problem, however, I was simply repeatedly told that cellos cannot go on seats and must go into the hold. If this is the case, why was I not told this? It makes no sense, as on BA’s website it states:
“Your cello can travel next to you in the cabin in an additional seat. You’ll need to buy this seat specifically for your cello when you book your flight, or at least 48 hours before you travel, subject to availability.
At this point, I had only a few hours to find a new flight for my son and his cello, in order that he could return on 18th. I was also in the position of having purchased a seat for my son for £76, which I ONLY purchased because I was told by BA staff that in order to apply for a cello seat, I HAD TO 1ST PURCHASE A SEAT and obtain a booking reference number!!! I would never have purchased this seat if I had known from the start that they were to refuse the cello!!! When I asked for this cost to be refunded I was repeatedly told that this was not possible! I consider this akin to stealing this money from me!! I then spoke with Swalia, a manager who said she would look into this for me and contact me. I am still waiting and have heard nothing. I am beyond upset and consider that BA not only do not care about their customers, but are happy to steal from them!
They obviously do not want to have musicians travel with them.
Avoid at all costs!"
British Airways,BA has untrained agents,1,"BA has untrained agents, who gives inadequate information when a person is trying to change flight due to bereavement. I asked him(Shivam) if there was anything I could submit relating to bereavement, he said only death certificate and that only would $25 service fee no other documents would work, it was impossible for me to submit death certificate in when dad passed away about 4 hrs ago.I had to change ticket quickly,I couldn’t wait for death certificate if only $25 was going to be waived. I changed my ticket for next day, Charged me the change fee while with my husband credit card wouldn’t work on their end so he said he will call me back in 30 minutes. The call came but it was another agent, he said we can submit a letter stating father’s death from the doctor or nursing home he was in, we submitted that via email, he waived the change fee, when I asked why is it that it don’t apply to me, he said nothing could be done, since it already paid. I said it was your agents fault initially giving me wrong information. I claimed for my refund detailing everything as above. Email came as a standard statement normally everyone has to pay the fare difference. Completely ignoring my issue, no refund was given. Had to talk so many agent , never gives a clear answer. Think twice before booking with BA. Never helpful to-customers in their distress moment. Had travel with BA several time but this was very stressful experience. I would think twice before traveling with BA.

British Airways,A NIGHTMARE FOR OUR FAMILY!!!,1,"Our recent experience with British Airways was beyond disappointing—it was infuriating, exhausting, and completely unacceptable. We were traveling as a family of six, including an 8-year-old child, with 10 pieces of luggage, and a daughter with a health condition that made this ordeal even harder to endure. What was supposed to be a straightforward journey from Prague to Los Angeles turned into a multi-day disaster.

First, our flight from Prague to London was delayed by 10 hours, causing us to miss our connecting flight to Los Angeles. Instead of finding a reasonable solution, British Airways rescheduled us with a 48-hour layover in London. We were forced to endure an unnecessary two-day stay, and what made it worse was the complete lack of empathy or effort from the airline staff at Heathrow. Frankly, they did not care about our situation, offered no genuine assistance, and left us feeling abandoned in an already stressful situation. There wasn't even a live agent available at the airport and we had to wait in a long line to call and talk to someone. It is important to mention that there were earlier flights available that were leaving with empty seats in higher class cabins, but the airline refused to give us those seats.

When we were finally sent to an airport hotel, things didn’t improve. After traveling for hours with a child, we arrived only to find that our room wasn’t ready for multiple hours, forcing us to sit in the lobby, hungry, tired, and with nowhere to rest or work. To make matters worse, we were all missing work and had to keep up with remote responsibilities in a completely unsuitable environment. Despite our repeated requests for help, no one at the hotel or British Airways was willing to assist us, leaving us feeling ignored and helpless. The hotel vouchers they gave us were for only 1 night and whem we told them that our flight is 2 days after, they said that we need to go back to the airport the next day to get new vouchers and there is no guarantee that it will be the same hotel...

On top of everything, the hotel was over an hour’s drive from the city center, meaning we couldn’t even make the best of this awful layover by exploring the city. Instead, we were stuck far from everything, with no options other than waiting around miserably until our next flight.

British Airways showed zero regard for our time, comfort, or well-being, and this experience was nothing short of a nightmare for our entire family. It’s one thing to encounter delays, but the lack of basic customer service and accountability we faced is completely inexcusable. I would strongly advise anyone considering flying with British Airways to think twice—no one deserves to go through what we did.

We expect a formal response and adequate compensation for the enormous inconvenience and distress caused by this ordeal. Anything less would only add to the disappointment we already feel."

The person assisting me without being blatantly rude, it was obvious, she couldn't care less and was a bit abrupt. Defying my expectations, she called back to provide an alternative booking number that did not work either. At that point, she kind of gave up, saying ""that's all I have"". When I pushed back, she promised to look into it and get back to me.

Fast forward few hours, I accepted she wouldn't call back and decided to contact Walt Disney Travel Company directly, more in hope than expectation, given that I did not book with them. A lovely and helpful customer representative listened to all the details but couldn't resolve the issue immediately given that she couldn't find the booking details provided by BA. She logged the issue and asked me to check the Disney website within 24 hours. When I checked, to my surprise, my booking finally appeared with a completely different number than then one I was provided with from BA.

To make a long story short, BA has a lot learn about customer service from companies such as Disney. Dealing with their moody, unhelpful and full of attitude customer service staff is a disappointing experience!"

British Airways,"""British Airways' Sneaky System Switch: Old Claims Closed Without Notice, New System Implemented December 23-25, 2024 - One Year of Frustration, Delay, Lack of Communication, and Unnecessary Stress.”",1,"My Trip Details:

February 20, 2024 - March 11, 2024

# Formal Complaint Against British Airways

I've been waiting almost a year for a resolution to my issue with British Airways, and I'm appalled at the lack of communication and accountability.

# Initial Incident

My first flight with British Airways was a disaster. I paid for a window seat, but someone else was sitting in it. I had to confront the passenger, and the stewardess didn't intervene. To make matters worse, my brand-new luggage was damaged.

# Poor Communication and Lack of Accountability

I've been calling British Airways every month, and each time, I'm told that my case is under investigation. However, I've never received any formal updates or communication. I've been given conflicting information, and it seems like no one is taking responsibility for resolving my issue.

# Disturbing Discovery

I recently learned that British Airways changed their system, and my case was transferred to a new system without my knowledge. I was told that I need to resubmit my claim, which is unacceptable.

# Additional Incidents and Traumatic Experiences

The incidents I've mentioned so far are only a few examples of the appalling treatment I've received from British Airways and their partners. There are many more, and I'd like to share one particularly disturbing experience that occurred on March 11, 2024, at Casablanca Airport.

As I was preparing to board my connecting flight, I was approached by a porter who offered to assist me. I gratefully accepted, but soon realized that he had an ulterior motive. He took me to an elevator and demanded money aggressively. When I refused, he became hostile and took possession of my carry-on luggage.

I was shocked and terrified, especially since I was traveling alone in a foreign country where I didn't speak the language. I managed to take a photo of the porter as evidence and eventually retrieved my luggage. However, the experience left me traumatized, and I've been experiencing anxiety daily since then.

I've reported this incident to my doctor and have been seeking treatment for my anxiety. I hold British Airways responsible for this traumatic experience, as they failed to ensure my safety and well-being during my travels.

# Final Ultimatum and Intent to Pursue Small Claims Court

I'm putting British Airways on formal notice that I'm prepared to take legal action if my case isn't resolved immediately. Despite my patience and numerous follow-ups over the past year, I've been met with empty promises, conflicting information, and a blatant lack of communication.

The fact that British Airways has ignored my complaints and failed to take meaningful action is unacceptable. I've been patient, but my patience has worn thin. I'm appalled by the sheer volume of complaints against British Airways, and I'm determined to take action to hold them accountable.

If I don't receive a satisfactory response by January 12, 2025, I will initiate proceedings in Small Claims Court. I'm confident that the evidence and documentation I've gathered will support my claim."

Now we can start with the jokes and punch lines. first, we open the suitcase to find the loose medicine and unfrozen ice bags and no freezer. We then see the note from British air saying they removed the freezer for violating policy, and that we should contact their partner smartcarte if we want it back. I write to the email address provided to inquire how to get freezer when I return to lhr next week, and the email address turns out to be invalid. Not to be detoured, I find the lhr lost and found website and log in a claim there directly to coordinate pick up. Within minutes of submission, I get an agent on the phone from lost and found explaining that it will take 2 to 3 weeks for someone to get to my claim, but that they can jump on it right now for only $37. I explain the freezer is for medicine and that I have a big problem, and they advised me again that for just $37 they can take care of me. I didn’t get to the more than 100 plus euro train rebooking and extra taxi fees to get to destination, the 2 days I just lost trying to get my bag, or the fact that I did not see anything on BA restricted list that would have caused them to pull freezer that I have flown with many times on other airlines without incident. HORRIBLE experience and customer service, and impossible to get help. Terrible, terrible experience and it is still going on….i think I am actually starting to hate this company."
British Airways,Shit,1,"Shit, not organised at all. Expect to waste hours in the airport"
British Airways,DO NOT FLY BA IF YOU CAN AVOID IT,1,"I travelled Heathrow to San Diego in August 2024. Having had my 2nd hip replacement in January 24 I opted to pay to upgrade to premium economy, to ensure I was comfortable.
However on my return leg, having checked in online and being issued with a printed boarding pass at check-in, I was called to the desk at the gate, about 15 minutes prior to boarding and
was handed another boarding pass with no explanation at all, when I asked what was going on, I was advised that I had been “involuntarily downgraded”.
There was a fellow passenger in the same position who had only days before had a cast removed from her broken wrist.
The ground staff were frankly rude and uninformative, we were told she could give us customer service number but that it was unlikely that we’d get any resolution (how right she was)!
We were offered no alternative and given no advice or instruction on the ground as to how to claim a refund/compensation.
We were left with no alternative but to board.
I approached the individual who was sitting in the seat I was originally assigned, and asked when they had purchased their ticket. She said a couple of months which would put it around July, I had purchased my ticket in the March.
Whilst waiting to take off I went onto the BA site and found the complaint form which I completed straight away.
It is now 18 weeks later and the matter is still not resolved, I am merely asking for a refund of the price difference of economy vs premium economy for the return leg of my flight, seems more than reasonable to me, I’m not even asking for any compensation for the appalling way the whole situation has been handled to date.
It originally took a week or 2 to get a response, which was to offer me an £100 evoucher, and a thanks for the feedback which is apparently invaluable (particularly to me) and assurances that they would endeavour to do better in future!
I clearly and simply further stated my case for a refund and refused the evoucher as unnacceptable, at which point I was offered a £75 cash equivalent. I again “politely” declined and again requested my money to be refunded, I was advised by “customer service” (I obviously use this term loosely, hence the speech marks) that my case has now been referred to the refunds team. Progress you may think, but a further almost 6 weeks on, they still have my money.
At almost every point I have had to chase them for a response.
My advise DO NOT CHOOSE BA IF YOU CAN AVOID IT.
There trustpilot score is abysmal for a reason, in an industry where customer focus should be front and centre BA have none to speak of."
British Airways,After a difficult day,5,"After a difficult day, I was refused onto my flight to New York because of a problem with my ESTA, Its Christmas & most of my family had to leave without me…Some of the staff were very unhelpful, the lady supervisor wasn’t interested in helping at all..?!, But after a new ESTA application was approved, I was free to fly & was helped enormously by a lovely boy called Harvey, he went above & beyond to re book my flight, & really couldn’t have helped more, Shame there aren’t many more Harvey’s in BA, his Customer Service was exemplary & I really couldn’t be more grateful, restored my faith in human nature…"

British Airways,Delayed Response from British Airways for Invoice Request,2,"I recently had a disappointing experience with British Airways' customer service. I requested an invoice for insurance purposes six days ago and have yet to receive any response. In contrast, when I made similar requests to Ryanair and easyJet on the same day, both provided the necessary invoices promptly.

This lack of responsiveness from British Airways is particularly frustrating, especially considering that other airlines managed to address my requests efficiently. Such delays can cause significant inconvenience, especially when dealing with time-sensitive matters like insurance claims.

I hope British Airways will take steps to improve their customer service response times to better meet their customers' needs."
British Airways,I don't know where to start.,1,"I don't know where to start.

About 3 months ago my colleague booked a flight to Argentina and then a few weeks later I needed to change the return flight. This required her to split the booking and add my email. Since that point, despite it having my email address attached to the booking, no emails have come through to me at all.

On the phone, the operator said I was being rebooked on club world, as per my original booking, but when the flight came through on my app it was premium economy. So started about 5 weeks of me phoning BA every week and them doing nothing to help. BA said they had to listen back to the call and see what was promised but that didn't happen and I was never contacted.

Eventually, 2 days before the flight, I was told they had done the call listening and nothing was going to be changed (bear in my I had to phone and chase, BA wouldn't deign to contact me and tell me). I asked to hear the call listening but was told that wasn't possible and that I had to put in some other request. I told them that they had to send me the recording - as per the law enforced by the ICO - but that still hasn't been shared with me 17 days later.

Ultimately - I paid a £430 change fee to fly in a less good cabin. I was then ignored for 5 weeks until it was too late. Aside from all this, BA are now in contravention of ICO law by withholding the recording of the original call and I'll be making this complaint directly to them for hopefully what can be an unlimited fine if they are in contravention of GDPR.

The kicker to all this is that I put an official complaint into BA on 5th December at ~9.30am and received the reference number 04520897. The ""submitted"" page promised I'd receive an email confirming this, which has never come through. On checking the case progress page today with that reference number and my name - I'm greeted by a screen which says they can't find that case.

This is beyond incompetence at this point and to the point where I'm wondering if this is deliberate sharp practice to con passengers out of money. BA is assuming that no one will have the energy to follow the impossible to contact them routes and so give up.

Given that you seem to have lost my complaint - I'm complaining directly to the ICO as well.
I'm sure you won't respond but I have to prove that I've tried (again).

British Airways,Shocking customer care and…,1,"Shocking customer care and communication from BA on flight 154 from Bridgetown Barbados to London Heathrow on Sunday 8/12/24.
Left stationary on tarmac for nearly 6 hours ,after queuing for an hour and a half to drop bags off, even though had checked in on line.
Cabin crew thought the delay was quite funny given it gave them extra stop over time in Barbados.
Crew knew flight would not/could not depart due to technical issue with plane and the consequent delay exceeding their maximum permitted working hours.Captain ,who needs some lessons in customer care and candour,decided we should be served a meal at midnight thus keeping us captive on a plane ,that they knew was going nowhere for a further 90 minutes, until he advised at 1.30am the flight was cancelled and we had to get off!
So a plane full of tired passengers some with young children,some elderly and infirm and some expectant mothers were unceremoniously ejected in the middle of the night to either source their own accommodation or sleep in the terminal with absolutely no assistance from anybody connected to BA.
There was no announcement of the compensation that the airline owed each passenger ,according to CAA rules, and no advice as to what to do re trying to get back to London.
We were dumped in no man’s land ,between the tarmac and the immigration booths, and the airport was essentially totally closed.
The few ,none BA ,ground staff around tried unsuccessfully to source us a hotel room for the night but the island was busy and given it was ,by now, 02.00 there was no room available.
The Captain and crew marched past us no doubt en route to their swanky hotel accommodation and as the captain suggested to all the stranded passengers “ when you are off this plane you are no longer our problem”.
So my take on this is that BA do not display any duty of care to passengers ,when things go wrong, and fail to be honest with passengers regarding their intentions when technical problems arise.They fail to advise passengers of their rights when long haul flights are delayed by over 5 hours and they employ tactics to try and minimise their expenses and obligations to find accommodation for stranded passengers at night.
Had they let us off the plane when they knew it would not fly ,before midnight, we would have had access to hotel rooms so by detaining us another 90 minutes this option became more difficult to access thus saving them tens of thousands of pounds.
They do not employ enough ground staff in Barbados, given the frequency and volume of passengers, and I would urge you to choose another airline when considering flying to this beautiful island.
Shame on you BA and shame on the Captain and crew on that particular flight for appalling care and lack of openness and honesty.
There were many foreign nationals on that flight and I was ashamed at the way our flag carrier treated them."
British Airways,"Not the world's worst airline, but pretty freekin' close",1,"I was a BA Gold flyer back in the 2000s but since then their service has just fallen off the edge of a cliff. Unless they are the ONLY choice I avoid them.

The last two return trips to Belfast have been atrocious. There's not much choice on that route and so I have to submit myself to BA. In my case all FOUR flights were cancelled. This is not unusual, you should at least expect a delay, but cancellations are common. When your flight is cancelled BA will go out of their way to wash their hands of you and have put significant effort into this. It's a shame their flight operations as not as slick as their compensation avoidance. Techniques, such as not answering their phones and leaving you on hold for hours are heavily emplyed. This forces you to rebook tickets, hotel accomodation. When you go to BA to claim these back, and you can any kind of response several months later, they'll then refuse any payment, of any kind, with a well worn playbook. For example telling you, you should contact them to rebook rather than buying any other tickets. The fact they are uncontactable, because an entire aircraft has been cancelled, and the 1 low cost worker in Islamabad can barely deal with the normal load, let alone an entire aircraft does not matter. Even the advice the customer services try and provide is unintelligible and they are not quite entirely sure. Another example is where a parent, back home who was looking after our child, tested positive for covid so we had to get back home. After 90 minutes on the phone we were unsure what to do, the next flight was going imminently and we had to leave to get it. So we bought new tickets and stayed on the phone trying to tell BA to cancel the other flights. In the end it just dropped connection, we got home, and BA refused to compensate us in anyway, even though we told them we had cancelled the flight (this was done over email as they had nobody answering the phones). They told us we should've waited until the new tickets were rebooked before travelling to the airport. When I pointed out we could not make the flight because they were not answering the phones they were unsure waht to suggest. They didn't want to tell me to miss the flight and not get back to the next time, leaving children exposed to COVID, but essentially that's what they recommended.

That brings on to the other problem BA has and it's woeful rack of Commodore 64s they still use to run their back end infrastructure. Trying to navigate their app to make changes is hit and miss at best. I suspect the same low cost worker in Islamabad, answering phones, is also performing their app testing. If you are flying business class with them, and try to modify a ticket (as the covid issue demonstrated) you can ONLY modify for business, you can't modify to economy to get back quicker. So ""Sorry sir, computer says no"".

Overall BA is a joke of an airline, run by Mickey Mouse with customer service provided by Basil Fawlty. I've flown some third world airlines in my life: Bimin Bangladeshi Air, Syrian Arab Air, Air Malaysia. British Airways is by far the WORST airline I've ever flown. I'd even pick Ryan Air over BA. At least they are up front about ripping you off, BA masquearade as a high class airline but ultimately the paint is skin thin and below it is an organisation whose sole purpose appears to be to rip off it's customers."
British Airways,Worst airline in the uk,1,"Worst airline in the uk, terrible customer service."
British Airways,Extremely disappointing experience with British Airways,1,"Extremely disappointing experience, I travelled with British airways to Cairo last September, no issues with luggage, I booked again on December 31 online, it is not clear that the baggage is limited to cabin bag only , I tried to download their app at home I couldn’t because it is rubbish it didn’t work, when I came to the counter she issued me a 95 pounds penalty for my bag , I told her if l know that I will cancel my flight cos I already paid 375 pounds for the ticket preferring BA than other airlines which is cheaper and have clear information, Never again-"
British Airways,Lost my bag and made me incur several additional fees,1,"My recent experience with British Airways was an absolute disaster. From start to finish, their incompetence, lack of professionalism, and complete disregard for their customers made for one of the most frustrating travel experiences I have ever endured.

It began at London City Airport, where I was pressured into checking in my carry-on bag despite my reluctance. I was assured that “everything would be handled.” Instead, this decision turned my holiday into a nightmare. Upon arriving at Palma de Mallorca airport, my bag was nowhere to be found. To make matters worse, there was no British Airways representative at the airport to assist. I was handed a phone number for a call centre, which only added to the frustration.

The call centre staff informed me that I would receive an update within 48 hours - an absurd timeframe considering my holiday was only three days long. I was left without clothes or essential toiletries, which completely ruined the trip. Although I was told I could claim reimbursement for these expenses, the stress and inconvenience were unbearable.

To make matters worse, I have been forced to coordinate between British Airways, another airline, PMI Airport, and London City Airport to try to locate my bag, as nobody seems to know where it is. British Airways eventually claimed the bag never left London City due to an apparent tagging error. However, they have since admitted that they cannot locate the bag and it is officially lost. Despite this, they continue to say they cannot declare it lost until 21 days have passed—an utterly ridiculous policy when it is clear they have no idea where the bag is.

I have incurred international call charges trying to resolve the issue, wasting hours of my holiday speaking to different representatives who all gave conflicting information. The lack of coordination and accountability is appalling.

The call centre staff were unhelpful, unable to escalate my concerns or connect me with anyone who could provide meaningful assistance. Representatives hung up on me or promised to call back but never did. When I attempted to lodge a formal complaint, I was told the only way to do so was via an online form. After submitting my claim, I received no response or explanation, and it was not until I called that the call centre rep and I both learned at the same time that my claim had been closed without any reasoning.

This ordeal consumed my entire holiday, leaving me stressed, frustrated, and stranded without basic necessities. British Airways’ inability to perform such a fundamental task as baggage handling, compounded by their refusal to take responsibility or provide any meaningful support, is utterly disgraceful.

I would strongly advise anyone considering flying with British Airways to think twice. Their disorganisation, lack of accountability, and complete disregard for customer care make them an appalling choice for travel. After this experience, I have no intention of ever flying with British Airways again."
British Airways,Woke Airline please please read this.,1,"Please read this, Me and my Mrs had only 10 flights in 2024 all business class and all European holiday flights, only one went on time, every excuse possible not to fly, a bird strike, a scratch on the wing, air con faulty, pilot overtime, lost slot, fog, cloudy, to windy, no one to operate the jetty, move to another airport by bus, it goes on and on and on and on, they change my fully paid for club class sets without any notification. Also 2 flights they couldn’t serve any nuts because of some nut idiot on board had preferential treatment over the remaining 150 passengers, when did this woke nut lot suddenly invent this, BA said it’s a fatal allergy lol, next time I’m taking a snickers on board, please watch Ricky Gervais nut allergy hilarious and it’s very true, the last 2024 flight which was yesterday was delayed and we sat for over 3 hours on runway for a 1.15 hour flight and then they said the food could poison us due to the delay so didn’t serve any, it was a salad lol again, they are so woke so pathetic it’s beyond a joke, the club class check in T5 is a disjointed mess out of control queue which is now much longer than euro travellers, the club bags always come off last, if you tell of your disappointment the staff look at you with horror as if you are a right wing racist, it’s bonkers, shocking clueless management from the top down, who are these people! The worlds most hated airline, we added it up, we actually spent more time on the runway in 2024 with delays than actual flying, just got back from Geneva spent 3 hours sitting on the runway 2 passengers in club after 2 hours said at least give us a drink, BA crew said we can’t it’s against policy, the 2 lady passengers then were very angry and rightfully so missing a connection flight, in the end BA served some drinks reluctantly. When I boarded this last 2024 flight the attendant said how’s your day going, I said it was ok until I got on this plane, the look of horror her woke jaw hit the carpet, I was right as we sat on the runway as stated for over 3 hours. According to some friends this just doesn’t happen with Ryan air or Easy jet they just go and we watch then out the BA window, It’s a bus nothing more nothing less. BA have taken over so many routes they now need to loose some or all of them. Is it hate speech because I hate them? I’ve got to find an alternative solution for 2025, I promise anyone who reads this there is no exaggeration, it’s worse than I can explain in this review, enjoy your vacation or business trip hopefully without this lot. I’ve never claimed compensation as I simply don’t have the time to fill it all in as they deliberately make it very difficult to talk or claim. I don’t expect a reply. Ohh I forgot they also lost out luggage on a flight."

Are you kidding me??? I canceled within an hour of booking the upgrade - Spoke with Priya who was very nice, however, could not do anything even though I asked her to contact a manager for consideration - I was willing to accept half of my money back - would not do it. Talk about corporate greed!!! No doubt they will rebook those seats and charge the same amount I paid! So now you are double dipping??? Whatever happened to customer service and helping the client??

You have to come all the way to the gate to find about the 1h delay when the board says gate will be closing? No wait... after waiting for an hour it's actually another hour late!

Absurd, I can't believe this is considered a airline of any sort of good, or even decent standard. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE, FLYING LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE."
British Airways,Computer really does say no and repeatedly so,1,"I can hardly begin to explain the terrible service from BA. Having booked flights to Perugia next year in August this year, I received a notification of flight times this week which moved them later in the day by 10 hours which meant a nice late morning arrival was now late evening and too late for me to access my accommodation and coming back very late into Heathrow which by the time I got out I would expect around midnight with a 4 hour drive home and work in the morning.

I tried to contact them by phone with no success - gave up after around 40 minutes and then used their extremely frustratiing chat service - 30 minutes in and the operative still hadn't found my flight details so I told him. He then wanted to check for alternative times that day even though I told him that there were none. I suggested that a suitable alternative would be to move me on to a flight to Florence as that was the nearest airport and the flight times were close to my original. 1 hour in and we're at computer says no and despite telling him my dates were fixed he starts offering me dates either 2 days before or after my booked flight. An hour and 20 minutes in I say I want to complain and he sends me a link to a page that doesn't accept complaints about bookings.

I'm now at over 2 hours of my life I'm not getting back.

I then try the X (Twitter team) who I have found helpful in the past but an hour into that process - still the same outcome.

Now 3 hours I'm not getting back

Following day, I e-mail their director of customer experience to express how disappointed I am at the intransigence of refusing to move a booking from one to another (probably as it will now cost me another £300 on top to cancel and rebook myself when they could do it for nothing since the problem is of their making).

Now the fun starts as I get an admittedly speedy reply from ""Global Customer Relations"" that they can't help as they only deal with a complaint post travel whereas I can't travel because they've change my flights. Apparently BA thinks it can treat customers like dirt and they can't complain unless and until they've actually managed to take a flight.

I go back to them asking where a complaint can be dealt with thinking that there must surely be a process and that perhaps if it isn't their team, they might be able to pass it to the right people. Well they don't have any right people as instead of advising me where I could escalate things to, I get referred back to the phone lines and their chat service.

I try the phone line and get greeted with a message that says ""if your flight isn't in 48 hours go away and stop bothering us"" - I might have made the exact words up a little. So it's back to the bot.

An hour to get connected (we're up to 4 hours of my diminishing lifespan now wasted) and then told that the computers are very slow due to some upload/upgrade and then suddenly it disconnects. Try to get back in and I am number 54 or is it 51 or 55 - it definitely doesn't count down all the time. Gave up after an hour

(5 hours of my life now gone)

Back to X. Put in all my details and wait for an agent - 2 hours passes and no response so at this point so give up and find something more useful to do

(7 hours gone - that's a whole working day)

A reply arrives at 10.54 - 6 1/2 hours after I had first sent a message asking if I am happy to get a refund. By this time, I'd had it and left til today.

No I'm not happy with a refund but it would seem I have no choice. It's ludicrous that BA can't make a simple change when it's down to them that the problem arose. It's even more ludicrous that they deal with complaints just by having no means of dealing with them and its even more ludicrous the amount of time I've had to waste - I'm getting on a bit now - I might not have that much left to waste trying to deal with a problem made by BA which could and should have been sorted in a handful of minutes.

BA - my recent experiences with you have been a catalogue of delays, cancellations and missing luggage but I'm not that much of a masochist that I want to continue in this somewhat abusive relationship"

Booked flights to Abu Dhabi over three months ago and just get sent an email saying they’ve cancelled them… give no reason. Give you the option to rebook but they’ve stopped all
Flights to Abu Dhabi completely. Requested a refund and that will still take 7 working days. They’ve had my money for over 3 months and then cancel and hold onto your money for just a little bit longer. Can you imagine how much money they make on interest if they do this to everyone. Should be reported. I for sure will never use them again"
British Airways,I am reaching out to express my deep…,1,"I am reaching out to express my deep disappointment with the way British Airways has handled our case. Our baggage was lost, and we were told we could purchase the most essential items, such as clothes, underwear, and toiletries, and that these costs would be reimbursed. However, seven months after the incident, we are still being passed from one department to another and have not received any reimbursement.

This situation has left us feeling completely unsupported as customers. I kindly request that the case be reopened and that a prompt update be provided. If the reimbursement process was delayed or if there is any issue, I would appreciate a clear explanation and resolution.

As a trusted airline, I expect British Airways to value customer satisfaction and take immediate action to address this ongoing issue.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your swift response."
British Airways,Would not advise booking a holiday…,1,"Would not advise booking a holiday early wth BA.I booked for 4 people July 25 in Nov24.Unfotunately due to a family issue I cannot go on dates booked.I enquired about changing dates or another holiday through them,but would still forfeit deposit.Both easyJet and Ryanair allow changing, don't book BA early.Sad because their service is good."
British Airways,I had the absolute worst experience…,1,"I had the absolute worst experience with British Airways. I was subjected to blatant discrimination and denied check-in for no valid reason. Following this incident, I reached out to their customer service via numerous emails—none of which were ever acknowledged or replied to.

Frustrated, I decided to call their helpline and was asked to provide additional information, which I promptly did. Despite this, they closed my case without any further communication or resolution. The lack of accountability and customer care is appalling.

I strongly urge everyone to avoid flying or doing any business with British Airways. Their treatment of customers is unacceptable, and they clearly have no interest in resolving complaints or addressing serious issues like discrimination."
Ryanair,What a shameless rip off this company is!,1,What a shameless rip off this company is. I twice tried to make a booking online to Fez from Stanstead and when it came to paying the website said there was a payment issue with any card I tried to use. Called the so called Customer Care number and they refused to take payment over the phone. On both occasions they read the same script to delay the quoted price so the (hopefully soon to be illegal) dynamic pricing more than doubled the price when I tried to book again. Disgusting and one more customer who will never do business with this awful airline.
Ryanair,"Low-cost airlines, low-brow business ethics",1,"The only way to fly to a few places so they treat their customers like dirt and over charge any place they can.

They charged €75 in the last minute because the bag that they've let me a million times through was suddenly too big, this probably applies to all cabin bags with wheels on them and it's their way of forcing people to check the luggage in as they've over sold priority boarding.

Horrible ethicw, such companies worn last long and people won't rwmem5or care when you're gone"
Ryanair,For d 2 flights from Milan to Dublin…,1,For d 2 flights from Milan to Dublin last November 2024.And from Dublin to Gatwick.We the whole family have a very sad and traumatic experience.Ryan sir charge us 60 euro each for hand carry bag.Please take NOTE the same bag size with less 10kg weight and they insisted us to pay extra aside from priority that we have paid.
Ryanair,I have complained about Ryan air …,5,"I have complained about Ryan air before but you have to give credit when credit is due . Flight to Barcelona on 18/01 from Stansted and back later in the day , both flights on time boarding easy and reasonable prices to boot . I would say one thing though The announcements from the Stewards are impossible to understand as they speak so fast , so please slow down ."
Ryanair,Predictably poor,1,"The terrible ethics of the company are not news to anyone these days, however trying to actually easily purchase what I need is far from clear or straightforward on a website designed to mislead and confuse you into buying more than needed. Also booked flights through Ryanair’s website and they still accused me of booking through a third party, and I had to further verify my identity as they obviously don’t like other travel agents operating with their business. Such a shame there aren’t more laws in a market where there so often is no consumer choice."
Ryanair,Simply avoid Ryanair if you want to have decent travel,1,No communication. There always some kind of issue with the boarding or exit and no one is kind enough to let you know the status of your trip. I only fly Ryanair in emergent situations when there’s nothing else available and I’m always prepared for a bad day when I have to fly with them.
Ryanair,The plane landed at Birmingham instead of Manchester Airport,1,"After a delay of (1h 45M) in Morocco Marrakech Airport,We were landed at Birmingham Airport instead of Manchester Airport,
Very late at night and we been waiting for a solution from RYANAIR for more than 2 hours with my family and two little kid's,
with lot of stress,after all told us to sort or self out,Those responsible for RAYANAIR promised us at the airport that all expenses would be paid.
unfortunately my car was in Manchester Airport,Anyway We called a taxi to take us home.
I took train next day to manchester airport to pick-up my car.
About the refund
After a long period of conversations and interrogations, we did not achieve anything
or reimbursement request is stuck in front of a dead wall."
Ryanair,Beware! Ryanair Fast Track should be renamed Fast TRICK!,2,"Booked and paid for Fast Track with Ryanair for our flight from Fuerteventura to Manchester on 18 Jan 2025. Ryanair Flight Information we received via email and Boarding Passes clearly showed Fast Track had been purchased. When we arrived at Security at Fuerteventura we were told Ryanair did not have Fast Track at that airport.
Complained to Ryanair and requested refund. Received a condescending reply saying Fast Track did not guarantee no delays or queues and advising me to arrive with sufficient time to clear security anyway. I did arrive in plenty of time but my complaint was that Ryanair did not have Fast Track in operation at that airport. They are clearly charging for a service they don't provide. Unethical and dishonest practice!"
Ryanair,Shame on you !,1,"at boarding I had to pay 60 euros because my backpack exceeded the measurement scale by 2 cm. Other people were not allowed to fly because they asked why they had to pay. 2 black men had something especially with Romanians. A shame for Ryanair but also for Dublin airport. This is the first and last time I fly with this company!
Shame on you, thieves!"
Ryanair,EU261 directive compensation,1,"The flight from Copenhagen to Rome 30 December 2024 was delayed for more than 3 hours due to technical problems. A voucher for 35 DKK was issued, and when redeemed for coffee it was only valid for 30 DKK. On board there were no real service as staff told us catering was not done due to ""quick turnaround"" so only water, Rose and white wine. No food! Bagage delayed in Rome. Sought compensation through EU261 compensation scheme. Ryanair confirmed and payment should arrive within 5-7 working days. When no money was received I called customer service who informed me that it would now take up to 28 days stating that this was due to slow processing by certain banks. How ridiculous and such a bad excuse. It seems to me the company is trying to delay payment on purpose. The EU states that compensation must be paid with 7 working days. Clearly Ryanair is not complying with relevant regulation"
Ryanair,Scam of a company,1,"Scam of a company. Don’t bother paying extra for Priority or measuring your suitcases in advance and seeing for yourself they are within the dimensions. Had zero problems on the flight over. My suitcase was swimming in the overhead compartment. On the return flight, however, they found a way say mine and two family members’ small suitcases were too large and charged me 225€ at boarding. It’s chaos and they gave me no opportunity to debate, although I certainly tried. They could’ve at the very least refunded those three priority flights, since now I will be going on the flight with just a handbag and with everyone who didn’t pay priority. I just had to pay so we could get on the flight. When I get on the flight, I see these overhead compartments look even bigger than my first flight! I guess this is what I get for trying to save a little bit of money. Never again."
Ryanair,Don’t book parking through Ryan air,1,"Don’t book parking through Ryan air. I requested a booking and they messed up the dates but then refused to amend or cancel the booking and were really rude via the live chat. Totally unwilling to help or provide any sort of guidance to help me resolve. Terrible experience and total waste of my money.
Might be a budget airline, but once you’ve to cover the ways they stuff things up, you may as well pay for a more reasonable airline"
Ryanair,"Rude personnel, scammers!!!",1,"Rude personnel, humiliating an elderly couple and making them pay for two small bags. Other passengers paid for them as they didn't have this money.

Rude on board to GUESTS.

Check in done with 1 desk only. Waited for 1h45min and when we got to desk (I only had to show a certificate) miss ryanair smirkingly told me the flight was closed and I had to pay 60€ extra so she could open it again, otherwise we were not flying.

AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE. THEY RUIN YOUR HOLIDAY, your flight or whatever they can.

Warning: Do NOT fly Ryanair!!!"
Ryanair,Disgusting people work for this…,1,"Disgusting people work for this company. It must be that you have to show you’re a disgusting person to get a job working for them. Two Spanish women bullied me and despite using the same bag to travel hundreds of times, they made it a massive issue and I had to pay extra for my bag. I showed that it fit but they went ahead and bullied me into paying. Disgusting service, ugly people, and I suggest they rethink their job if they cannot be kind, respectful and nice to paying customers. This flight was from Alicante to Bristol on 18 January 4:55pm- one was a blonde fat woman and one was a brown haired woman."
Ryanair,No regrets,1,"I had just list my mother inlaw and had to book a flight to go from Malaga to Copenhagen. By a mistake I booked from Copenhagen to Malaga, and I realised that almost in the minut it was done. As I was forces to go I booked another from Malaga to Copenhagen. Then I phoned Ryanair to get Them to cancel the wrong booking. I was told that that is not possible but I could change my flight.. all other Companyes give you a 24 hour spand to Cancel if you make a mistake, but not Ryanair, so be very carefull that you do not make a fault.Im not Happy."
Ryanair,Luggage rip-off in Rabat airport,1,I was wrongly charged for my luggage at Rabat airport despite arriving within the indicated time frame for boarding. The ground staff said that I was late for check-in and that I had to check my luggage in otherwise I could not fly out. This is not possible because I did the online check-in. The ticket says that luggage can be dropped off until 40 minutes before departure and my payment receipt shows a payment 1 hour before departure. Customer service is pointing towards general sales conditions and does not try to understand the problem. Of course you know when choosing Ryanair that you’ll have problems if something goes wrong but this is a clear rip off. We were 4 people from different groups with the same issue
Ryanair,Horrendous customer service,1,"After spending five hours sat on the runway we were informed the flight would have to be cancelled till the following morning due to heavy fog. That was out of anyone's control in fairness. What happened next was receiving text messages from Ryanair saying they were trying to source accommodation for us. Another text message then came in saying due to the volume they were dealing with we could source our own accommodation, then claim the expense back through the provided link. Since then it has been back and forth after filling out a number of different forms, waiting hours for the online chat only to be misinformed (at one stage I was told oh that was the right form at the time, but it's now changed so you have to fill out a different one. Of course this was only after I chased them up, they would never dream of contacting me first). The customer service is horrendous and they will purposely misinform you to have you going around in circles to put you of persisting with a claim. For the sake of a small claim, they have lost my business for life. Not great business on their part really. My family will never fly with them again on principle alone."
Ryanair,Absolutely appalling airline,1,"Absolutely appalling airline. A case Ive used numerous times apparently suddenly doesn’t fit into the hold they have at boarding pass control. Had to pay £75, absolutely no option as on my own . Will never use this airline again. The staff were so rude about it too, not an ounce of compassion between the five staff . I’m 61 years of age and this is the first solo flight as I have mental health issues. Currently crying in the toilet and they just look straight through you, horrid, horrid staff."
Ryanair,during covid my flight back from…,1,during covid my flight back from tenerife was cancelled by ryanair and it took me 18 months to get my money £732.32] back...kept getting sent from pillar to post with them.....have never used them since or will ever again.
Ryanair,Baggage scam,1,"Baggage scam - Dublin to Madrid flight travelling with husband using matching IT brand cabin bags that , as very frequent flyers (fortnightly), we have flown everywhere with for years. At the gate after I’d been checked (priority boarding) was told my bag was too big and they needed to charge. I demonstrated it fitted in the sizer and that it’s an identical make and model to my husband’s apart from the colour. In addition I only had a tiny handbag and hubby had a half full rucksack. I even offered to place items in husband’s rucksack but was told it wasn’t allowed at the gate. No explanations were given and had to pay. Staff said to apply for a refund, which is surely not the best use of mine and Ryanair admins time. Will definitely swerve this company in future. Sheer money making racket."
Ryanair,They don’t keep to time,1,The flight was delayed over an hour causing us to miss our connecting flight. I do not reccomend this flight asap the staffs were rude and very unhelpful they actually asked us why we didn’t get direct flights instead of their cheaper options.
Ryanair,Never again!,1,"Flew to lanzarote on the 7th Jan from Liverpool, what an absolute nightmare! Didn't get a gate number until final boarding call so then had to run to the gate. Boarded the plane and was then told we would be delayed by half an hour due to ice on the wings. Then another half hour, then another! Then we was waiting for the de-icer truck which kept missing us out. Sat on the runway for 5 hours before taking off and the staff on board just outright refused to give anyone a drink until we was in the air, disgusting treatment. Why put us on the plane knowing it couldn't take off and knowing it would be hours until we could? Will never fly with Ryanair again!"
Ryanair,"My ""go to' for bargain flights",5,You get what you pay for and sometimes more. Most flights overall have been a straightforward experience. I've had a couple of rough landing's in the past but last year was all good. Straightforward bookings and you will pay for wrong suitcase sizes even though the weight might be ok. (PAY ATTENTION) Good assistance at the airports.
Ryanair,Luggage scam,1,"Bought a bag the exact dimensions specified by ryanair, still charged exra €60 luggage for the bag being 3cm larger when filled.

Absolute scam."
Ryanair,Deceitful website designed to squeeze money by purposely getting you to repeat the booking process,1,"Their website purposely pushes you back to the start of the booking process by which point prices have conveniently increased. Three times today the booking journey broke or failed for different reasons, each time it takes you back to the start and clears your basket, then prices have increased.

Deceitful tactics to squeeze extra money out of family’s trying to book a holiday. Don’t know how they get away with this."
Ryanair,Denied Boarding - Difficult to get compensation,1,"Denied boarding made it very difficult to claim compensation and have still not responded to my claim.

All online chat bots etc don't work as they should."
Ryanair,Horrible airline,1,"Horrible airline, rude staff at the boarding till and making you pay extra for cabin luggage even if it fits perfectly in headlocker. Was flying with them for years with same luggage with no issues and all of a sudden our luggage was not the right size and we were charged an extra 150 euros. Of course we were upset but the staff did not care, they were ignorant and they made our 7 year old daughter very upset as well as she did not understand why we were pulled out of the line. From now on I am trying to avoid this hideous airline."
Ryanair,Scammers,1,"I tried to check in online for myself and another person and my booking had disappeared off my Ryanair app. We were charged €130 checking in at Gatwick airport. The only person I could physically show the app to and prove my case to was the check in person, he informed me he didn’t work for Ryanair so there was nothing he could do and there was no Ryanair personnel in the airport. When I got home I contacted Ryanair customer service and raised the issue with them. I was told in no uncertain terms that I would not get a refund and they hung up on me while I still had questions to ask. I treated the rep with respect but they just were not interested. Very poor customer service."
Ryanair,**Review for Ryanair**most terrible airline in this world,1,"**Review for Ryanair**

I recently had one of the most disappointing experiences with Ryanair, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts. From the outset, the professionalism of the staff was lacking, which set a negative tone for the entire journey.

The security check was particularly chaotic. An older staff member was not only rude but also completely disorganized, resulting in our bags being opened and our belongings scattered everywhere. In the midst of this hassle, we inadvertently left behind important luggage worth $3,000. It was incredibly frustrating and stressful.

To add insult to injury, Ryanair charged us an unnecessary $750, which felt like a blatant rip-off. Their service was riddled with blunders, and the staff seemed ignorant and disrespectful. I genuinely cannot recommend this airline to anyone. Save your money and choose a more reliable option."
Ryanair,"I used to recommend Ryanair, but the last incident has changed my perspective.",1,"I’ve always flown with Ryanair and was happy with the service—everything worked well, and I even recommended the airline to others. However, a recent incident has left me extremely disappointed and frustrated.
During check-in for my for Ryanair flight FR8943 from Gdańsk on 19 January, 05:45, I encountered a serious issue. My carry-on luggage, which fully complied with the airline’s size (55x40x20 cm) and weight (approximately 7.5 kg) requirements, was flagged by a staff member. They insisted that I pay an additional 360 PLN, even though my luggage had already been paid for.
To make matters worse, the staff member was rude and unprofessional. When I experienced technical issues with my bank card, I politely asked for assistance in answering a call from my family member to resolve the payment. The response I received was, ""No, I'm busy,"" and only after much insistence, the person reluctantly said, ""Fine, put it on speaker.""
This interaction, combined with the aggressive tone and complete lack of empathy, caused me so much stress that I nearly fainted. I fell to the ground and needed a moment to recover. No one from the staff offered assistance, and my documents were left unattended on the desk, further adding to my anxiety.
I’ve submitted formal complaints to both Ryanair and Gdańsk Airport regarding this incident. However, I feel helpless and unsure of what more I can do to have the unjustly charged 360 PLN refunded.
Has anyone else experienced something similar? What else could I do in this situation to ensure I get my money back? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
I genuinely hope Ryanair takes my complaint seriously and improves their service standards to prevent such incidents in the future. Until then, I can no longer recommend the airline with the confidence I once had."
Ryanair,Blackmail and coercion,1,"Flew out from Manchester to Dublin with 10kg cabin bag - no problems.

Return flight pulled up and charged €75 for the same bag being over sized. Total blackmail perpetrated by by rude ignorant staff.

A young passenger next to me was unable to pay so she was denied boarding and ultimately stranded in Ireland.

UK government should censure this immoral company.

Leary should not be allowed to operate from UK airports"
Ryanair,Buyer beware..,1,"RyanAir is truly an awful company. Normally I wouldn't fly with them, but for an upcoming trip I had to book with them as no other companies had a timetable for flights that would fit. I bought what I thought was a cabin bag for the flight, but come to find that it's a 10kg bag that must be checked in. When I added it it read as a cabin bag, but no no no that's an additional 25 pounds. Of course it's not possible to change the booking, as it would mean the company would lose money they get by being intentionally deceptive Their website is so misleading and I feel scammed."
Ryanair,horrible air hosts at check-in,1,"Two female staff checking in passengers on flight FR 6875 18.01.2025 from Dublin flying to Barcelona were horrific. I witnessed them harassing and scolding multiple passengers. They completely lacked any respect, professionalism or emotional regulation. One of which commented on people’s attitude after passengers haven’t said a word to her… it’s shocking behaviour."
Ryanair,Very unclear bags policy,1,"Very unclear bags policy, despite buying check in bag and had 2 other small bags i had to pay an additional 75 euro for a small bag, what a scam."
Ryanair,Absolutly ridiculous airline,1,Absolutly ridiculous airline! We have been travelling with the same suitcases for years and they were always perfect size as cabin size today very young lady from Rayanair staff who must woke up the wrong size of the bed decided that the bags are too wide by 1 cm!!!!! And charged us 150 euros! ! Absolute joke!
Ryanair,Avoid this airline at all costs,1,"Ryanair will take every opportunity to fine you with fees when you arrive at the airport. The cost of our flights with this airline were more than doubled due to this. If you don't check in online, they fine you an absurd amount at the aiport. We didn't even receive a request to check in online, nevermind a warning of the fee. Carry-on baggage 1 cm larger than the unusually small size requirements? Tack on another massive fee. They prey on the people (like us) stupid enough not to read the reviews beforehand and go with the next least expensive airline."
Ryanair,Ryanair staff at airport when checking…,1,Ryanair staff at airport when checking in to board plane are bad. This particular staff member would not let me board plane. I was made to feel like a criminal. I was eventually allowed on plane. Terrible experience. Very bad training from ryanair.
Ryanair,Ryanair staff forcing 50% of the…,1,Ryanair staff forcing 50% of the passengers to pay extra for their luggage’s even though it perfectly fits. They work on commission and effectively stealing money out of our pockets. You cannot and will not find a worst airline than Ryanair.
Ryanair,Ryanair IT issues,1,"I travel regularly between my UK home from Leeds or Manchester airports and Dublin, where I work and have done so for several years.

Typically I book wither Aer Lingus and Ryanair depending on flight timings. In the past 3 weeks I have made 5 bookings on Ryanair, usually on the mobile app. In each case after I made the booking I received an email from Ryanair to advise that I have been blocked and asked for additional verification as it 'appears' that I am a third party making the bookings, which is not the case. And in each case the verification pages in the Ryanair app did not work for me so I have no choice but to call customer services to explain and have my booking released.

I don't mind the occasional verification check for security reasons, but with 5 bookings blocked on each occasion, this is a major inconvenience and clearly indicates that Ryanair have problem with their IT systems.

Apart from switching my flights to Aer Lingus for my own convenience, I am raising this complaint in the hope that someone in Ryanair can fix the issue."
Ryanair,Why do the CAA allow this company to operate an airline?…,1,"Why do the CAA allow this company to operate an airline? Flight from Kracow to Manchester diverted to Cologne. No word from Ryanair as to why we were dumped in Cologne. After a wait of 8 hours with no word of apology, explantion or offer of refreshments, we boarded another flight landing in Manchester 10 hours late. Animals would be treated better. I would rather walk than use this airline again."
Ryanair,Beware of exchange rates,1,"I made a reservation and I paid with PayPal and selected a Revolut card. PayPal showed me the right currency exchange rate but Revolut made me pay a lot more. I asked for a change of payment method but none of them allowed me to pay with another method.
I asked to cancel my reservation in order to make it again with another payment but the assistance refused it."

My flight with Ryanair was on a brand new plane and it landed 25 minutes early! Provided you stick by their clearly stated baggage policy and don’t try to be clever by flouting it, then complaining, Ryanair are great. I have found them to be far more likely to be on time, and I personally prefer the 737 to an Airbus. More legroom and less claustrophobic."
Ryanair,Dreadful process in verifying…,1,"Dreadful process in verifying identification when tickets have been booked through a travel agent.

Gone through all the steps several times...and just get a generic error message saying 'failed'. Just rubbish

Then live chat...takes 30+ mins...and they simply say...oh try a different browser...or even...switch to Irish English as a preference option"
Ryanair,DANGER GDANSK TRANSFERS,1,"Do not buy transfers with Ryanair. I've had two bad experiences with them, and the most recent one put me in a dangerous situation.

Ryanair uses third-party transfer companies without properly vetting them. When I purchased transfers through Ryanair along with my plane tickets, the instructions were vague. After payment, I was simply told to show up at Gdańsk Airport (having departed from Stansted) and everything would supposedly be sorted. However, when I arrived at Gdańsk, the information desk had no idea about the transfer company Ryanair uses.

I checked my emails and realised that, earlier in the morning, the transfer company had sent an introductory email stating that unless I responded within two hours, they would cancel my transfer! Since this email was sent in the early hours of the morning, I naturally hadn’t seen it. According to their policy, I missed the opportunity to receive the service I had already paid for! (Email proof is available.)

The result? I was stranded at Gdańsk Airport with no way to reach my destination or hotel. I had to pay my way out of the situation by taking a taxi and relying on some unknown and potentially dodgy service. It was an absolute nightmare.

To make matters worse, when I tried to raise the issue with Ryanair via their webchat service, the operator just copied and pasted generic responses and ignored my questions! (Proof of this is also available.)

It was a terrible, terrible experience.

DO NOT TRUST RYANAIR TRANSFERS!"
Ryanair,5 hours delay total. No compesation given and lied to us.,1,"3 hours delay first. When they finally came fater 3 hours, we onboarded and waited 2 more hours in the craft because they made overbooking. They could not solve their problem. Once i requested compesation the refused because the issue according to them was weather factors. They lied to me so i could not get compesation and the real issue was that they overbooked and we waited hours in the airport and then in the aircraft. I wish i could give less than 1 star."
Ryanair,I am absolutely disgusted with my…,1,I am absolutely disgusted with my experience with this pathetic joke of an airline. I had an evening flight scheduled for 19:40 to Manchester. Didn’t leave for 22:00 received no compensation or apology. I was then treated very rudely by the flight attendant who insisted that I force my bag into the measurer. I was then seated in an emergency row with two other people despite the fact this is not allowed by literally any other European airline. The flight attendant then proceeded to invade my personal space when I tried to sit in my seat
Ryanair,Luggage Scam,1,"A shame the money is put before the customer!
Dublin - Venice Flight FR831
Ryanair how low have you stooped for money! Your policy say you are a low cost fare airline, but you are anything to scam customers out of more money!! I traveled years in a row with the same cabin bag and I had no problems even checking the luggage in the luggage frame size. But all of a sudden, on Friday the 17th of January 2025 the same cabin bag was no longer good for the Venice flight because the suitcase zip came out of the frame by less than 1cm. For this reason the staff enforced a payment of €75 for my bag if I would like to embark on the plane. The rudeness of staff was unbelievable!
Ms Kelly Anne Myles you need professional training by Ryanair. Probably you are getting bonuses by raising your voice to go and pay the fees if we wanted to travel. €75 for a cabin bag on top of €40 when I purchased the plane ticket, just because the zipper came out of the frame a few mm, this is ridiculous! Unfortunately I was not the only one facing the same problem. A huge crowd experienced the same treatment. The stress they put on me resulted to lose my passport in the aircraft and at Italian boarder found out i lost my passport and cabin crew had to search 45 minutes the aircraft. Thankfully they found it but results delay and all is because of stress she put on me at Dublin boarding desk. The frustration and stress experienced made me to avoid Ryanair as much as possible in future and I will no longer recommend it to my friends. It's a shame the money is put before the customer!!"
Ryanair,Disgraceful Company - Avoid at all costs,1,"Ryanair cancelled our flights to Tenerife and offered an alternative which was unacceptable. We requested a Full Refund which they agreed but never paid.

The flight attendant are SOOOOO inexperienced, uneducated, unprofessional EVERYTHING is an un at the beginning. The two on the front where TALKING AND LAUGHING LAUDLY ALL FLIGHT LONG. And to put it even worse, when she went to the toilet to take out the trash, she passed by the whole cabin with the dirty trash used for the toilets so people throw their trash inside it. Imagine all the bacteria, the sh*t, and everything else thrown by people using the toilet. I dont know how the european transport agency lets this company run. Its crazy."
Ryanair,My flight was diverted from leeds to…,1,"My flight was diverted from leeds to manchester, Ryanair didn't unload any luggage and got us all to fill out paper claim forms at the airport baggage desk. They didn't give refernce numbers or anything to us. Now no one will talk to me about my lost luggage, they didn't supply onward travel to leeds and told us all to make our own way. Cheap isn't cheap when they lose circa £600 of luggage and it cost £116 in taxis to leeds.
This company are a disgrace and I will recommend no one ever uses them again, I fly 6 times a year and will never use this shambolic company again"
Ryanair,cheap and gets you there.,2,"cheap and gets you there.

staff seem too young so I doubt their capability it a bad situation

airport gate staff tried to argue that my supermarket carrier bag (with crisps and chocolate in it) was Baggage!! naturally i told her off and she gave in

personally I dont buy anything on the plane or pick a seat or even pay for baggage just the minimum amount as thats all flying with Ryanair is worth

Neo planes are better though"
Ryanair,Ryanair Airport Parking,1,"Ryanair Airport Parking

I booked parking via the Ryanair app for Liverpool airport. Never received any confirmation. I’ve chased this with customer services who simply tell me it’s through a 3rd party provider, then they send me an extract of their T&C’s. So they’ve taken my money and I have no means of parking. I will be seeking legal advice."
Ryanair,32 hours stuck in Prague airport due to…,1,"32 hours stuck in Prague airport due to imncompetance and lack of communication and rubbish handling of the problems that came with this situation, shocking for an airline carrier of this size.
Don't expect them to put much care into their passangers when things go wrong.
Imagine this - Ryanair sends a rescue fliight out after 24 hours, only for it to land and airport to tell us they had not sent any crew with the plane so we're not allowed to fly!
Please make an informed decision of who you choose to fly with as loyalty doesnt matter and there's honestly better carries out these, even if slightly more expensive but at least you will be taken care of.
Needless to say, I will not use Ryanair again."
Ryanair,Now they are taking your money with bagagge manipulation,1,"Bought Priority bag then in the airport they forced me to buy a baggage place because bag's wheels were out of metal box. Really ridicilous, and of course they did not return money for priority bag."
Ryanair,refusing to pay refund for services not supplied,1,I paid for fast boarding and air port parking. on the same transaction. Tickets for fast boarding received. No conformation was received for the car parking. Phone calls just went around in circles could not speak to a person always came back send E-mail no good when flying early next day. I had to pay again direct to air port parking. I have been playing E-mail ping pong with Ryan air for 2 months they are refusing to pay monies owed back keep saying it the air port parking to repay even though ryan air did not pass the request across so they still have my money.
Ryanair,As many have mentioned below……,1,"As many have mentioned below… disgraceful company and very unethical, wish I hadn’t booked. Needed to change a name on a flight and their website clearly states “ Within 48 hours of making your booking, you can swap the first and last names free of charge.”, but their customer service was adamant I will have to pay £115 to change it. It’s obviously illegal to not comply with what is mentioned on your website but they don’t give a monkeys. Embarrassment of a company."
Ryanair,Ryanair's lack of professionalism.,1,"Flying back from Krakow yesterday, Most flights were delayed at the airport due to fog, our flight was meant to go at 11:15 but we ended up with a 12.5 HR delay when all the other flights in and out of Krakow were landing and taking off before and after our scheduled time but Ryanair refuse to admit this and just blame it in the weather saying the airport was shut when it wasn't, Even their staff went AWOL to hide away but not before they admitted that the long delay we had was due to them having operational issues and our flight had been sent somewhere else, Ryanair refuse to give us any kind of compensation but said we could possibly win €100 if we enter a competition 😂, We have always gone to Ryanair first for flights in the past but their lack of empathy and culpability is astonishing so now I will always look elsewhere first for a better airline such as Jet2.com."
Ryanair,Think twice before flying with Ryanair!,1,"I had a terrible experience with Ryanair's rules and its staff. After paying £80 for a 20 kg suitcase and 40£ for a smaller suitcase to take with me in the plane, I had to pay £75 penalty for this small suitcase because it didn't fit in that metal box that they use just for 1 cm and a half. I was so angry with the whole experience! I felt like if I committed a crime. The staff is so aggressive and rude that they don't seem human. It was a total nightmare. At the end, they put my suitcase down in the hanger so what was the entire point? This is the way Ryanair meets targets. It is absolutely appalling and disgusting!
I had another very bad experience with Ryanair's customer service in the past. I won't fly with this company again. Worst experience ever!"
Ryanair,I went to trip to Rome and flight was…,1,I went to trip to Rome and flight was late in each direction. Every time I fly with this company they are late. It seems organization really sucks there. I decided not to flight with them any more. Better pay little more and travel normally. I strongly recommended not to travel with them. This is only way they can change their lousy business
Ryanair,Rude and unhelpful customer service…,1,"Rude and unhelpful customer service agent called Ifeoma O. Not only was she unhelpful but after asked to transfer the conversation to a supervisor she ended the chat. I have waited in the queue for over 30min for literally nothing.

Oh my issue was not resolved so wasted my morning"
Ryanair,Ryanair not worth even 1 star,1,Rudest staff ever! Crew at gate in Charleroi tried to prevent my daughter and I from boarding after one of their rude personnel pushed us out of the way. Then the coward manager refused to reveal his name or ID. They only backed down when I threatened to contact airport police. RYANAIR IS THE WORST! NEVER AGAIN!
Ryanair,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!,1,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!

I made a mistake in booking called them straight away and tried to correct the error and they wouldn’t correct it. Had to buy new flights costing almost 300 pounds."
Ryanair,The worst airline!!!,1,"The worst airline!!!
At first my luggage was too big, then I was too drunk!!!
I will never fly with you again, neither me nor my family!!!
I had a 20l backpack, and I paid extra for a 20kg suitcase, but no!
I wasted my time, my friends' time, to sell another ticket.
I'm sick of you, not of the 2 beers I drank!
I wish you bankruptcy!!!"
Ryanair,Ryanair was a complete disaster,1,"Ryanair was a complete disaster. They cancelled my flight last minute, offered no alternatives, and advised me to book with another airline, promising reimbursement. After submitting my claim, they refused compensation, citing vague ""extraordinary circumstances."" Their customer service was appalling—long waits, rude staff, and zero accountability."
Ryanair,Ryanair is a joke and insulting,1,"Unhelpful, no information re delayed flight been at airport for over 9 hours. Been give a £3.50 voucher for food. What a joke when a meal deal there is much more than that!!!
No information re delayed flight of when we will be leaving for Barcelona! No Ryanair staff and no help from Bristol airport!
Never again will we use Ryanair!"
Ryanair,Terrible Experience,1,"Terrible Experience – Unacceptable Treatment

Flying from Tenerife to Ireland with Ryanair was an absolute nightmare. The flight was delayed, and we were forced to stand on the stairs for hours with no proper communication or assistance. To make matters worse, once the door was closed while waiting to board the shuttle, there was no air conditioning or ventilation. It was unbearably warm, hard to breathe, and felt like we were suffocating in a sealed box. This is not just uncomfortable but a serious health and safety concern.

For the money we pay, this kind of treatment is disgraceful. Ryanair should compensate passengers for this ordeal—it’s the least they could do given the stress and discomfort we endured. Completely unacceptable!"
Ryanair,Ryanair consistently delivers bad…,1,"Ryanair consistently delivers bad customer service. It starts with people checking you to people at the gates, it is appalling. Right now they messed up which side is priority - Left or Right . Everyone queued wrongly. The two ladies at the gate are turning people off and instead of apologising since they did not communicate earlier that signs are turned around, they are treating customers badly and looking for bags that are oversized. How poor a customer service could be even for a ‘budget’ airline which was not necessarily charging budget prices for their flights. Avoid if you can. Incompetent."
Ryanair,Ryan Air staff really hates their…,1,"Ryan Air staff really hates their customers. They are always trying to take advantage of you by ripping you off with extra costs for your bags and threatening you that you have to pay extra for your bags or you won’t get your flight. Even though both of my bags (Cabin bag & small bag) fitted in the steel cage. They didn’t care.
The staff always seems to be in a bad mood and are very unfriendly and impatient. They will ask you why it’s taking so long to get out your credit card etc. while rolling their eyes and ripping me off with extra costs. It’s a scam. Was very surprised by that and I even apologized. Now I know that they took advantage of my politeness. I only realized afterwards that their behavior was not okay at all. Will never book Ryanair again."
Ryanair,Its a shame the money is put before the customer!,1,"Ryanair how low have you stooped for money! Your policy say you are a low cost fare airline, but you are anything to scam customers out of more money!! I traveled years in a row with the same cabin bag and I had no problems even checking the luggage in the luggage frame size. But all of a sudden, on Monday the 13th of January 2025 the same cabin bag was no longer good for the Tenerife flight because the suitcase zip came out of the frame by less than 1cm. For this reason the staff enforced a payment of €60 for my bag if I would like to embark on the plane. The big surprise came up when I’ve checked my bank account and Ryanair charged me with 150€ not €60 !! Now I have to deal with another issue and contact the customer service for a refund! The rudeness of staff was unbelievable! When my husband wanted to check his name badge the male staff literally turned it off so we cannot see the name and raised his voice to go and pay the fees if we wanted to travel.
€60 for a cabin bag on top of €38 when I purchased the plane ticket, just because the zipper came out of the frame a few mm, this is ridiculous! Unfortunately I was not the only one facing the same problem. A huge crowd experienced the same treatment. The frustration and stress experienced made me to avoid Ryanair as much as possible in future and I will no longer recommend it to my friends. It's a shame the money is put before the customer!!"
Ryanair,I know you're thinking about it for the…,1,"I know you're thinking about it for the low cost, but just... Don't.

This company was fined millions, by Spain's Ministry of Consumer Affairs, for abusive hand luggage policies and extorting their customers on a daily basis. Perhaps the Polish ministerial equivalent also needs to made aware so they can crackdown on Ryanair in their country as well.

I went with hand luggage outbound from the UK with no issues, using this joke of an airliner, and returned with the same bag with less items inside only to get fined. As did the poor older woman after me whose bag was clearly able to fit without any hassle in their stupid little mock-test box.

Their customer service will do their best to get rid of you and solve nothing when it comes to a fully deserved refund. Do not give this scummy company the time of day, or yours I guarantee will be worse on flight day."
Ryanair,Do not book airport parking through Ryanair.,1,"I have been chasing my missing car park booking with Ryanair for Liverpool airport for 2 weeks.
All you get from Ryanair is that they just take the booking and to contact the provider, which is Liverpool airport. However I have told them twice now that Liverpool airport have no record of the booking, so it must never have been passed onto them.
In reply they tell me again to contact Liverpool airport, as if this not Ryanair's problem, even though they made the booking???
Seriously! You might as well just bang your head in a wall as try to contact Ryanair customer service.
Never booking parking with them again, ever!"
Ryanair,To days flight was the worst flight…,1,To days flight was the worst flight ever it was delited fo 1:30 mins the ryanair is caring abouth what bag you have but they dont care if there drunk people and they wont leave the stewards allone very bad experiences to day
Ryanair,Worst airline to ever exist. I hate them.,1,"My experience with Ryanair was a complete disaster. The staff was beyond unhelpful, the seats were like torture devices, and the whole operation felt like a money-grabbing scheme. They spent the first thirty minutes of the flight screaming overpriced food, drink, etc. prices over the loud speaker, that even my noise canceling headphones couldn’t drown it out. They better stay far away from the United States if they can't provide even basic customer service. I wouldn't wish a flight with Ryanair on my worst enemy! There is not a company that I wish complete and utter failure towards other than Ryanair."
Ryanair,Constantly delayed,1,"Constantly delayed, they don't know how to manage business, absolutely horrendous company . 3 hours delayed and what they give is voucher for 3 pounds, even coffee cost more! One of the most horrible.companies"
Ryanair,I dont even understand how they are…,1,"I dont even understand how they are still operational after their disastrous policies. They charged me £55 airport fee and I was at counter well before 2 hours but check-in wasnt allowed. Also, emails says €55 but they charged £55 and did have not clarification why. Just full of shit...."
Ryanair,"GIFT CARDS NEVER ARRIVED DON""T buy them from Ryanair",1,I purchased gift cards totalling £200 on the 12 December. They never arrived. I contacted customer service on the 27 December to ask for digital cards. It is now the 7 January and I have asked 6 times. Still no email despite their website stating they normally arrive within 2 hours. Customer Service say they have escalated the request and I must be patient. Then close the chat. Surely they must be breaching the Consumer Act by not providing the purchased goods. This is the most frustrating complaints system I have ever encountered. It seems to be designed to block contact. I wouldn't have expected it to be difficult and so time consuming. A simple email would sort it. I am hoping that my bank can help me to get my money back. Ryanair don't seem to care. Quick enough to process the payment but haven't provided the goods. I am so disappointed and angry. I have flown Ryanair many times and not had any issues hence purchasing Gift Cards for family Christmas gifts. Mistake I won't repeat.
Ryanair,APPALLING CUSTOMER CARE. We booked flights to Spain with Ryanair…,1,"We booked flights to Spain with Ryanair in May 2024. In doing so, we also booked car hire and accommodations based on those flight times which are in April/ May 2025. Today, Ryanair informed us our flights have changed by 7 and 6hrs respectively. No reason, no comprehension of the hassle this causes just take it or get a refund! What kind of customer care or service operation is this ? Apart from completely screwing up our car hire pickup/ return, it means we lose a full day on arrival and the same on return as we will be forced to vacate our accommodation early then wait all day for a flight which initially departed at noon ! Absolutely appalling customer service. Avoid this cowboy carrier at all costs !"
Ryanair,Went from malaga to manchester after 4…,1,"Went from malaga to manchester after 4 hour flight delay they told me the plane is overbooked, then had to wait another 1hr30 to sort out hotel and taxi and on whats going to happen next, they advised they would compensate 400 euro and give food vouchers for inconvenience, and id receive this in 4 days automatic, 6 days latter they advise it will be 14 working days from now to confirm the payment. Aswell as never got any food vouchers. Had to pay my own taxi back to airport. Blatantly lied to my face about vouchers and the time itd take to get this money just to satisfy you for time being as after going on customer service the people give no f***s about your inconvenience or what you went through. Customer service was very rude and unninterested in anything you have to say or had to go through. Deffo will be choosing east jet or others next time."
Ryanair,How much worse can Ryanair get,1,Every single airline landed on the day. Ryanair kept postponing for 5 hours then cancelled the flight- due to ‘bad weather conditions’ apparently only affecting them. I booked on the next available flight with Ryanair - they kept postponing then cancelled AGAIN. Honestly what are they flying in??!!
Ryanair,don't buy extras,1,I purchased extras and more precisely a parking with Ryanair and I'm absolutely in a deadlock as they have screwed the arrival and exit timings they are sending me to the parking provider and the parking provider that's me very clear they can't do anything and I have to go to Ryan air.
Ryanair,Overall Ryanair is more expensive - don't use them.,1,"Terrible from start to finish. Obviously we knew what we were in for but still we were shocked. Both outbound and return were delayed by a couple of hours, but main concern is we were made to pay extra for one carry-on to be checked in because it had been damaged (by them) in the outbound flight and so on plastic component was slightly bent out of shape meaning it no longer fitted. We saw two other travellers with the same (undamaged) bag with them as carryon - confirming that the dimensions were correct.
I raised a complaint which obviously was not considered as the response came in less 12 hours and said that the agent applied the policy correctly. Strange how they can be late and imperfect themselves but any slight imperfection from the customer side (even when caused by Ryanair themselves) is cause to be charged extortionate costs.
We also booked a car through them which is another whole story of incompetence and ethical and moral failings but this will be a separate review.
Dont fly RyanAir."
Ryanair,Here’s a revised review based on your…,1,"Here’s a revised review based on your feedback:

My experience with Ryanair, both at Stansted and Belfast, was beyond disappointing. On my flight from London to Belfast, they accepted my cabin luggage without any problems. However, on the return flight, they suddenly refused to accept the exact same bag as cabin luggage and forced me to pay extra. This inconsistent policy feels like a deliberate scam to squeeze more money out of passengers.

The staff at both airports were rude and dismissive, showing no willingness to help or explain their arbitrary rules. It’s frustrating to see an airline prioritize profit over treating customers with fairness and respect.

Ryanair’s practices are dishonest and downright exploitative. I would strongly discourage anyone from flying with them unless you want to experience hidden charges, poor service, and blatant disregard for customer satisfaction."
Ryanair,I will never fly with this airline…,1,"I will never fly with this airline again. My advice to anyone thinking of booking them.. DONT!

Flight has been delayed for 24 hours, no updates (the app is useless and stopped giving notifications after 4 hour delay and then can't find my booking). We got transfer from one airport to another without any notification, we had to find out from ourselves by asking airport staff. Then promised hotel and food. Nothing was given to us and not a single Ryan air staff member at the airport.

Useless and shameless"
Ryanair,Worst experience,1,"Though your tickets are still expensive, now you have to also do their job in their place with the express bag drop system. Bravo Rayan air for finding another great way to screw people over"
Ryanair,Ryanair … we were due to fly Kerry to…,1,"Ryanair … we were due to fly Kerry to Manchester at 3:30 pm. Didn’t board the plane til 6 pm. Then told it’s going to be round 10 pm before we take off.
Fog in Manchester CANT be helped… but waiting till you BOARD already delayed passengers before telling us we will be sat on the tarmac for a further 3 hours COULD be helped. Incredibly disappointing. They’re are small children on board absolutely distraught.
If you’d told passengers in the terminal, we’d have had the option to refuse the flight and leave the airport. Instead , you waited Til we boarded. Insanely irresponsible ."
Ryanair,"Delays can happen, BUT",1,"Delays can happen, sure. But their customer service is TERRIBLE. Their agents cannot provide any useful information. The website advises to download and use the app, which I already had. But after 4 hours delay the flight disappears from the app and so it is useless. When attempting to get more information from an agent the wait times are astronomical (40 mins) and then if you don’t respond within a minute or so (as you need to refresh the site) they disconnect and you start all over again (EVEN THOUGH YOU PROVIDE ALL REQUIRED DETAILS AND YOUR QUESTION CLEARLY). The agents just ignore your text and disconnect to make you wait another 40 mins.

No compensation, no information, you’re just treated like a mushroom (fed sh*t and kept in the dark)…"
Ryanair,Cheap flights,1,Cheap flights. When you add suitcases it becomes more expensive. At least british airways give you a drink & snack. More leg room. You pay the price you see
Ryanair,Ryanair have given us the opportunity…,5,Ryanair have given us the opportunity to see parts of Europe we would never have visited at great prices. Always find them on time and fly to quiet airport.
Ryanair,PLEASE READ - CROOKS AND DECEITFUL,1,"PLEASE READ THIS IF NO OTHER REVIEW! We have learnt something new about the Arline today which I don't think many people will know.

Last year we booked a holiday to fly to Ibiza 8am 11th July 25 until the 14th July Monday evening, so only a short trip. When trying to book more friends onto the holiday we noticed our original flight ceased to exist...When logging back into our account to manage the booking, the flight had changed from 8am to 1pm meaning by the time we arrive etc, we lose the first day....NO EMAIL CONFIRMATION.

I tried to call but they wont answer the phone to anyone travelling more that 30 days from the booking (!) so to the chat bot I went. The agent I spoke to told me ""generally flights which are far in the future may go through multiple schedule changes. Ryanair is not sending the e-mail confirmation unless that schedule change is confirmed""....although the new time is showing on my booking in my 'Manage bookings' part of my account. The reason they won't send the email is because they will have to start swapping peoples flights and issuing refunds.

OK so when will we expect to receive this email so we can swap to a different airline on an early flight? The agents informed me ""The email we get will be 60 days prior to departure if only changed by 1 hour, 90 days if changed 1-5 hours and 120 days exceeding 5 hours"". No good to us when there are flights out with better companies that will most likely be sold out way before then! So here you're trapped.

So now our group is having to wait at the mercy of Ryanair for whatever time they choose to send us, so please just be mindful what you buy IS NOT what you get with them. In essence you are booking something that looks great but you won't actually know what time you will be flying because they haven't yet decided and they wont issue a refund for the outbound flight so we can't purchase flights with another, and no doubt better, airline. ABSOLUTE CROOKS."
Ryanair,The worst company I ever travel,1,"The worst company I ever travel. Picky with all kinds of bags just to collect more cash, I will gladly pay more to fly with otters. Rude employees also, they look like cops"
Ryanair,This is the worst airline in the…,1,This is the worst airline in the world!! They are an absolute rip-off! They charged me extra for my carry on and then charged me again for my connecting flight when I had already paid for the luggage two hours prior. They harassed me about this extra luggage even after paying for it consistently even up until I boarded the plane. They have caused me so much distress!!
Ryanair,The worst airline ever!!!,1,This should be rated the worst airline ever as they are very fraudulent. They took £55 off me at the airport for not checking in online when we all know that the traditional way allows airport check-in. Then they say it's included in their terms and silly conditions when you try to call them back for a refund. The seats were super tight and uncomfortable. Please avoid this people at all cost. They make their flights fairly cheaper so they can collect your money at the airport for not checking in online. They should be banned from operating as an airline. The absolute worst airline!!
Ryanair,Do not book airport parking with Ryanair.,1,"Both our flights for March have been put forward by 5hrs, no if's or but's. Add to that no information received for the airport parking I booked.

All you get from Ryanair is an automated message telling you to contact the 3rd party parking providers they use directly. The problem is that those providers won't interract with you and tell you to go back to Ryanair directly. Then when you raise a case Ryanair again tell you to contact the 3rd part providers directly, and close the case. This is a complete joke and the worst customer service ever."
Ryanair,Baggage scam,1,Absolute rip off with baggage got charged £75.00 for 20mm deep over size on my paid extra for carry on that fitted in the overhead lockers head lockers no problem
Ryanair,"Worst airline ever, avoid at all costs",1,I couldn’t check in online as it came up with error. I then proceeded to the check in counter and was forced to pay €55 per person to check in. The guy on the counter was so rude. He said either pay or you cant check in?? Wtf?? This is not right. Avoid this airline at all costs.
Ryanair,Don’t action refunds for flights they cancelled,1,"Cancelled our booking, notified us by email and moved us to an unsuitable flight the day before without consulting us. We were offered a full refund so I filled in the online form as they charge extra money for you to speak to someone. We had to book with another airline so to date have paid out now for two lots of flights.

Contacted customer service by their online chat. From the gist of the conversation the refund hadn’t been actioned. The agent said he would do immediately.

Meanwhile the flights they have put us on without our permission are still showing as live.

Considering legal action

Ryanair,Poor airline,1,"If 0 star was available I would have given it to Ryanair, for start the staff at the gate are just waiting to charge people for anything they could, then when you get to the plane you have to tolerate some of their cabin crew behaviour and the way they talk to adults as the are talking to a child!
coming back was another story, they charged a fortune as we didn't check in online, also charged £60 for a small cabin suitcase for going and return, this os the same sizeds uitcase that easyjet would permits using the same measurements as Ryanair.
We paid over £300 for nothing, absolutely fraud.
My first time and last time with Ryanair if the don't change."
Ryanair,Doesn't care about their customers,1,"Booked a flight for £280, 6 months in advance. The day before the same flight is £110 cheaper, with a bag and a seat. The random seat allocater gave me a seat right at the back near the toilets, even though there are plenty of available seats which clearly won't be taken since the flight is in less than 24 hours. I'm sick of tired of this airline making a mockery of their customers, they don't care about anything except squeezing as much money as possible out of people."
Ryanair,I gave 5 stars for the cost of flights…,5,I gave 5 stars for the cost of flights and that is the primary reason I fly with Ryanair. For the price I don't expect anything else. Anyone looking for more than just getting from A to B should head to expensive airlines.
Ryanair,Thirsty for Money,1,"Thirsty for Money, they are not even trying to hide it.

Couldn't use the ID verification unless I paid 0,59€ for the ""express"" version. Although no other flight company I ever attended even needed any verification (except for the verification at the airport, for which the ID is for).

Also they didn't let me check-in online without reserving a seat, which I didn't wanted to. So I needed to wait until 24h before the flight (which also is the first time this happened to me while flying)."
Ryanair,Flight cancelled last minute - Ryanair failed to order enough buses for airport transfer and unable to request expenses,1,Flight cancelled from Oslo Torp due to an emergency landing which happened the day before resulting in airport closure (no proactive management contacting customers when this happened or arranging re-routing the day before). No update from Ryanair until departure time. Then had a text to say they would arrange coaches to Oslo international airport. Ryanair had failed to order enough buses to transfer 10 of us to the other airport. And we were told to find our own way there and submit expenses online. Using the online expense system it then says we are not eligible to submit expenses. Appalling customer support. Appalling communication.
Ryanair,Where is the 0 stars when you need it.,1,"Where is the 0 stars when you need it.
I made a mistake one of the bookings and they didn't allow me to change the date even within the grace period of 24h. Because I booked insurance they told me to report it to the insurance, not for my suprise, the insurance doesn't pay for this... Think twice when you book a £15 flight, on top £18 seat, £7 insurance, £60 for a bag and now £40 to change the date, what was advertised as £15, cost me £140, which tax wise, the government only charge tax on the ticket price. So yeah, Ryanair dodgy hidden cost are a ""smart"" way to dodge tax and take advantage of customers, this should be illegal!"
Ryanair,Shameless Scams and Terrible Service,1,"I had an absolutely dreadful experience with Ryanair. On flight FR 3100 from Dublin to Amsterdam, I booked priority boarding, which included a 10kg cabin bag allowance. Despite my bag fitting perfectly in the luggage stand, I was still charged €60. It wasn’t just me either—every second passenger on the flight seemed to be targeted. Their excuses ranged from the bag being too heavy, too big, or not the “right shape.” The staff’s attitude was disgraceful; all they cared about was swiping a card, any card, to take your money—no receipts issued, of course.

Honestly, it’s pathetic that anyone would resort to working for a company like Ryanair. There must be more dignified ways to make a living. The staff on the flight were no better. Feral in fact clicking their fingers at passengers to get their attention. Shame on them and shame on Ryanair."
Ryanair,Complains process designed to obstruct…,1,"Complains process designed to obstruct as much as possible. Disappearing messages, replies that ignore the complaint etc. I’ll avoid Ryanair wherever possible"
Ryanair,What a lack of customer centricity,1,"Ryanair does not care about their customers, it is a company that only wants money with no care nor empathy, creating only unplesant travel experiences. Today, a lot of Ryanair passengers from Eindhoven to Catania had to unpack their luggage’s in the airport, buy new ones and paying additional costs (for luggage’s, priority boarding, and more) just because luggage checking was closed in spite of the flight delay of more than 1 hour….that’s simply indecent! I wish the Ryanair CEO a lot of wisdom for the new year!!"
Ryanair,Hang your head in shame Ryanair,1,"Hang your head in shame Ryanair. Yet another incredibly poor experience at the hands of the most unethical companies out there. This time bags booked but I forgot to check them (my bad), get to the departures desk and the delightful lady (rude and unhelpful) (Ryanair training package lesson 1) then demands £60 per bag. And here's the kicker....they went in the cargo hold anyway. Anyway back at the desk I asked to speak to a manager...she refused to come to the gate but graciously allowed me to speak to me on the phone. Unfortunately she had no answer to my questions so she just hung up (Ryanair lesson 2. If you don't know the answer just be rude and hang up). I don't understand how the regulators are not challenging these unethical business practises. This is people's hard earned money that they are grabbing at every opportunity. Shame on you!!"
Ryanair,Refusing to give refund for gift cards which have never arrived,1,On 25th November I ordered 2 physical gift cards in order to give them as part of my christmas presents to my son and his fiance. At the time of ordering I was told that they took 5-10 working days. The cards still have not arrived but Ryanair are refusing to refund my money. They want me to have digital gift cards instead. These are no longer any use to me as Christmas is now past and the presents have been given. Ryanair have illegally taken £200 of my money.
Ryanair,VILE cabin crew,1,"Shocking attitude from the cabin crew on our flight to Marrakech from Manchester on Christmas Eve 2024.

Bear in mind, that the flight was a 5am flight whereby the whole flight was asleep. The attitude from one of the cabin crew who was called Amber (blonde hair) was disgusting , saying how much of a ‘boring’ flight it was because people were sleeping and not buying anything and questioning why people travel to Marrakech when ‘there is nothing there, it isn’t Tenerife’. Then joking with the rest of the crew about putting the speaker on to wake people up to announce the scratch cards. Her attitude was appalling, she had to carry out the safety procedures and her face and actions was just like she didn’t want to be there. Her attitude when someone stood up ‘SIT DOWN LIGHTS NOT ON’. Her attitude is vile and whoever gets a flight with her, good luck. Don’t appreciate getting an early morning flight to be called ‘boring’ because we were sleeping and not buying anything , disgusting attitude , she needs to change jobs as this job is certainly not for her!!!"
Ryanair,Night mare,1,"Night mare
Check in, in the airport the charged me £50 because I did not make the check in online before I come to the airport.
The flight was late around an hour.
Very crowded.
The aeroplane was so chaotic.
The pilot was very nervous in the microphone yelling at the passengers, takeoff was very harsh.
Landing just like he hit the ground never seen like this landing before.
At the end, my bag did not come with that flight, have to wait for 3 days, my medicines in that bag.
Customer service in Manchester airport was careless, their information was unclear and misleading."
Ryanair,Very good value indeed.,4,"I flew with Ryanair, to Rome and return to the UK. Both flights left on time, outward arrived in Rome, earlier than the scheduled arrival time, and the return flight was on time. I was intending to print my outward boarding pass at home, but the email never arrived, so I had to use the digital version on my phone (which means one has to ensure that the battery is charged). The only error that I knew of, was that on the return flight from Rome to London, they first put the wrong gate number on the board for my flight, so it created some confusion. In fact, the gate shown for my flight, was for a different flight to London, which was delayed by 2 hours, and had originally been scheduled to depart before mine. The error did not affect me, because I did not go to queue up straight away, and I only made my way to the correct gate once I could see that the gates for both flights, the delayed one as well as mine, were on the board. All staff were fine, no complaints. I bought a bag to fit the size as per the measurements stated by Ryanair, to store under the seat in front of me, (""Members"" Holdall 40x25x20 cm. sold by Rymans), and travelled light. Very happy to have such excellent value flights. It cost me under £80 return and that included my chosen seat no. for both flights, however, I did not choose to pay for Priority boarding."
Ryanair,Absolute scum of a company,1,"Absolute scum of a company. Zero customer service, will rob you blind if they can. Couldn’t recommend NOT flying with them anymore. Would be more fun to walk to your destination than deal with these pieces of shit. The whole company needs liquidating. Booked a flight with them, they rescheduled it and sent an email saying I could receive a refund. Upon speaking to an agent online, because who Tf needs to speak to a real person eh? The agent told me I’m not due a refund and that there was nothing else they can do. Safe to say, I’ve contacted the ombudsman and am currently speaking with lawyers to get my money back"
Ryanair,Don't choose this airline if you value respectful customer service,1,"My recent experience with Ryanair was extremely disappointing. My wife and I were traveling with our baby, and we encountered an issue that required assistance. Instead of receiving understanding or support, the staff were dismissive and outright rude to my wife. Dealing with a baby during travel is already challenging, and the lack of empathy and basic courtesy from the staff only made the situation worse."
Ryanair,This has to be the WORST airline ever!,1,"This has to be the WORST airline ever!! WORLDWIDE!!
We forgot our bag and during boarding the lady is such an imbecile me and my family were asking her if we could just go and get it. IT WOULD'VE ONLY TAKEN 5 MINS!!!! And after that we had to make a decision to either miss the flight and go get our bag or LEAVE our bag and get on the flipping plane.
Now, if there was something super important in the bag then we would face a difficult situation. Right...

Sorry guys but I am saying this from the bottom of my heart.
RYANAIR IS THE WORST AIRLINE THAT EVER EXISTED!!
Pls guys if ur gonna book a flight book one anywhere but pls don't pick Ryanair.

Thanks

Ryanair,Ryanair have effectively stolen my money.,1,"Ryanair happily took my money, then changed my flight. The new flight gets in over 24 hours later, meaning I'd miss the wedding I'm travelling to. As the issue is Ryanair's fault, I'm entitled to a full refund, so I rlmy money be returned as instructed in their email. I was told I'd have my money in 24 hours. 96 hours later and my money still hasn't been returned. Customer services basically told me that it's tough and I'll have to wait until they get round to refunding it. I complained and the complaint was immediately closed based on the agent not even reading it (the advice given was the advice I'd already followed). I reopened the complaint, as it was closed based on an incorrect interpretation of my complaint, and it has subsequently been ignored. All the while Ryanair is still withholding MY money."

Ryanair,"I do Recommend Ryanair,",5,"Like all airlines have bad and good ,
I am happy in general depending of the country- Uk are the best for me and my family , travelling with Ryanair for last 15 years , many times per year , we never had problems with them , very nice costumers service , even in a Covid restrictions still been the best .
East Europe the worst, very bad customer service , they need a bit more training, and to be explained ( they don’t own the company, they are representing and they need to act accordingly).

The only thing I would suggest, for priority price (it is a bit high, ) would be good to drop them a bit , and would be more profitable for them . As more people will buy.

Considering it is low cost company they deserve 5* from me ."

And they didn’t allow me to put my hand bag into the desk . So I kept it under the seat .So I didn’t set comfortly.I won’t recommend anyone to use this bullsheet Air again
Ryanair,The flight had 40 minutes delay,1,"The flight had 40 minutes delay, I paid extra even though I had priority. I always travel with the same bags. This time they charged me 75 pounds because one of the bags was too big :(( I usually fligh with Ryan air WITH THE SAME BAGS and never being extra charged. Now because Christmas is coming they though to do extra money. Shame on you Ryan air. I will definitely fligh with different operators from now on. You maybe have cheaper tickets but you have extra charges for bags that usually are normal size for you. SHAME hope your company will no longer exist."
Ryanair,Seats no longer fit for use,3,The quality of some of seating leaves a lot to be desired. I have never experienced such worn out uncomfortable seating on any other European based airline. In addition now Ryanair are asking customers to pay even more for reserved seats and then recommend to customers that they can strap themselves to these seats for as long as possible....for their safety..... whatever about the comfort level. Seats wear out and eventually because unfit for use.. similar to most other aircraft parts... Perhaps it would also be worth perusing the airline's safety statement?!
Ryanair,Worst customer service,1,"I attempted to add extra luggage to one of the tickets, but the website kept giving me a “payment refused” error. I followed their suggestion to try using Chrome in incognito mode, but it still didn’t work. I then contacted customer support for help, but the representative was unhelpful because I wasn’t the person who made the reservation. I had to make the call on behalf of my parents, as they don’t speak English fluently, but instead of assisting, the representative simply told me he couldn’t help and ended the call.

The only reason my parents booked with this company was because they were the only airline offering a flight to Dublin on their preferred date. However, after this experience, they said they’d rather reschedule their trip than book with Ryanair again. Needless to say, we won’t be using this airline in the future."

My Burger was £10.50 my fries £3.50 and my coffee £3.50.
It's just the way they are doing it. Really brief messages.....they know its not coming. It's gonna be cancelled. We are watching Logan Air, and Easy Jet passengers all depart OK. I'll never use these xxxxs again."

Ryanair,Brilliant Company,5,"I fly with Ryanair to Fuerteventura nearly every month for last 3 years, I used to use them for trips to Tenerife before that. Never had a problem, cheap flights but great service, can't believe how many bad reviews they get. I'm already booked for return trip to Fuerteventura in January for £31 return....amazing. I love Ryanair"
Ryanair,Small and narrow seats,3,"Recently went on a ryanair flight from Manchester to krakow. I had massive reservations about using them and by the day of my flight my anxiety was through the roof, not helped by a fairly recent stroke.
Check in was so easy and coasted through no worry about bag sizes or other bits and bobs they seem to like to charge extra for.
To be fair we got exactly what was expected from any budget airline.
Only thing I marked them down for in all honesty was the seat sizes they are very tight. I know I'm overweight but not obese and 6ft1in tall. Sitting in a rock hard seat and squashed between two armrests wasn't fun.
Thatll be why I'll not fly with them again I think if you are paying for a seat you should be comfortable to a certain extent. But ill not dismiss them out of hand if other carriers don't do certain routes."

This company takes you for granted

This Company see's you and treats you like cattle.

Lets all just pay £40 - £60 more and go with any other airline. This company needs to go to the wall."
Ryanair,Incompetent Liars,1,"Checked in online for our recent flight from Alicante to Bristol. My 14 year old boy was allocated his seat and his date of birth was entered which is of course mandatory. He settled into his seat and went to sleep prior to the flight. He was then woken up by a flight attendant who told him he had to move as the seat he was in was by the emergency exit and you have to be over 16 to sit in that seat. Ryanair allocated him that seat being well aware of his age !
I have complained to Ryanair and asked them to explain how this could happen but they are refusing to answer the question and are just fobbing it off so I keep repeating the very simple question to them. Why allocate a seat to a child when they can't sit in that seat ? A very simple question you would think. They have now come back with a blatant lie and told me that the model of aircraft was changed at the last minute and the allocated seat is in a different position. I have researched the seating plan on the supposed new aircraft and it is exactly the same so they are LYING. They have no answer as to why their seat allocation procedure is not fit for purpose. They should be thanking me for bringing this to their attention but instead they fob me off and then blatantly LIE. We all know they are a rip off company but now we know they are incompetent and they are liars."
Ryanair,You get what you pay for.,3,Used Ryanair for dozens of flights and gets you from A to B. Had a few unfortunate incidents but largely out of Ryanair control. This is low cost airline so cannot expect gold standard service. You get what you pay for.
Ryanair,Really terrible,1,"Really terrible, i booked a ticket for a short 30 minutes flight, i had to add the luggage which costed me 70 euros plus, however, when i was checking in, they found that i typed a small mistake in my name, they forced me to pay 70 euros plus or they will not let me board the flight. I wanted to flight cheap but i ended up paying triple the price. Dont save your cents to fly with me, i rather pay more and avoid them. period"
Ryanair,Drunk Passenger Allowed Onboard – Ryanair’s Shocking Incompetence,1,"My recent Ryanair flight from Kraków to Manchester was an absolute disaster from start to finish, and their appalling handling of the situation caused immense stress for everyone on board. It all began when they allowed a clearly drunk passenger to board. The man was visibly intoxicated before entering the plane, passing by other passengers as he boarded, reeking of alcohol. Mid-flight, he started drinking more alcohol, and soon after, he began vomiting. The crew decided he needed medical help, so the pilot announced an emergency landing in Germany.

Upon landing, medics and police were waiting to remove him. However, when the medics checked him, they confirmed he was just drunk, not in need of medical care. They allowed the police to take him away. This delay was entirely avoidable if the crew had exercised basic judgment and stopped him from boarding in the first place.

After the man was taken off, the pilot announced we needed to refuel and write a reports, which would take time. Another hour passed, only for the pilot to then inform us that the crew had exceeded their working hours, meaning the flight couldn’t continue. We were told to leave the plane and wait at the airport without any clear instructions on where to go or what to do. There was no communication—no text, no email, nothing. It was complete chaos.

Passengers, including families with young children, were left wandering aimlessly, unsure of what was happening. Hours later, we were told our flight was rescheduled for 9 PM at a specific gate. Everyone gathered there, but once again, there were no staff or updates. After another hour, the boarding team finally showed up, only to inform us that the flight was now delayed due to weather conditions.

To make matters worse, the same drunk man who caused our original flight cancellation reappeared, acting as though nothing had happened. Shockingly, Ryanair hadn’t blocked his boarding pass! People were furious, and I had to tell the staff to call security because they stood there, completely useless. Security eventually removed the man and his friend, but by then, the damage was done.

We finally departed at midnight—11 hours after our original flight time. Passengers were exhausted, frustrated, and furious. Ryanair’s lack of communication, organization, and professionalism throughout this ordeal was disgraceful.

Ryanair’s poor decision-making and complete disregard for passenger well-being made this one of the most stressful travel experiences of my life. They failed to manage a simple situation, communicate updates, or ensure passengers felt supported. I wouldn’t wish this nightmare on anyone. Avoid Ryanair at all costs if you value your time, comfort, and sanity."
Ryanair,No compassion for their Customers.,1,"I prepaid for a carry on luggage, on day I was travelling I had an accident and strained my back so was not able to lift my carry on back on the plane and onto the lilugg asgd compartment. I went to the check in and explained the situation and asked if they could check my bag in. They refused and asked for another full payment of checked bag which twice what I paid already. I asked if I could pay the difference, they refused so had no alternative but pay again. Their customer service and complaint procedure are as bad and repeated the same story. What this thought me is this company have a policy and staff that makes it worth less than €20. An airline to avoid."

Ryanair,Edinburgh to London flight - extremely rude staff,1,"People at the boarding gates - flight no RK1274 - flight from Edinburgh to London, were extremely rude, entitled and very racist.. absolutely no politeness, 0 customer service and extremely subpar behavior. We've heard horror stories about Ryan air in general but never experienced this personally as we've been living in this continent for over 5 yrs now but the staff at the Edinburgh airport were the worst we've ever come across, across all airlines.

Please teach them basic manners and customer service, a little kindness goes a long time way!"

After all, he is old and finding it harder to travel, so he had a lovely time. They had until going home; a family member is 81. Year old that has to have assistance because he can't walk, their flight was for 7,30 pm it was delayed they took off at 11,30 pm, and arrived at 12,30 am when they arrived back in England Birmingham everyone got off the plane they told the 81-year-old he would have to wait for an hour so he said he wouldn't be able to wait that long and it wasn't there fault they were delayed they had already missed there train to Northampton, so they had a taxi booked for 1 am and they couldn't miss that or they wouldn't get home and explained this but the air hostess didn't care, and then he needed the restroom he was told know. And they did let him after a while because he said he would have to go or he would pee on the floor they also told him to walk himself off the plane even though he told her he couldn't walk the air hostess was very rude and should not be in that job working with the public, how do people like that get a job working with the public it is absolutely a disgrace how an 81-year-old man was treated flight number FR668"
Ryanair,Do not fly with RyanAir if you have a luggage.,1,"Do not fly with RyanAir if you have a luggage. In a flight with 200 passengers, 50 luggages did not arrive, and mine was one of them. We waited in the baggage claim area for two hours and no one was to be found an the RyanAir kiosk. 50+ people waiting to find out what they need to do to get their luggage back and two airport employees finally showed up to tell us that the luggages are no where to be found and that someone will come to the RyanAir kiosk to hand out lost forms for us to fill out. We all line up in front of the kiosk and finally someone comes and gives everyone a form to fill. They do not even speak to any of us, give us no instructions whatsoever about how to fill in the form. So we try to fill it in at our own comprehension. We put our names, flight booking reference, phone number and address. Other parts of the form were not clear on what it needs from us. One day passes, no text message or call. We try calling RyanAir luggage reclaim service multiple times during the day, no answer. We try the live chat, they say the employee at the kiosk should have given us a reference number for the lost report. They had given us nothing. Two days pass, no text message or call. On the third day we go to the airport customer service kiosk. They call for someone from RyanAir. RyanAir representative doesn't ask for any information about our flight or passenger details, and they even tell us off saying why did we even bother coming to the airport. We are told to continue to wait as there are 170+ luggage lost reports from multiple flights. Now we are here, with no information about where our luggage is, whether we will ever receive it, or whether we will be compensated at all. I will never be flying with RyanAir when I have a luggage."
Ryanair,Excellent flights time after time.,5,"I have flown Ryanair on numerous occasions for leisure and have invariably found them punctual, reliable and keenly priced. Their fleet boast some of the newest aircraft of any airline and are invariably spotlessly clean. Their route network is comprehensive across Europe. I find their website clear and easy to navigate. I always pre-select my seat, have Priority Boarding and find my flights to be excellent! The new feature of pre-ordering refreshments from your seat using their on-board app is genius as you get your drinks and nibbles delivered prior to the main trolley service commencing. They are a budget airline and therefore their business model relies on everything being an 'extra'. Hence passengers who try-it-on and fail to comply with strict baggage allowances (in terms of both weight and dimensions) have to pay the penalty fares at the gate. Passengers who don't comply then usually moan that the limits are too draconian or too rigorously enforced - which of course is nonsense. The secret for a stress-free flight is to book your seat in advance (especially if travelling as a couple, family or group) and abide by the baggage rules, paying for any hold luggage you may need. I also also invariably pay for Priority Boarding, Fast Track security and Business Lounge access, which makes travel so much more enjoyable."
Ryanair,Worst airline in the world,1,"Worst airline in the world.

- very limited legroom, seats don’t incline

From the start, the staff was friendly and helpful, making the check-in process smooth and efficient. My flights were punctual, and I felt well taken care of throughout the journey.

Overall, I received great value for my money and was thankful for the positive experience. I highly recommend this airline to anyone looking for a reliable travel option!"
Ryanair,What a horrible experience,1,"What a horrible experience. !
The seats in front were so close that I only had 1 inch between my knees and the back of the seat in front. My bag was under the seat in front so it was impossible to straighten or move my legs at all for the entire flight.
Also I am a 38 ins waist so because the space was so small I couldn’t get the drinks tray to open flat to use.
I would say if you’re more than a 30ins waist, bring your own sandwiches and drink. I hope you get my drift, it’s a disgrace. ! I’ve rated 1 star because they got us from A to B. ☹️"

Ryanair,Ryanair self drop bag at the Faro…,1,"Ryanair self drop bag at the Faro airport is the worse. The self drop bag is not open till 2 hrs 15 mins before the flight. It caused a long queue. You had to scan the qr code to operate the self drop bag machine. For some of the people they just couldn't do it with their phone. For us, not successful at the first time as the machine was frozen. We had to tap on the screen to make it works After completed it, people left at the entrance to
the bag drop point, or people standing on the way to the entrance. No system but two ground staffs there. Very messed to the bag drop point. For us, with a 6 month old baby, and we had 3 x 20kg luggages and 3 hand carriers. The self bag drop service in Faro was totally not convenient for us. The staff seemed to push us to use the self drop rather giving extra assistance when they saw us. Very disappointed."
Ryanair,Return flight costly mistake,1,"I was organising a return flight from Cork to Gatwick and inadvertently looked back on something while using the app and the system defaulted back to the first flight Gatwick to Cork . I did not notice this immediately but when I paid and was immediately sent confirmation I noticed the problem within minutes of making the booking. So I now had TWO flights from Gatwick to Cork.
I spent some 40 minutes waiting on the Ryanair chat, while waiting I checked flights same day from Cork to Gatwick, they were cheaper than that already paid.
Eventually I got through but this contact was very unsatisfactory. I then phone called Ryanair and waited another 45+ minutes. I was told it would cost me more to change than to get another ticket. In essence I literally put £69 in the dustbin and had to ask my son in Cork to re-book as I simply cant afford to.
I'm a pensioner that struggles to make ends meet, how in any mans language is this fair?
UPDATE: I was really aggrieved by my experience described above, I went into the Ryanair app and tried a few things, eventually I found a place I could change/flip the start and destination, the overall cost, £14.
I spent literally 2+ hours on the Ryanair chat and then phone call, I was told repeatedly that I was looking at over £100 fee to change and infact it was recommended I just start again and indeed loose the money already spent!
Not once was it advised I use the app and given instruction how this could be done. What I did pick up on was that a change had to take place within 24 hours, hence I spent the late evening playing around with the app.
It makes no sense that what I did could not be corrected at a nominal fee at worst. Literally within a minute I realised the mistake and immediately tried to make contact, 2 hours later.
One star remains because correcting the simple error was not obvious on the app and support was absolutely atrocious."

Ryanair,Never fly with ryanair,1,"At alicante airport, I was due to board flight from alicante to bristol. I had a checked luggage in the hold and I had a backpack as my underseat luggage. In the duty-free area, I bought some items and I used my own re-suable canvas shopping bag to carry the duty-free items. I checked this was okay with the staff working in duty-free and they confirmed it was. When I attempted to board the flight, the two members of staff checking boarding passes and passports, first scanned my boarding pass but then said that I couldn't board with two bags. I explained that it was duty-free shopping but the members of staff were extremely aggressive and unprofessional and said that I needed to wait by the side. I did as requested and after sometime they signalled me to go through which I did. As I passed by, I asked for the name of the staff member. Then both members of staff there become even more irate and denied me to board. Even through I had been allowed to board, they then denied me boarding because I asked for the staff member's name. They were really nasty, being sarcastic, using racist terms towards me and mocking me that I couldn't board the flight. I again calmly explained that the items in the canvas bag were from duty free and I explained that I had the duty-free receipts at hand to prove it. They both refused to acknowledge the receipts and told me to fit it all in my backpack. They again mocked me saying that they had the power to deny my boarding and that I would lose my checked-in luggage. One of the staff members continued to mock me by imitating zipping my mouth and using racist slurs towards me. I asked what I could do and they said I had to pay a penalty which I did under threat of being detained by security. After paying the penalty, I was then threatened with detainment twice more and taunted by both staff members that I was too late for boarding before I was finally allowed to board. The whole experience has left me extremely anxious to fly ever again, the ryanair staff were horrific and constantly threatening to have me detained and denied boarding without reason."

Ryanair,Worst Customer Service,1,"I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the damage to my checked luggage during my recent flight with your airline.

Details of the flight are as follows:

Flight Number: RK3556
Route: London Stansted to Marrakesh
Date: 23 December 2024
Time: 6:30 AM
Upon arriving at Marrakesh airport, my luggage did not arrive with me and was delayed. I finally received the bag next day, only to find it significantly damaged. This is extremely disappointing, especially considering I paid extra for checked luggage, expecting it to be handled with care.

The photos clearly show the bag was taken both inside and outside the airport, confirming that the damage occurred during transit. We came from the UK, and since the process is entirely online, we were unaware of the need to file a formal complaint at the airport immediately upon arrival. This is why we submitted the complaint as soon as possible afterward.
But staff was not understanding the situation and said we can’t do anything now

I was under the impression that submitting an online claim and providing evidence at the airport would suffice.

The customer service response to this situation has been extremely disappointing and far below expectations.

Really disappointed worst customer service to be honest"
Ryanair,Very very bad experience with this…,1,"Very very bad experience with this airline, if you can call it that, we paid 110 euros for the ticket because we didn't check in on time through the app, where it doesn't say anywhere that you have to check in at least 2 hours before the flight, and we paid for it and we would never return home and have to pay another 150 euros because our suitcases are 3 cm wider than they should be and those same suitcases when we were traveling to Malta from Zagreb normally went with us in the cabin but when we were returning we couldn't and it was the same plane, and it was still 2 hours late but come on, that's okay. Basically the worst airline for travel so the return tickets cost us 600 euros instead of 300 euros"

Only 10-15 minutes for people boarding⁉️

I recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Ryanair's customer service at the airport, and I was thoroughly disappointed. From the moment I approached the desk, it was clear that the staff had little regard for passenger concerns or basic professionalism.

The staff seemed unmotivated and uninterested in providing any assistance . When I asked for clarification or help, the responses were curt and unhelpful. It felt like they were more focused on getting rid of passengers as quickly as possible rather than solving problems or offering any form of empathy.
No final call lost of money and time last time for me as a Ryanair customer.
Given the reputation Ryanair already has for budget travel, I expected minimal service—but this experience left me with the feeling that the company is actively indifferent to the passenger experience. I will certainly reconsider flying with them in the future unless they drastically improve their customer service."
Ryanair,Ryanair Failed to Provide Assistance During Delay,1,"Despite a 2.5-hour delay on flight FR8217 from Barcelona to London Stansted (28 Dec 2024), Ryanair failed to meet their legal obligations under EU Regulation 261/2004.
1. No Food or Drink Provided: Passengers were entitled to food/drink vouchers for delays exceeding 2 hours. I received nothing, and all airport facilities were closed, leaving me without access to basic refreshments.
2. Inadequate Communication: Ryanair staff gave inconsistent and unhelpful information, compounding the inconvenience.

This lack of care is unacceptable. Ryanair ignored their responsibilities, leaving passengers stranded late at night with no support. I’ve filed a complaint and will escalate to regulators if necessary"

We arrived in the airport and explained to the staff member my phone was stolen and had no way to access our account and we would need to check in, the staff member then explained that we would need to pay €120 to book in and I explained we couldn’t check in because my phone was stolen at which point your staff member told us that it was our responsibility to gain access to book in on line and it didn’t matter that we where in the airport 2 hours before the flight. So, we paid the €120 just to get home after have a bad time as it was. That was on till we arrived at the plain and we were pulled from the line by another staff member that told us we hadn’t got priority boarding we would need to pay because we had forgot to leave our 10k baggage at check in to be put in the hold. I also explained what had happened to this staff member and asked her why the staff member at the ticket desk didn’t explain to us that we would need to leave our bags there AND YES, SHE DID SEE OUR BAGS, and guess what she said the exact same thing as the girl at check-in. its like a script you give to them, so they don’t have to deal with people who are been scammed by RYANAIR, so we had to pay another €120. But that wasn’t the end of the story the flight was fine till we got back to Dublin everything was good, weather cold but clear. Which is why there was no reason for how hard the plain hit the runway. I’ve been on a lot of plains Ryanair and other carriers and never have I had this happen I was surprised the under carriage wasn’t damaged and then a fight broke out when we were exiting the plain. So, Ryanair has scammed me out off €240 but I will never fly with you again, so you have lost more then €240 in my custom"

Ryanair,Extremely Disappointed with Ryanair’s…,1,"Extremely Disappointed with Ryanair’s Service on Flight FR4776 (26th December)

I recently flew from Manchester to Shannon on Ryanair flight FR4776 and had an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience. I purchased a priority ticket, which included a 10kg cabin bag. However, the lead manager at boarding was overly strict and disrespectful about the size of my bag.

Although the bag fit into the size checker, he insisted on charging me £70 because a small front pocket—barely 2cm—stuck out slightly. This felt more like a money-making scheme than a genuine enforcement of rules.

What made matters worse was his rude and unprofessional behavior. He acted in a way that was both intimidating and embarrassing, instead of addressing the situation calmly and respectfully. When we asked to speak to a manager, he misled us by referring us to another staff member who clearly wasn’t interested in hearing our concerns. It later became clear that the lead manager himself was the actual manager and had lied to us about his role.

To top it all off, the flight was delayed by over an hour. After such a stressful and frustrating experience during boarding, the delay only added to the disappointment.

This isn’t the first time I’ve had issues with Ryanair’s rigid and inconsistent baggage policies. It increasingly feels like these policies are designed to squeeze extra money out of passengers rather than being enforced fairly.

Ryanair seriously needs to train its staff to treat passengers with respect, honesty, and professionalism. This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable and leaves a lasting negative impression."

The staff should know better and resolved any issues appropriately ."
Ryanair,Priority cabin baggage,1,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience on a Ryanair flight. I had priority cabin bag for my flight from Manchester to Shannon. The leader manager was not only overly strict but also incredibly disrespectful regarding the size of my cabin bag. Despite the bag fitting into the size checker, he insisted on charging £70 because a small front pocket, about 2cm, stuck out slightly.

What made the situation even worse was his rude and unprofessional behavior. He acted in a way that felt like he was trying to intimidate and embarrass me in front of others, rather than resolving the matter calmly and respectfully. When we asked to speak to a manager, he misled us by referring us to a woman who wasn’t listening or paying attention to our concerns at all. Later, we realized the original person we spoke to was actually the manager and had lied to us about his role.

To top it all off, our flight was delayed by more than an hour. After such a frustrating experience at boarding, the delay only added to the poor impression of Ryanair’s service.

This isn’t the first time I’ve had a bad experience with Ryanair regarding baggage. Their rigid and often inconsistent enforcement of bag rules, combined with staff’s unhelpful attitudes, is becoming a pattern. It feels more like a money-making tactic than genuine enforcement of policies.

Such actions are completely unacceptable and leave a lasting negative impression. Ryanair should seriously invest in training their staff to treat passengers with dignity, honesty, and professionalism."
Ryanair,Unhappy with service,1,"I had a major problem with the boarding agents at gate 4 in the Edinburgh airport. I had payed extra for priority mainly for the extra luggage but when I reached the gate, they pulled us to the side and checked our bags. Mind that we have flown on Ryanair airways before one the same type of flight from London to Scotland (JSZIPA) and we had no issues at all. The baggage fit in the over head cabin perfectly and we did not cause any trouble or inconveniences to the crew members and other passengers. Our bags fit in the bag sizer except for the wheels. Why are they making a problem when we had no problem flying in your plane before? What I have observed is that the luggage size box that you are using outside to measure the luggages is not matching with the cabin size. They made us take a decision of whether paying £220 or leaving. I mean if you were flying with a family of 4 for a week and you have to pay this much, you would think twice as well. These people were also very rude. There was only one girl who was talking calmly but there was this woman, can’t remember names as I did not ask for them, who was incredibly rude. She literally scolded and shouted at us. We are a family of 4 who have been travelling for the past week so you can imagine how much money we have spent so £220 was too much. We had to think so we stood to the side, thinking about the possibilities to decrease the amount we had to pay. As soon as boarding was done, we wanted to find out another way but the woman wouldn’t listen. She kept talking over us and shouting. We were very calm. It was to the point where my 2 children starting crying in anger. At the end when they started to threaten us saying that they would unload us, we gave in and decided to pay but they wouldn’t listen. They continued to unload us and close the gates. They didn’t wait at all. We are travellers, not local people so we had no where to go. They made us rebook our tickets, book a hotel, and not to mention, we had to pay for transport. This is too much. They ruined our entire trip. We still have to go to another destination but they have delayed us. The woman was incredibly rude with her words and I quote she said, “This is your problem, not mine”. At the end she starting to put salt on our wounds by saying we have to pay quadruple the amount we could’ve payed and said that she will look out for us when we come back. She thinks we would try and do the same thing again? In the end, I am very unhappy with the customer care they have provided us."

The queue was long at the immigration passport check and even the staff at the immigration passport helped us to skip the long queue so we can manage to board the plane.
We arrived at the desk and there was another queue and once it was our turn, we managed to be on time, which was before 8.20 am to get my boarding pass(I'm the wife, a Malaysian) my husband is Irish, he has got his boarding pass.
See, the layover is 1 hour 20 mins and the flight from Shenzhen, arrived at Brussels at 7.23 am, so we have 1 hour 20 mins layover to get to the desk and so we did our very best to get to the desk to get my boarding pass.
The Ryanair denied us and let us stranded in the Belgium country.We were desperate for money to get another plane tickets.
Euro 200 was too much for us..we had to scrap to make it to get another tickets to rebook with Ryanair, they have flight at 6.05 pm so we had to take it.Why did not they put us on that plane in the itinerary instead of selling us ticket that has 1 hour 20.mins layover? They tricked us into buying this itinerary and made us run around like insane to get to the desk to get our boarding pass.We were only carrying our personal items throughout our journey because we were not allowed to check in any baggage according to Kiwi.com, to let our journey goes smoothly...which is in fact, a nightmare instead!! We are very frustrated that we have to book an accomodation in Dublin since we will have to arrive at 9 pm in Clayton Hotel and bought food and miss my work today on Monday.

Ryanair is a scam, they sell you rotten ticket and gets money from us.All they want is Money from passengers and no seat for them.

Never again and advise everyone to be really carefull when booking with this airline as they simply don’t care!"
Ryanair,After 6 months now taking to court to…,1,"After 6 months now taking to court to get a refund - let alone compensation.. absolute shambles of a company
Absolute joke of a company. 6 months i've been trying to get a refund for a delayed then cancelled flight - after being at the airport for 11 hours with a 2 year old!! Talk about prioritising profits over the healthcare of a child!!

My partner and I, plus our 2 year old son were due to fly on a flight was scheduled to leave Dublin on 11/07/24 at 19:15pm on FR126 to London Gatwick

When we arrived at airport just after 5pm we were notified that the flight was delayed 2 hours to 21:15 - no big deal. We eventually boarded just before 10pm.

The flight departed but after 20 mins was diverted back to Dublin due to a mechanical fault. We arrived back at the terminal around 11pm where i received my only update from the airline via text message that the flight had incurred a fault and would need to go back to Dublin.

After an hour sitting back in Dublin on the plane we were eventually told the fault couldn't be fixed and would need to swap planes, so we exited the plane to the terminal. Just after midnight we boarded a second plane - this plane never left Dublin. It departed the gate but somewhere near the runway turned back to the terminal. Around 2am we were told by the captain this plane developed another fault and we had to disembark again.

We were informed flight now cancelled and we had to collect our bags and go back to check in to get rescheduled for a new flight. After queuing for over an hour a staff colleague then told me all the next available flights up to 11:40am on 12.07.24 were full, best they could offer would be 11:40am, however, there were no guarantees we'd get a seat on this flight.

At this point seeing at that was some 8 hours away, 3:30am - 11:40am, we asked if we were to be offered a hotel to wait in or meal vouchers or something? The representative said they couldn't offer us anything... even knowing we had a sleep deprived 2 year old with us.

Their only response was there was no further assistance they could offer.

Our choice was to wait 8 more hours in the terminal, after being at the airport for almost 11 hours at this point.. or return home. No guarantees of getting on the 11:40am either.

So at 4am, myself - my partner and our 2 year old son had to take the 2 hours drive back home - arriving home at 6am.

I have been chasing Ryanair for 6 months for a refund, but you only get their auto replies saying I have to claim online.. however, as we didn't take the 11:40am flight we're down as no shows and entitled to NOTHING!!!

So because we prioritised our son and took him home to bed, their policy states they don't have to refund us or pay us compensation - yet clearly the law states if a rescheduled flight due to delay doesn't suit, you are entitled to a refund - but try as I might I cannot get this. I have taken it to arbitration who have advised that as we didn't wait the further 8 hours in the terminal we're not entitled to compensation - but doesn't state we can't claim a refund & i am now entitled to take them to court.. which is what I am doing.

Additionally - it seems they turned communications off to us deliberately about the delays on the flight, as I only got the 1 text message - arbitration said had we got an email or further messages, we'd be entitled to more. Absolute farce!!"
Ryanair,Scamming nasty Ryanair staff and…,1,"Scamming nasty Ryanair staff and process on display - again!!! - at Christmas time yesterday - at Gate 49 to Bergamo: 18.30 flight - administrated by a couple of horrible down-market female staff - one of whom randomly pulled me out from my front of the Premium line queue - telling me to put my hand luggage in the ‘does it fit? baggage frame. It fit perfectly but was a cm too fat - with literally a centimetre protruding from the frame. Hateful and very unattractive situation then evolved… as the aggressive Ryanair ticket checker at the gate insisted on charging me £75 for that cm! Only me ( and/or a random set of unlucky folk of course - because I then stayed on to watch her pass through many other passengers with a bigger bag than mine and I commented when she did. Had I insisted on staying there they threatened to call Airport police and not let me board. Of course we passengers know about and can read (here on TP) the appalling - and often overtly shocking reviews! Of course as customers we also know Ryanair is a low-cost minimum service down-market airline - and all that’s fine and acceptable - and people acknowledge they deal with it all for a deep-discount . cost. That aspect should NOT however mean you that you have to face off with openly and obviously scamming, rude and clearly job hating and frustrated passenger facing flight administrators/staff who poison the whole flight experience. Even embracing a sh8te service does have its limits. No proper procedures were at hand re: luggage - ie/ no consistent size nor weight procedure were practiced at the gate. The usual Ryanair chaos and nasty service and engagement were on full display.
Ryanair Baggage Size & Fining is a scam and is perpetuated by Ryanair’s very low quality staff. One always wonders - which I am sure is likely - that the staff are perhaps incentivised by commissions to apply their crooked fines and practices? When you see the prevalent and awful single star reviews for Ryanair it’s worth noting that it’s rarely about the in-flight service that’s mentioned but rather the reviews are the result of awful passenger ‘handling’ by their despicable ground staff upon departures - - the Ryanair low-life staff who make the whole experience unnecessarily unpleasant! Shame on Ryanair - once again! - rinse and repeat - yesterday. You can never really insult their service sufficiently - read the reviews here on TP which are astoundingly bad - and suggest. - by the looks of these awful Trustpilot reviews almost every day - that Ryanair could clearly not care less."
Ryanair,A Disappointing Experience,1,"**Review of Ryanair – A Disappointing Experience**

Unfortunately, I had a very disappointing experience with Ryanair that I feel compelled to share.

I travel with an **alien passport**, which requires a separate visa for travel outside of Europe. Because of this, I was unable to check in via the app, as the system could not handle my documentation correctly. This forced me to resolve the issue at the airport, where I was charged an extra fee – despite having all the necessary documents and not being at fault for the error.

This type of issue has happened to me before with other airlines, but for example, Norwegian handled the situation without imposing additional costs. It should be standard for an airline to assist its customers in such cases, especially when the issue stems from their system and not the traveler.

I found Ryanair’s handling of the situation both unfair and unprofessional. There was no understanding of my circumstances, and I was forced to pay an unnecessary fee that could have been avoided if they had a better process for customers with special travel documents.

I cannot recommend Ryanair to anyone traveling with an alien passport or similar documentation, as their system and customer service are clearly not equipped to handle this. My experience was frustrating and expensive, and I will think twice before choosing to fly with them again."
Ryanair,The worst airline ever!,1,"I‘m extremely disappointment and frustrated with my recent experience with Ryanair.
I had purchased and selected a specific seat - the 1st seat in the first row, which carries an additional fee. However, upon boarding the flight, I discovered that my seat had been changed without any prior notification. I was instead allocated a middle seat in the last row of the aircraft.

This sudden and unnotified seat change not only disrupted my travel plans but also significantly impacted my comfort and overall experience during the flight. As a paying customer, I expect a certain level of service and consideration from the airline I choose to fly with. The lack of communication and the disregard for my seating preferences displayed by Ryanair has left me feeling incredibly dissatisfied and undervalued as a customer.

It is disheartening to see that Ryanair fails to prioritise customer experience and satisfaction. Such actions reflect poorly on the company's reputation and call into question its commitment to meeting customer expectations. As a result of this unsatisfactory experience, I am compelled to avoid flying with Ryanair in the future, prioritising airlines that prioritise customer service and satisfaction."
Ryanair,Improved Service but Unfair Luggage Policies,2,"Over the past year, the service on Ryanair flights has improved significantly, and the onboard staff are generally friendly and professional. I also appreciate the flexible ticket pricing based on the amount of luggage you wish to bring.

However, I’ve had frustrating experiences with how luggage sizes are interpreted, particularly when traveling with a musical instrument. Even if the instrument fits perfectly in the cabin, it was not accepted, and I was forced to pay an excessive additional fee. This lack of consistency and fairness is disappointing, stressful and detracts from an otherwise positive travel experience."
Ryanair,A Nightmarish Experience with Ryanair – A Complete Disregard for Humanity,1,"Our experience with Ryanair was nothing short of shocking. It was a deeply dehumanizing experience where we were treated like animals—utterly unorganized, unprofessional, and completely disrespectful to the passengers who were unfortunate enough to book with this airline.
The chaos began in Krakow, where foggy weather had understandably caused delays. Knowing the challenges weather conditions could impose, we expected some disruption. However, what we did not expect was the sheer lack of professionalism and basic human decency from Ryanair.
Upon arriving at the airport, we were notified of an initial one-hour delay. This was then extended to three hours without any clear explanation. And then, inexplicably, our flight completely disappeared from the departure board. No announcements, no updates via phone, no communication at the gate, nothing. It was as if the flight had never existed. Also no updates in the app. Passengers were left running around the security area, desperately searching for answers, only to encounter clueless staff who sent us in circles between gates and security checkpoints.
When we finally found someone at the gate, a rude staff member brusquely informed us that we were being transferred to Katowice airport to board another flight. Questions about our luggage were met with indifference, leaving us to fend for ourselves. With no guidance, we were forced to navigate endless lines and crowds just to locate the bus to Katowice.
The disorganization was staggering. Passengers waited outside in the freezing cold, in temperatures of -1°C, for hours without proper queuing systems or any concern for our well-being. Meanwhile, inside the airport, my fiancé spent two hours at the lost luggage counter to retrieve our bags, as there was only one staff member assisting hundreds of frustrated travelers. This entire time, I stood outside in the bitter cold, waiting for the bus. It was utterly inhumane.
We finally left Krakow at 8 PM and reached Katowice around 9 PM, only to face more chaos. Long lines at the baggage drop-off, complete lack of communication from staff, and no one who could answer our most basic questions: Would our flight actually depart? Or would we be stranded again? The staff's response was always the same: ""We have no information.""
Eventually, we passed through security again and reached the gate, only to find out our flight had been canceled and rescheduled for the next morning at 9 AM. No Ryanair staff were present to guide us or provide assistance. We were left to figure everything out on our own, exhausted and freezing. Around midnight, we couldn’t bear it any longer and decided to leave the airport to find a hotel. Even that process was a nightmare.
Communication was extremely bad. No one told us that we could book our own accommodation and claim the cost later. Thankfully, other passengers informed us about this. Retrieving our luggage was another horror. Bags were left unsecured on the floor near the carousel, vulnerable to theft. This complete lack of security was disgraceful.
Finding a hotel at that late hour was an ordeal. Most nearby options were fully booked, leaving us to take a 30€ taxi to a hotel 18 minutes away. The last available room cost us 230€, a steep price but our only option for having a shower and some rest.
Adding insult to injury, Ryanair made no attempt to communicate schedule changes. We only learned from fellow passengers that the rescheduled flight had been delayed further to 2 PM the next day. Had we not been proactive in seeking information, we might have wasted the entire night at the airport.
This experience was beyond unacceptable. We understand the need for cancellations due to adverse weather conditions, but the treatment we received was nothing short of disgusting. There was no organization, no communication, and no empathy for the hundreds of passengers stranded. Food and water provisions? A laughable 4€ voucher that was practically useless.
Ryanair’s utter disregard for the comfort, safety, and dignity of its passengers is unforgivable. This was not just a travel disruption—it was a complete failure of basic human decency. We felt neglected, disrespected, and abandoned. No traveler deserves to endure this level of incompetence and mistreatment.
It is so ironic that their motto is ""Low Fares, Great Care."" They embody the exact opposite."

Ryanair,I've been flying with Ryanair for years…,1,"I've been flying with Ryanair for years now and never had an issue. The airport staff has always been very friendly and efficient, and there were never any frustrating delays or other flight issues. Up until today, I was one happy customer. However, and, mind you, I'm drafting this review 5 mins after take-off on my flight from Palma de Mallorca to Vienna, years of truly positive experiences have been annihilated by today's horror show. After having flown with the same cabin bag and hand bag for years now with RA (and by that I mean both pieces were repeatedly cleared by their staff on other flights as compliant with their luggage size policy), today (two days before Christmas, no less), they decided to check everyone's bags for exact measurements (down to a centimeter), which, of course, resulted in 90% of the passengers having to pay 70 EUR for ""oversized"" cabin luggage. The general outrage had very little effect on the check-in staff. You could tell they had prepped for this - zero emotion, zero reaction to people's collective outrage and frustration at the fact that we had all flown with the same bags before (and after they were checked and cleared for measurement compliance), and that RA never charged anyone for that extra 1cm if one's bag was slightly sticking out. As a matter of fact, all of the staff today were pretty abrassive and unpleasant, but I guess that was a defensive mechanism previously set in motion to be able to deal with the mayhem they knew was to follow. I have zero issues with enforcing and sticking to airline policies, but to go through this draconian measurement check two days before Christmas and charge a bunch of desperate people for bags previously cleared by the same company is beyond shameless. In a period where everyone is strapped for cash after having had to spend a bunch of money on presents, etc., this is the perfect way to ruin one's Christmas, and it's just mind-boggling that someone at RA would think it's a good idea. It all just seemed so unnecessary, unfortunate and downright mean. Either enforce a consistent measurement policy on every flight or don't have one. I get that RA has a bit of a bullish, devil-may-care reputation because they are the go-to low-cost airline, but nothing can or should justify the collective desperation of a bunch of nice travellers and decent people who were literally put through 30 mins of unnecessary anxiety, frustration and anger right before going to see their loved ones for the holidays."

Ryanair,Ryanair is dreadfull companyThere is something to say about all…,1,"There is something to say about all airlines, from outside Europe I flew with Royal air maroc a few times, dreadfully costumer service, plane and simple thieves, but talking within Europe I think Ryanair deserves a gold medal for making their clients feel miserable, they were renowned for their hidden fees, and charged 50 eu for printing 1 A4 sheet, but I recently bought a return Amsterdam malaga which costed me more as 800 euro. It started that I didn't got my first name right on the booking, so instead of my first name Evert because of predicting text my first two letters were on the booking, that resulted that I had to buy 1 whole new ticket plus 116 euro for the return, I also paid for a rental car, but when I called with the 044 number of Ryanair they didn't know anything about a rental contract but they did take 89 euro of my account.
When you send a mail to reservations and ask back for your money the A.I generated ""delay and making client tired"" tactics start, asking the same questions but in a different format, they've must have asked 6 times for a screenshot of the transfer, every single e-mail they asked if I was the main driver, every time they asked for my creditcard number, they wear you out, at the end I told them ""keep it, you won"" but I'll never ever fly with you guys anymore, and I'll rain it down with bad reviews on every webpage available on the planet, please people, avoid Ryanair, they are dreadfully disgusting company"
Ryanair,Horrible,1,"Horrible. Horrible. I had a flight to Gran Canaria from Dublin. Had a backpack and of course went with winter clothes. No issues, all fine. On the way back had some winter clothes on a tot and some in the backpack. Got picked! Random! No one else was picked on! Bag filled under the seat, like it came. I didn’t buy anything on the trip. The issue we’re winter clothes that were not ON me. Flight was empty. Woman on the other row sleeping on the empty seats. I had middle seat and then moved to window. Plenty of space!"

Ryanair,The worst airline ever created in the…,1,The worst airline ever created in the history of the world. Not even cheap anymore. Priority boarding is a joke. Make you queue for an hour for no apparent reason. Staff are miserable and there’s no customer service. Every time I fly with them they’re delayed and don’t give anyone a reason or an approximate boarding time and make us stand on the stairs for an inordinate amount of time for no apparent reason. I hate Ryanair and it’s owner with a burning passion.
Ryanair,My favourite airline,5,"My favourite airline. Super consistent. Very rarely late. Yes, there's fees for everything and stuff being sold non-stop on the flight, where the seats aren't the most comfortable, but can't beat the price. The app is quite good outside if the pop-up trying to sell you stuff, it keeps you updated of the gate and flight status quite accurately."
Ryanair,Zero customer service or support,1,"If I could give zero stars I would. Customer service is non existent!! I booked 9 seats for a stag night 7 months in advance. I made a mistake by adding a middle name rather than Christian name for one of our group. I noticed the error within less than 24 hours of making the booking. It cost me £115 to make the name change, this is an absolute disgrace and just a method to extort money from customers."
Ryanair,STAY AWAY!!,1,"STAY AWAY!!! NEVER EVER WILL I FLY AGAIN WITH RYANAIR!!! STAY AWAY! I had paid for excess luggage and been given the ok to bring the carry on trolley on to the flight at check-in but when I then got to gate, I was required to paid 60 pounds for a trolley that was within the dimensions required by Ryanair policy despite having already paid excess lugguage! They took the trolley from me on the plane and told me that I could pick it up at the baggage belt.. but it never came. It is LOST!!! You cannot even speak to anybody at Ryanair. You can only fill out forms."

Ryanair,NOTHING SHORT OF WICKED!,1,"I booked a holiday in Croatia for 5 days. Firstly, the time of the plane was just changed on the app to a really early one that I wanted to avoid and had paid extra not to have. A short time after they changed the day so we had one less days holiday as apparently there were no other flights that day. About 2 weeks after it was changed again! Meaning yet another days less holiday which meant it actually wasn't worth going!! I had to cancel the holiday as sadly it was not worth it. I went straight on line with my original dates to reputable companies like Jet2 and Thompson to find their flights on available holidays were by Ryanair, on the days they told me there was no availability and the flights I was originally booked on!! They are wicked ruining peoples holidays when their greed for more money causes them to lie. Other holiday companies should stop using them and legislation needs to be put in place so that this doesn't happen."
Ryanair,Have Ryanair sunk to a new low by sneakily removing the option to get a refund for medically unfit flyers from their Ts and Cs,5,I was shocked to hear that in their latest round of cost cutting Ryanair have removed the option to get a credit for a cancelled flight if you are medically unfit to travel. Their attitude seems to be that you should claim this against travel insurance but this is not possible for the many who don't have it because of taking internal flights or who do have it with a large excess. Their answer is to change the flight but the fees for this are punitive and it only works if you know when you want to fly. My wife are pensioners She was admitted to hospital last evening and our planned trip to be with family is now not possible. The hospital has documented their instruction not to fly but Ryanair refuse to consider giving a credit even though this was a part of their poli y until very recently. I did not read every word of their revised Ts and Cs when booming but does anybody.
Ryanair,Ryanair has really gone downhill,1,"Ryanair has really gone downhill. They no longer use their own staff and planes, relying instead on outdated, poorly maintained aircraft from unknown companies. The planes feel unsafe and barely functional. Its disapointing to see such a big airline compromise on quality and safety. Would not recommend unless absolutely necessary."
Ryanair,Terrible company,1,"Terrible company, terrible customer service, and the purchasing process is a trap. I paid for extra cabin lugagge but then I was asked to pay 40 euros because I was supposed to have checked it in. Many passengers in the same situation.
At the end, it is not even a low cost company, you pay the same as in any well known airline.
NEVER EVER"
Ryanair,I have flown with Ryanair many times but this experience was the worst.,1,"I have flown with Ryanair many times. But this is the first time when I am truly angry. I have flown with my small gear bag in the past 2 weeks 3 times, all with Ryanair. It’s now time for me to go back to my residence and I am flying from Dublin. All 3 times I have flown, my bag has NOT been checked. I put it into the “measurement baggage check” and it’s the smallest bit popping out. This blonde manager demands I pay €60 for this! I am livid. She was demanding for so many people to pay for the smallest things, and was letting some people go. It was outrageous. I paid and walked out with my small gear bag. I took it onto the plane because the workers didn’t even NOTICE it as a bag to go under the plane. I place it under the seat, and WOW it fits, shocker! I even took a picture! I am so annoyed, this just proves the measurements under the seat and the measurements they ask you to check before boarding are NOT the same. It is ridiculous. And no matter how much you complain, they will never do anything."
Ryanair,Avoid Ryanair at All Costs,1,"Ryanair is an absolute disgrace. I was extorted for £60 for so-called ""extra baggage"" despite paying for priority boarding and not even bringing a carry-on bag. My cabin bag was a mere 1.5 cm over their deliberately undersized measuring device—a blatant scam designed to rip people off. Their staff were rude, unhelpful, and completely uninterested in resolving the issue, and customer service showed nothing but contempt and disrespect.

This airline is shamelessly exploitative, preying on passengers to squeeze every penny out of them. They don't care about providing a fair or even remotely decent experience. Avoid Ryanair at all costs—it’s a complete nightmare, and I’ll never fly with them again!"

Ryanair,Horrible airline,1,Horrible airline. Flights are frequently delayed. Queuing is always chaos with staff not caring about the customers. A few times I have paid to book seats only fir the seats not to exist when boarding and have to be mived and sat with strangers in cramped uncomfortable seats. Have also tried to get a refund for paying for seats that we couldn't sit in but RyanAir are impossible to deal with. Have been in contact with 4 different people so far with no luck. Hate RyanAir.

Ryanair,Extremely Disappointing Experience with…,1,"Extremely Disappointing Experience with Ryanair Luggage Policy

I am writing to express my profound frustration and disappointment with my recent experience flying with Ryanair. Despite complying with the airline’s stated baggage policies and adhering to the specified size requirements for cabin luggage, I was unfairly forced to pay an additional fee for my bag at the gate. This experience has left me thoroughly dissatisfied, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts in the hope that Ryanair will reconsider its practices.

I had carefully checked the Ryanair website to ensure my hand luggage was within the airline's size limits. According to the guidelines, my bag met the required dimensions for carry-on baggage, which should have been acceptable to bring on board. However, when I approached the gate, I was informed that I had to pay an extra charge for my luggage, even though it clearly fit within the allowed size. This was incredibly frustrating, as there seemed to be no valid reason for the additional charge, and I felt completely caught off guard.

When I asked for clarification, the staff provided no coherent explanation for why my bag was deemed “too large” despite it meeting the requirements. I was essentially left with no choice but to pay the additional fee or miss my flight. It felt like a scam designed to extract more money from passengers without any genuine need, and I could not help but feel that the airline was deliberately taking advantage of its customers.

This situation was not only inconvenient, but also incredibly stressful, as I had to scramble to find additional funds at the gate to pay for something that should not have been an issue in the first place. The lack of transparency in how Ryanair handles its baggage rules is a serious concern. It is clear that there is no consistency in enforcing the rules, and this leaves passengers vulnerable to unexpected and unfair charges.

Furthermore, the way this issue was handled by Ryanair staff was utterly disappointing. The personnel at the gate were neither helpful nor empathetic. Rather than offering solutions or demonstrating a willingness to understand my situation, they were dismissive and seemed uninterested in resolving the issue in a fair and professional manner.

Ryanair's baggage policies and customer service are in dire need of improvement. It is unacceptable to charge customers extra money for adhering to the published guidelines, and the lack of clear communication only adds to the frustration. Based on this experience, I will be reconsidering whether I want to fly with Ryanair again and will certainly think twice before recommending the airline to others."
Ryanair,Very bad altitude shown by the lady on…,1,Very bad altitude shown by the lady on the gate from Manchester to Budapest. It’s not acceptable to treat people in this way.
Ryanair,Misleading carryon bag policies...non-existent customer service,2,"This is the second time I've been burnt by this airline. Back in 2018 my family and I traveled to Germany and they lost 2 of our suitcases. It took 4 of the 6 days we were there for them to be tracked down and we had to drive over an hour back to the airport to retrieve them. The entire process was such a headache and I was very dissatisfied so vowed not to travel with them again.

Fast forward 6 years. I had a family emergency and had to fly home quickly. Ryanair was the only airline available to get me from Malta to Dublin in time to make a Dublin to Boston flight. I had a carry on bag and back pack with me.

While in line to board they would not let me proceed as they said my bag was too big. I had flown on 4 other flights over the previous 2 weeks with no issues with these bags. They insisted I pay a €75 fee to gate check the bag and could retrieve my bag on the carousel in Dublin. I tried to explain I did not have enough time to fetch my bag and make it to the connecting flight...in the other terminal. They did not care. At one point the attendant yelled at me and said if I didn't like their policies I could leave my bag in Malta. So rude!!

I asked for a supervisor. She was equally as rude. I again tried to explain that I was needing to make this flight in Dublin so I could make it back to Boston as my mom would be having major surgery the next morning. They did not seem to care. Only option she came up with was to pay the fee (which is exorbitant and ridiculous!) and they would tag my bag and I could ask the flight attendant if it could be stored in overhead.

Out of desperation I paid the fee and boarded the flight. Attendant watched me put the bag in overhead with no issue, it fit fine with plenty of room to spare. Even the attendant agreed their policies are ridiculous and a ploy to get extra money.

On top of all that you have to pay for food and drink items on the flight and the seats are stiff as boards and do not recline.

I do not care for or appreciate how I was treated, especially during such a personally stressful time.

I will never, ever, EVER fly with Ryanair again."
Ryanair,Dublin Airport Staff Loves Stealing From Their Customers,1,"I am here to complain about a very serious situation that happened during the boarding of my Ryanair flight from Dublin to Lisbon on the 17th december, 2024, 16:50, flight number FR7328, reservation number TJQJKY. On this flight, multiple people, including my travel companion who is in this same reservation number, were wrongly forced to pay 60-120€ for hand bags that were WITHIN the size requirements and fully fit within the metal box Ryanair uses to size them. The people at boarding didn't care if they fit, and in some cases didn't allow people to reorganize their bags and try to fit their bags again. They were forced to check in their bags as hold luggage and mind you most of these bags were school type of bags and had no locks, which means they could have easily been stolen. These bags were given yellow labels, which as far as I know, are not allowed to go into the hold luggage and are meant to be put into the cabin, this is extremely irresponsible and careless of Ryanair. The staff lied by saying there was no space anymore in the flight and that because of that bags wouldn't fit into cabin. This is a lie, because there were some empty seats and many cabins had more than enough space. I was also accused of recording this event and threatened, which is false as I was not recording, but since your staff were so scared about it then maybe they should start by not stealing from customers. The bags could fit perfectly under the seat and this is ridiculous service. The only thing truly incredible about this staff: their audacity."
Ryanair,"Ryanair – A Company That Misleads, Overcharges, and Fails to Take Accountability",1,"Ryanair – A Company That Misleads, Overcharges, and Fails to Take Accountability

I want to share my extremely disappointing experience with Ryanair and warn anyone considering flying with them. This has been one of the most frustrating and stressful travel experiences of my life, and I feel it is essential for others to know what I’ve gone through.

First, I booked the Family Plus package with Ryanair, which clearly states that it includes baggage allowances, including four 10kg check-in bags and one 20kg check-in bag. Everything seemed in order when we purchased the package, but things took a sharp turn for the worse when we arrived at Stansted Airport.

Ryanair’s ground staff gave us misleading and conflicting information about checking in our smaller bags. Despite repeatedly asking if we could check in our smaller 10kg bags (which should have been included in our Family Plus package), three separate staff members told us we could not check them in, causing us to carry these heavy bags all the way to the boarding gate.

When we reached the gate, we were told we hadn’t checked in the bags properly, and we were hit with a £240 charge for what was essentially a mistake made by Ryanair staff. We explained the situation, stating that we had followed the guidance given by the ground staff, but were told it was too late to resolve it.

After the ordeal, we reached out to Ryanair’s customer service, hoping they would take responsibility for the issue and refund the unjust charge. However, their response was nothing short of appalling. They refused to acknowledge their staff's mistakes and simply stated that Ryanair flights are non-refundable. They recommended we contact our travel insurer—completely irrelevant to the situation. This is not just unhelpful, it’s a refusal to engage with a valid complaint.

It’s absolutely shocking that a company of Ryanair's size operates this way, misleading customers with incorrect information and then refusing to take accountability for their actions. They overcharged us, misinformed us, and now they’ve shown no willingness to resolve the issue.

This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, and I’m now forced to take further action. If Ryanair is unwilling to refund the £240 they unjustly charged me, I will escalate this matter legally and take it to every consumer platform available. I will not allow this to happen to others, and I will make sure people are aware of the way Ryanair treats its customers.

I am sharing this review across all platforms, and I urge anyone considering flying with Ryanair to be extremely cautious. This company’s customer service is appalling, and their business practices are designed to take advantage of travelers. Don’t let yourself be misled and overcharged by Ryanair—choose an airline that values its customers and takes responsibility for their mistakes.

Ryanair, you’ve lost my business for good, and I will make sure others are aware of your appalling service.

Ryanair,I’m so angry with this company,1,"I’m so angry with this company. I mistakenly booked a holiday for the wrong year with Love Holidays. I realised straight away and was straight on the phone. They changed the holiday for me but I had to change the flights. I tried to do this on the app with no joy. I tried to physically speak to someone with no joy. I then went on to on live chat, no flights released yet for new holiday dates. So I had to bring the holiday forward again, as I saw when I googled flights with Ryan air there were flights available. Wrong in app, no flights showing. Back to on line chat. By this time, I had gone over the 24 hour period by just 45minutes. I was told no flights available. I said, no not on the portal but if you google Ryan air there are flights. He found the flights. He told me there would be a charge to change due to going over tgd 24 hours. I tried to argue thus, as I was originally wishing the 24 hours, again to no avail. I had to pay to change them. Not happy. He then told me through the on line chat £60 pp per flight but through the portal £45. I said it won’t let me do it through the portal.
Long story short, my error originally, tried to put it right immediately but due to Ryan Airs inefficiency and not being able to chat with anyone and the portal bring inadequate it cost me £368 extra. I had no choice otherwise i would have lost £900 cancelling the holiday.
Now I’m trying to complain but can’t find where to do it.
Never ever again will I deal with Ryan Air after this holiday. If I could have sorted the flight changes when I first contacted them, I would have been well within the 24 hours and no charges would have been made for flight changes 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"

The man told me they guys would put my case under the plane they didn’t put it under the plane they lady on the plane told me not to worry and to put it under my seat as it is the right size case so I have paid £112 for mine and my partners case for nothing I’m absolutely disgusted in this
Ryanair,This airline should be charged for fraud,1,"This airline would be so much better if every country would read their own T&Cs. Website states that you can bring 1 CARRY bag for overhead and one handbag for underneath the seat? But yet twice we have flower from Glasgow with no issue but on return we were charged from Belfast, then same agin today from Poland. Choose not to give any of my money to them this time and stuffed what I could in mine and my wife’s bag. And then binned the handbag. I am trying to post pitcher of the website stating what you can and can’t have…….. anyways, not to let this ruin my experience in Poland, next time easy jet or my one and only Jet2

If you can book a different airline then I would advise to ! Mite be a little more money but worth the hassle free trip with other airlines."
Ryanair,Everything went wrong but never again.,1,Everything went wrong. My wife was visiting her son and granchildren pre Christmas for a visit and while there took a bad fall resulting in 2 bad shoulder fractures and a broken leg. I immediately booked a flight that evening and Ryanair were the only ones flying to Luton that I could get on. I packed a bag which is a standard cabin bag I have used dozens of times on Ryanair flights with just a few clothes and some clothing for my wife. However they have changed the sizer that they always used to a completely different type which is just push in with a yellow line which your bag must not protrude past. The girl at the check in desk told a selection of people to try their bags in it and said to me you might as well put your bag in as well in a cocky manner way above her job description. However my bag was about 3mm past the yellow line and we were all charged 75Euro. I objected and asked for a receipt which she blindly and rudely said I dont do receipts. I insisted and she told me would I like to be unchecked in as she put it and said I would receive a receipt by email. Of course I did not and the flight one way cost me just on 200 euro + another 75euro for Ryanairs latest rip off device. Anyway my wife eventually although still injured got her fitness to fly certificate and I booked two flights from Birmingham where she eventually was taken on a Friday evening for the Sunday with Aer Lingus for 154euro for both. They also laid on mobility assistance which was brilliant. I am ashamed to say I flew with Ryanair so many times due to their apparent low fares but be warned if anything goes wrong they will nail you for as much as they can and are far from adverse in stealing money from you when you can do nothing about it. Try the good airlines as honestly it is so much better and make for a relaxing trip. The difference in cost can be cheaper with the good airlines but even if not the difference is minimal.

Ryanair,Total waste of time,1,"Where to start! The mobile site does not let you enter your DOB except by flipping back one month at a time from today's date. When you finally give up and use a laptop they finally inform you that you can not have a boarding pass and need to go to the counter.

As per my passenger rights, I submitted a claim to be reimbursed for the additional meal I had to purchase at the airport during the delay. I initially received an automated reply stating, ""Our Customer Service team will be in touch shortly to update you on your case."" However, it has now been almost two months, and despite sending two follow-up emails, I have yet to receive any response. It seems likely that their policy is to deliberately stall to avoid paying."
Ryanair,Lost wheelchair waited three hours at…,1,Lost wheelchair waited three hours at Alicante Airport to be told the wheelchair had not been loaded at Bournemouth Airport. We had to beg Ryanair lost baggage representative to allow us to use Airport wheelchair to continue to our destination. Our vehicle was parked at Alicante Airport car park for onward journey to Benidorm. Because of waiting three hours longer than intended we incurred €12.35 additional car parking fees at no fault of our own. Ryanair refused to accept any claim or even apologise for their negligence?
Ryanair,Disappointing Service and No Accountability,1,"I trusted Ryanair not only for flights but also to facilitate my car rental booking through their platform. Unfortunately, this experience turned into a nightmare. Upon arriving at Bratislava Airport with my family, the rental car I booked through Ryanair (via Payless Car Rental) was not delivered as promised.

The Payless office was closed despite a confirmed booking for 19:30.
There was no shuttle service, as per their instructions, and 20+ calls to Payless went unanswered.
My family, including children, was left stranded with luggage and forced to arrange accommodation and transportation at our own expense.
Despite this, Ryanair failed to take any responsibility as the intermediary for connecting me with such an unreliable partner. Their customer service has been dismissive, offering only a refund for one rental day—ignoring the significant disruption caused.

Ryanair should vet their partners more carefully and take responsibility when customers face such failures. This experience has severely damaged my trust in Ryanair’s services."
Ryanair,DO NOT RECOMMEND.. extremely terrible experience,1,I have been travelling with ryanair for years. There has been last minute delays and issues which is understandable when we are looking at a budget airline but recently i had an extremely terrible experience with ryanair. 0 value for customer is what I felt. I will never recommend ryanair specially if you are travelling with children. My 11 year old was crying because of the rude behaviour of the staff at the gate at vienna airport. We were offloaded for unjustifiable reasons. We flew to vienna with the exact same luggage as when we tried to flew back from vienna. The staff created a big scene and humiliated us because the backpack sized luggage my child was carrying had a wheel sticking out of their baggage size(exactly just the wheels). I was willing to pay extra for this even if ot was unfair. The biggest disappointment came then when they asked me to pay extra 60 euros for a sling bag which just had our passports and wallet which i have carried on the way to vienna also(but they didnt even ask) and have always carried a sling bag carrying my documents every time i have flown with ryanair before. This was extremely sickening customer service experience. If one wants to save their self respect please refrain from this airlines particularly in Vienna.
Ryanair,Beware of Groundstaff,2,"I have flown Ryanair many times this year and had many great experiences until I flew from Stansted.

The ground staff need to do a course in baggage recognition and how to speak to people. As a business traveler, flying min. twice a month, the ground staff disputed the Samsonite carry on bag I use, was small enough to go on the plane irrespective of the bag clearly fitting in their frame. Once they had been proved wrong the staff were still persistent until I insisted strongly they were being unprofessional and rude. They caused embarrassment. As I was one of the first to get on the plane as a priority pax I had overheard them conversing and stating that they needed to get as many bags in hold as it was a full flight. They were pursuing their narrative rather than being diligent and fair and thus I felt embarrassed and offended by this.

I was so hoping that Ryanair had moved on from this petty mindedness which has prevented me using them in the past and will do now in the future.

Incidentally, I did board the flight with my correct sized bag and please be assured as a reader, this is a flight bag I’ve used for 2 years and they were in the wrong.

Having reviewed Ryanair before on their own platform following a previous flight where they gained a glowing report from me, I was unable to give feedback on this experience

The team on the plane were excellent, this negative is purely aimed at the ground team - tall young lady with glasses and short dark haired guy. Flight to Malaga"
Ryanair,Ryanair is the pits,1,"Ryanair is the pits! I have to frequently fly with them from Manchester to see my family in Barcelona. I had flights booked for Thursday 12 th December returning on 18th December. Unfortunately my husband and I contracted RSV and were totally unfit to fly. I booked alternative flights for January before contacting Ryanair . I explained what had happened saying that I could produce medical evidence of the ambulance arriving etc,and asked for a refund in the light of being frequent flyers and had already booked an alternative flight. I received a reply refusing to consider it. I replied to this asking if they preferred me to fly at the risk of infecting crew and passengers alike - I await their response. I have now spent £450 for 2 return flights to Barcelona when we only need one! Had I changed our flight it would have cost me more than the original booking as The car park I had booked immediately refunded my money less a £10 fee."
Ryanair,Flight was delayed by almost 2 hours,1,Flight was delayed by almost 2 hours. I missed my last train to city because of this. Highly disappointed and annoyed. Ruined my entire trip.
Ryanair,I wish I could give zero stars,1,"It’s been said before but I sincerely wish I could give zero stars. I paid €110 for my return flight to Glasgow. I arrived at the airport an hour and a half before my flight was due to take off. I looked at the app and saw the messags “ online check-in is closed.” I spoke to the lady at the customer service desk who told me that checking in at this point would cost €55. I had no choice but to pay this. €55 of my hard earned money right into Michael O’Leary’s pocket for a flight which I had already paid for. The last thing I needed at Christmas, the most expensive time of year. Disgusting thieves. Will never use again."
Ryanair,Worst Airline ever,1,Worst Airline ever. They will charge you for bags even if you pay for bags in cabin.
Ryanair,Gift card not arrived within 10 days to the UK,3,I have ordered 3 physical gift cards on the 30th of November to arrive at my house. It is now the 13th of December and only 1 card arrived. I don't know where they send the gift cards from but 10 working days is a little extreme. My package arrived in the USA in 10 days and a gift card sent from Europe to the UK is not arriving in 10 days... Even Royal Mail is faster then this. Ryanair you really need to sort this one out in the future.
Ryanair,Crazy charges,1,"Crazy charges, no logic, when they book the ticket, it is obvious that there will be a seat for the booking, but after booking confirmation, they ask to pay for even seat, and the charge for luggage, check in etc., i don't book with this company again, i might pay £50 more in the first place to good airlines, and be relaxed that there won't be any more hidden charge, i am not surprised if the start charging for each use of the toilet. I am surprised how the aviation regulatory is not noticed it and letting the company do this."
Ryanair,Flight Home Change,1,"Had an email saying our plane had changed so need to contact them to change our seats we had paid for, while checking reservation we noticed the flight home had changed to return a day early! no regard that hotels etc have been paid for just we are not flying back the day you booked. I will never use Ryanair, should have listened to the horror stories."
Ryanair,I fly Ryanair from 15 years now,5,"I fly Ryanair from 15 years now . I'm leaving abroad so I fly very often, my personal experience is very positive.

Ryanair,The worst check in experience of my…,1,"The worst check in experience of my life. The self check in machine did not work, even after trying it four times, so I was told to join the queue for manual check in. There was one member of staff handling a huge line of people. The queue did not move for 40 minutes. Meanwhile, other members of staff floated around the empty self check in machines. Shocking. Woeful. Sort out this terrible customer experience Ryanair!"
Ryanair,Wow nice,1,"Take you’re cheap ass somewhere else 46€ for a skateboard is insane or a extra little bag, 46€ i could get 3 meals out of that shit 💀yall must be stupuf or smth ive taken the airplane 4 times with yall and everytime same they let me all of a sudden arab country “sir, its a very strict rule my ass don’t even reply to the feedback please just know you’re reviews are all negative 💀"

Ryanair,Worst flight company,1,"Worst flight company, very rude and poor customer service, they refused to refund the ticket flight ,they treated the people like trash ,I could not travel cause I am sick they absolutely don t care ,zero refund zero compensation this company is the worst ever."
Ryanair,My handle luggage was damaged during…,1,"My handle luggage was damaged during the handling process by staff. When we picked it up after the flight we noticed it was broken. We quickly looked online how to report this. After spending more than 1 hour in Edinburgh airport it was impossible to report it as the Property Irregularity Desk was closed. We arrived late around 22:25 so it was closed.
We still decided to get in touch with Ryanair and provided them with pictures of the damaged luggage but when they got back to us they easily said they can’t do anything about it as it hasn’t been reported in the airport. I asked them to provide clear information on how they want us to report on something if we arrived late after 22:00 hours and the Property Irregularity Desk was closed?
Again, they got back to me saying that they won’t go any further with my query as I don’t have a report form. So basically they were going back in circles to ensure they won’t pay any money back to customers for staff damaging their luggages.
Their reporting process is written and implemented to make sure it’s not clear and hard for the customers to get their money back in these type of situations.
Very appalling altogether."
Ryanair,Worst airline!,1,"Never again! Worst airline! Not compassionate at all. We were supposed to fly from Bristol to Tirana via Ryan air however, we were denied boarding as accordingly our resident permit in the UK is not long enough . I understand that the physical card expiration is until 31/12/2024 ( that’s all over Uk and it was announce!!) but the thing is it’s not yet expire and we are only staying for few days. most importantly all Brp will move to evisa it is only the card which will expire that date. I am a permanent resident. I informed the staff that we have evisa to prove but she declined proudly saying that she knows about it . Multiple incidents happen previously that’s what she said. But ryan air is not Looking for a solution. They just take our hard earned money. Wow! that’s how they do their business."
Ryanair,Harassed my 60yo mother to tears,1,"My sick 60 year old mother was denied the large seat and was harassed by the staff until she started crying, they only stopped because multiple people on the plain stood up for her. Now they're denying me a refund. I'm so enraged I am at a loss of words, how is this legal is beyond me.

I have voice recordings from her from inside the plain to confirm everything but obviously they don't care."
Ryanair,Why can’t they ever run on time,1,"Why can’t they ever run on time. They get you to the gate way before they are ready to board and hoard you into an uncomfortable stuffy area with not enough seating so you can be as hot, bothered and uncomfortable as you can possibly be ready for your hot uncomfortable time on their cramped I’ll fitted hot stuffy planes"
Ryanair,Making us queue outside the plane in freezing cold.,1,"They rushes us to complete 'boarding', to then have us queue outside the plane at 7:20 in the morning. The staff are still prepping the plane. It is freezing outside.
They are consistent in lying about the 'boarding' status.
It is just ridiculous! No apologies, no warning."

Ryanair,08.122024 I was not satisfied!!,1,"12/08/2024 I was not satisfied!!! They did not let me on board the plane with all the priority, although the boarding was still underway. The Riga airport closed the doors to the plane in front of my nose. The information company said that they could offer me another flight to a completely different end of England, for which I also had to pay € 100. They did not offer any compensation for refusing to let me on board the plane, and in addition I had to buy a second ticket, plus the costs of travel from the other end of England to home and moral compensation! I do not recommend it, and I do not understand why this company is not prohibited from treating passengers like this and why their companies are not prohibited from flying!!!"
Ryanair,Fly Ryanair if u want I always fly it but it’s shit,2,Got on the flight and told us that we were in the wrong seats but our pass said we were in the right seats anyway take off and flight was going smooth until they started serving food and drink I was sitting in the aisle and almost broke my knee cap cause they were rushing and bashed my knee of the corner of the trolley. We come down to our descent and there was bad winds in Prestwick so we’re coming down and we start swaying side to side and up and down and we eventually saw the runway and when I say I thought we were going back up I swear we were gonna because the engines sounded like the were in takeoff mode or whatever but we land with a big bang and sway across the runway due to the bad weather anyway captains done amazing job landing so that’s why I gave a 2

We endeavour to ensure that all our customers have a pleasant journey, and we expect our staff to always conduct themselves in a courteous and professional manner and we regret that this was not reflected during your journey. We have forwarded your comments about our staff to the relevant departmental manager to review""

Still it used to be one of the most “on time” airlines, no more: every of my last flights where delayed to very delayed"
Ryanair,flight for €12,5,"the best flight experience.

I really liked the price of the ticket (€12 for a return ticket from VIE (Vienna) to London). flight was a great staff willing to help

it was definitely worth the 12€!"
Ryanair,Would give minus stars if possible,1,Would give minus stars if possible. Currently sitting on a flight that is 3 hrs delayed. The flight attendant Maria called my girlfriend a bad word which I apparently cannot post here for asking a simple question about why she had to move her cabin bag which I paid for… I understand being an steward is a stressful job but if you can’t handle a simple situation maybe it’s not for you… Baffled and extremely disappointed by this experience and will be pursuing consequences through every channel possible
Ryanair,Horrible experience,1,"Horrible experience , rude staff, I could go on for days with it but I’m not gonna waste my time , just DO NOT fly with these bullies"
Ryanair,They are a disgrace of a company,1,"They are a disgrace of a company, their staff have serious attitude problems. Their system glitched on the 15th of November costing thousands of passengers money. They cancelled flights resulting in passengers rescheduling alternative flights only to be told 12hours later it was a glitch and the flight was cancelled in error. They released a statement on the news stating effected passengers will be refunded. This was a lie. I have email's stating they will give a refund and then be told they are sorry for any inconvenience but we are not getting a refund. If this was my fault then that would be my tough luck but this was 100% Ryanairs fault. I have been on the phone to them only to be told ""sorry for any inconvenience, have a nice day"" and then they hang up on me. I wasn't even rude to them. I worked in retail for 14 years so it know what it's like. I hope ryanair staff get a little taste of what they put their customers through."
Ryanair,A Reliable Travel Companion,5,"It’s rare to associate an airline with something as celestial as an astronomer, but Ryanair truly shines like a guiding star in the galaxy of travel options. For the past five years since moving to the UK, this airline has consistently proven itself a reliable, flexible, and innovative companion, making my journeys seamless and joyful.

Let me take you back to a particularly stressful time — the height of the pandemic. My family, scattered across the globe, became a source of both longing and logistical challenges. During this period, I experienced firsthand Ryanair’s excellence. After being denied boarding by another airline (which I’ll kindly refrain from naming) due to outdated Covid guidelines, I turned to Ryanair in desperation. Within minutes, their app provided up-to-date information, allowing me to book a flight for the very next day. The app also made uploading all required documents effortless. From check-in to boarding, everything went flawlessly. That moment of relief, seeing my family despite the odds, cemented my loyalty to Ryanair.

What Sets Ryanair Apart

1. Flexibility in Luggage Options
One of the standout features is Ryanair’s flexible baggage policies. Whether booking months in advance or making last-minute changes, I know I can add checked bags or priority options as needed. On one occasion, I mistakenly thought I had pre-booked luggage due to poor internet connectivity. At the airport, the check-in crew handled the situation with grace, helping me add two checked bags without any surprise fees. The transparency and ease of their process stood out, unlike other airlines that often bury such costs in fine print.
2. A Gourmet Experience in the Sky
Ryanair’s inflight ordering system is a game-changer. Using their app, I can browse a digital magazine and pre-order hot drinks, meals, or even duty-free items like perfumes before takeoff. It’s a small luxury, but being served first—having your coffee and treats delivered before anyone else—adds a touch of VIP treatment to the experience. Try it once, and you’ll never want to go back to waiting for the trolley!
3. Seat Selection Done Right
The ability to pick a seat is a feature many airlines offer, but Ryanair’s consistency and affordability stand out. Whether I’m traveling solo or with a companion, the app gives me the flexibility to choose seats that suit my preferences without fluctuating costs. A personal trick? I often gamble on random selection for myself, but when traveling with someone, I secure their seat first and adjust mine later. This system makes last-minute changes smooth and stress-free.
4. A Team That Cares
Beyond features and pricing, Ryanair’s staff deserves a special mention. Every interaction I’ve had, from ground crew to flight attendants, has been met with kindness, professionalism, and a genuine willingness to help. These moments of excellent service, repeated time and again, have made flying with Ryanair an absolute pleasure.

A Heartfelt Thank You

Ryanair, thank you for being a constant in my life—through the unpredictable UK weather, shifting Covid guidelines, and countless family reunions. You’ve turned what could have been a frustrating necessity into an experience I genuinely look forward to. For anyone considering their next journey, I wholeheartedly recommend Ryanair. From flexibility and innovation to outstanding service, this airline truly deserves its place among the stars."

Ryanair,Scammed from front to back by Staff and treated very RUDELY ....NEVER AGAIN,1,"Asked if need to check-in bag and we were told not necessary as per our bag are standard cabin bags.Got to gate and we were told bags breached size by 1 cm .We had pay 150 extra though we had already paid. We've been travelling with Ryanair for 13 years at least 5 of those with the same cabin bags.Attendant also was extremely rude with us ID LIN0170 Mr. LIN YOUNG got some Xmass bonus. Anyway, Ryanair just lost a long term customer for this! Well done."
Ryanair,Aberdeen to Liverpool or Manchester please!!!!,4,"Ryanair has its faults. No airline is perfect.
I’ve flown with Ryanair maybe 100 times. They are reliable & if you follow the rules, there are no problems. Good value.

My only complaint is they don’t fly Aberdeen to Liverpool or Manchester. I’m certain they would take 100% of business from the utterly dreadful Loganair!"
Ryanair,We have flown with Ryanair for many…,1,"We have flown with Ryanair for many years No surprise we booked with them to go from stansted to Knock for a special concert. We had to cancel due to a potentially serious development in our daughters pregnancy. All the other parts of this booking showed great kindness in refunding or other options. Ryanair stood out as having no contaxtability rejecting all our phone numbers and even our Emails and membership area. I hope we can find a more considerate airline for our future trips....someone who listens and cares.
Think twice before flying Ryanair

Ryanair,Shameful greedy business model and…,1,"Shameful greedy business model and owners, even after court rulings about hand luggage, they keep doing it - cheaper to pay the fine than stopping charging passengers. Shameful"
Scoot,Our flight was overbooked,1,"Our flight was overbooked, forcing us onto another flight 12 hours later. To make matters worse, the second flight was delayed by over 2 hours. Despite the significant inconvenience, the airline refuses to offer even a partial refund and is only providing a voucher as compensation. It’s hard to imagine why anyone would choose to fly with them again after such poor treatment."
Scoot,Unbeatable for the price,4,"Actually I had not a bad experiance with that airline, I flew from Seoul over Singapore to Melborne and i got what i payed for (nothing). I would compare it with Raynair or Wizair in europe.
I would say unbeatable for the price, and even a bit better then expected."
Scoot,Horrible airline for a longer flight,1,"Horrible airline for a longer flight. Think Ryanair but far more profiteering. Had a 7 hour flight between Athens and Singapore, no water provided for free and purchasing on a debit card wasn’t permitted. The staff onboard were unhelpful and uninterested. They also towards the end of the flight did this cheesy gimmick, asking passengers to go and sing a Christmas song in exchange for a key ring. Horrible horrible company."
Scoot,9 hours delay in Greece due to…,1,"9 hours delay in Greece due to technical issues, and when I asked for a compensation they refused. Never again."
Scoot,Delayed the flight by 3 HOURS and notified us only 1 hour before the flight was scheduled to take off,1,"Delayed the flight by 3 HOURS and notified us only 1 hour before the flight was scheduled to take off. Refused to give us food vouchers or lounge access. We had no idea what was going on. Tried calling and they hung up on us. I was starving and hungry in the departure hall. No notifications whatsoever. Useless and disgusting airline. Will never fly in this useless airline again. It's one thing to have a delay, another thing to be so irresponsible."
Scoot,Dishonest behaviourFlight 2:20 hrs…,1,"Dishonest behaviourFlight 2:20 hrs late. Plus a further hour on ground doing something with bags. I missed my connection. Scoot websites say that if delayed more than two hours, refund for that segment available. It cost me over $1000 to rebook connection and overnight in hotel. Scoot dismissed my claim. I have flown Scoot about 24 segments. Now they have lost a customer."
Scoot,We flew Singapore Air to Singapore then Scoot to India,1,"We flew Singapore Air to Singapore then Scoot to India - our luggage was checked in at Perth for the through flight, however Scoop left our luggage in Singapore. It was an absolute nightmare to get any response form Scoot and it took at least 36 hours of constant attempts by us to get a response from Scoot to get our luggage back. Scoot are extremely difficult to deal with and you get no followup or any apology. If it wasn't for a staff member at our hotel helping us I doubt if we would have gotten our luggage back for 3 or 4 days. We were happy with the flights as the staff are very friendly and helpful."
Scoot,3 cancelled flights,1,"3 cancelled flights, a food voucher and a 10 dollar hotel is all they did. 4 months of being told my refund for my food and hotels the other night was approved, only to be gaslighted and told to reapply nearly 25 times!!!!!!!! THEY WILL NEVER PAY YOU BACK DESPITE BEING APPROVED. Liars and thieves"
Scoot,Disrespectful and careless,2,"2 flights, both were significantly delayed. The preorderd and prepaid snack pack was incomplete, no hot drink, without apology or explanation. But the worst thing was that on a night flight of 12 hours (SIN-ATH, 12:35am) the cabin crew turn on the cabin lights and serve meals 5 hours into the flight, interrupting everyone's sleep. After maybe 45 mins they turn off the lights again and stop the service, good luck going back to sleep. Totally brainless behavior.
Aside from that, they sell premium seats with the promise of extended legroom - not true because there is a separation wall right in front of you so you can never stretch your legs - and of ""scoot in silence"", which is also a hoax as the cabin crew rush up and down the aisles at all times and random passengers who haven't booked that section and aren't aware of its purpose get assigned seats upon check-in, which again defies the purpose and the promise they charged extra for"
Scoot,Please honour your flight bookings and don't change passengers' bookings as and when you like.,1,"Scoot changed my flight time 1 month plus before the flight without any prior warning. The new flight time will depart 10 hours later than the original flight time! I mean if it's because of urgent uncontrollable conditions e.g. weather, political situations etc. I understand, but 1 month plus before you just change my flight time ""due to operational reasons""!?

This has caused me unnecessary stress and wasted a lot of my time to re-plan my upcoming trip again.

Apparently, my colleague has faced before the same type of issue from them as well."
Scoot,Flyscoot is a claustrophobic small…,1,Flyscoot is a claustrophobic small plane. With two seaters on each side and a narrow walkway in the middle. When arrived in Laos our luggages did not arrive. It was left in Singapore because the plane was too small to take in those luggages. They have to send the luggages two days later because they only fly few times a week to Laos. A very huge inconvenience for us.
Scoot,Do not fly ever,1,"Tried Scoot once, shocking. Figured hey give them another chance and so much worse.
First time changed flights on us with little notice.
Second time paid for an upgrade, then todl unavailable. 4 months later still under investigation no refund."
Scoot,One extra 20kg luggage cost $1625,1,One extra 20kg luggage cost $1625. We thought it was a mistake since the rates published in their website are different. We wrote to customer service and they told us their agent can charge any amount. They do not adhere to their own published rate.
Scoot,Have flown scoot on 2 occasion recently…,4,"Have flown scoot on 2 occasion recently and have been pleasently suprised by the professionalism of the staff . Flight attendant's and counter staff very respectful
Advise when purchasing ticket pay for extra leg room well worth the expensive."
Scoot,Abusive: Scoot charges a change fee higher than the price of a new ticket.,1,"Hi! I have a booking from Chiang Mai to Singapore on Sunday November 17th at 12:00PM that cost 14,674.15THB.

I want to change to depart from Bangkok to Singapore on Wednesday November 20th at 18:35PM (flight TR611) which costs 2,900THB.

I called several times to no avail, and was told that I'd have to pay a change fee + booking fee of 3,165THB by Dayani from the Scoot Singapore Help Center.

It is absolutely unacceptable that Scoot charge me more than the price of a new flight, especially considering the fare difference of 11,774THB in scoot's favor. I do not expect a refund of the original flight, but I do expect a fee waiver (at least partially) considering that the original flight is MUCH more expensive than the new flight. I never expected this from a Singaporean company, especially associated to Singapore airlines, and have lost respect for the airline. This is abuse.

I have already submitted a help form with reference 241114757698."
Scoot,Customer service is shocking,1,"Customer service is shocking, Changed my flight times two weeks before I was due to fly. Tried to get a refund and they stated as its under 2hrs I cannot get a refund.
They just kept saying sorry but offered no assistance or alternative flights.
I should have read the reviews before booking with them. They are mostly awful. However its a lesson learned on my part.
Do not use them."

Asked a very simple straight forward online check in question to be given absolutely rubbish responses, very robotic and very slow to reply. Wasted 30 minutes to get no answers. 0 stars."
Scoot,Surprisingly good,5,"I flew from Singapore to Melbourne yesterday on Scoot and everything was fine. Bit of a hiccup with online check-in where an error message initially appeared on my phone, but I checked again on my laptop the next day and everything was fine. Very organized departure gate where the Scoot team clearly displayed the boarding order by group. Comfortable Boeing 787 airplane. Decent amount of legroom. It’s a budget airline so you get nothing for free, but hey that comes with the territory. Bought 2 noodle soups for $11 SGD during the flight. Flight crew was kind and attentive. Overall I was quite impressed, especially considering that these guys are half the price of everyone else."
Scoot,Worst airline ever in every aspect you can imagine,1,"worst airline ever, a bus in my neighborhood would've been better than this. chairs are super tight than usual flights, unless you're a very short person, and the chair i got can't go lay back at all. If you ask to them to jump to the empty chair near the exist they ask for money. Everything has a price starting from a sip of water to whatever else you can imagine. flight attendants are like zombies. company Policy is the worst in every aspect."
Scoot,Terrible.,1,"My recent experience with the airline was incredibly frustrating. They unilaterally changed my flight date after I had already booked, leaving me in a difficult situation. The lack of communication about this change showed a complete disregard for their passengers' time and plans. It's disappointing when an airline's actions undermine the trust and reliability that passengers should be able to expect."
Scoot,Dump Charles Taylor Aviation,1,"My luggage was not forwarded from Singapore to Makassar by Scoot. It arrived 6 days later.
Charles Taylor, handling the claims for expenses made, was terrible.
I am convinced that it is their business model to make claiming as difficult as possible. It took me 8 e-mails to 5 individuals, 3 forms, and 6 pictues to get a lousy USD 98 refunded. Mind you: I had everything well documented. One of the forms needed to be signed by a witness 'to prevent fraud'.
Processing time for payment is at least 3 months. I am still waiting.
Conclusion for Scoot: Dump Charles Taylor Aviation, they are a disgrace."

Scoot,Afraid after seeing all reviews here. But surprised!,5,"Afraid after seeing all reviews here.
But i got positively surprised flying from Saigon to Singapore. Staff at check in was incredibly friendly, gave me an emergency seat for free, very helpful because i had visa issues - directed me well to immigrations and quickly checked me in afterwards. During the flight very friendly staff - flight overall no complaints.
Hope this gives some hopes to people that have mixed feelings like me going into the flight :)"

SINGAPORE AIRLINES SHOULD KNOW BETTER
Scoot,The worst experience ever,1,The worst experience ever. Our flight from Berlin to Athens got cancelled just prior to checking in. The company did not take any responsibility for allocating us to different flights. We ended up losing hundreds of euros buying a ticket from a different company to arrive late at our destination. I AM NEVER FLYING WITH SCOOT AGAIN.
Scoot,Finger weg von Scoot - Zero customer care!,1,"We planed to fly from Berlin to Singapore (round trip) with Scoot in December but due to a medical emergency we had to cancel the trip.
Scoot agreed to issue ticket vouchers within 30 business days.
More than two month later no vouchers issued yet. Several calls with the hotline didn't result in any progress on the matter.
We are considering to open a lawsuit either in Germany or Singapore against Scoot.
Definately cannot recommend the Singapore Airlines budget airline ""Scoot"" to anyone."
Scoot,"They will screw you, even if it’s their fault",1,"Missed flight due to website error, I have evidence, and they refuse to help.

I was unable to download the boarding pass due to an error on their website, I checked in successfully but the button to download boarding pass simply didn’t download anything. At this point I panic and realize I have to make it to a desk, which I couldn’t find due to there being no office or help desk at Bangkok. And then by the time information can help me, they’ve closed the desk. I was relying on their website working, and since I had the problem, their customer service has been dismissive and horrible. They are the worst airline."
Scoot,Never take a Scoot flight,1,"Never take a Scoot flight, even if it is the most economical option. The airport staff were three impolite Indian girls who refused to allow us to board for a ridiculous reason. We had completed online check-in and received our boarding passes at home, but they denied us boarding because they expected my wife’s father’s name to be on her visa. because her father’s name is already on her passport. As a result, we missed our flight, hotel reservation, and travel to Vietnam. Interestingly, our friends, who faced a similar situation, were permitted to board."
Scoot,strongly recommend not using this airline,1,"Rated 0 out of 5 stars

strongly recommend not using this airline
I took a flight from Tokyo Narita, transiting through Singapore to Bali. Throughout the journey, there was a constant smell of urine in my seat area, and all the crew members were extremely RUDE.

We arrived at our destination over two hours late, and there was neither a monitor nor even a USB charger available.

I strongly recommend not using this airline.

Scoot,Absolute joke with Scoot...worst airlines,1,"Absolute joke with Scoot. My luggage arrived badly damaged with contents inside pierced through. Made complaint at the airport, asked to go through online complaint with report. And they are now trying to lowball liability with 20% claim refund. I will take them to Case and tribunal claims. This is daylight cheating. Against the international rules (Warsaw or Montreal) they have signed up for. And absolutely disrespectful to consumers. Shame on you SCOOT!! Don't fly Scoot - they need to learn a lesson that customers rights are enshrined in law! Disgusted!"
Scoot,The scammy version of the prestigious…,1,"The scammy version of the prestigious and much loved Singapore Airlines. They are GUARANTEED to fail and frustrate and disappoint you at every turn. ADVISE: PAY MORE AND FLY ON A REAL AIRLINE. ""Budget"" airline means trouble, headache, extra expenses, losses and BIG HIDDEN COSTS. They are beggarly enough to charge you for a blanket on an international flight. They will NOT allow excess baggage except at this rate: $50 per kg , which means extra 20 kg bag costs $1000. *SCAM* RUN , SWIM OR WALK BUT DO NOT FLY ON THIS TRASH AIRLINE."
Scoot,delay-very short notice. bad for toddler travel unhelpful,1,"wouldnt allow stroller in cabin. despite singapore airlines allowing us. delayed flight - announced 2 hrs before flight. had to rebook connecting flight with 2 yr old 7hrs layover instead of 1.5. spoke to representative on phone- unable to help - advised to call singapore airlines instead for connecting flight.
ground staff and flight crew could not agree with esch other trying to pass responsibility between each other.

Scoot,Worst experience ever,1,"Worst experience ever.
Departing flight was originally schedule for 6pm from Perth to Singapore
However received sms in the morning saying the flight has been reschedule to 8.30pm depart . However the flight doesn’t take off until 9.30pm and we reached spore 2.30am midnight

Staffs are so unprofessional
Return flight was originally schedule 12pm depart from Singapore to Perth
No advance notice this time.
At 11.15am when the boarding gate open we were told they have changed the boarding gate from one end of the terminal to the other end singapore Changi airport is huge
So the total distance from one gate to that assigned gate was about 15mins walk

Anyway the original flight was schedule for 12pm and the plane doesn’t take off until 2pm
Terrible experience"
Scoot,You get what you pay for,3,"I mean, it’s a low cost eh, i really dont know what people expect.
It’s like ryanair but for longer flights, like a bus from 1980, and you have to pay extra for everything (if it works) but flight to bangkok was 200$ so i guess i got what i paid for. Also staff was as nice as can be, people wanna be treated as if it was luxury when paying for lowcost, adjust your expectations. Overall I am pleased, but i wish i knew they dont take electronic payment and that you have to pay for electricity"
Scoot,Probably the worst flight of my life,1,"Probably the worst flight of my life. The airline would not accept my Mastercard or AMEX card for any onboard payments, but would refuse to serve me any water on the flight without paying for it. So I had no water on an 8 hour flight as I could not even pay for it. Maybe its not illegal (though it should be), its definitely inhumane."
Scoot,I’ve booked a round trip between HK-SG,1,"I’ve booked a round trip between HK-SG; when I was at the airport for the return trip. The previously booked flight simply doesn’t exist! The counter staff has zero clue and just said it could’ve changed to a different departing time. But I never received any email or SMS regarding the change

I had to buy another one way ticket back to HK for more than double the money I spent on the original round trip.

Absolutely terrible service
Absolutely"
Scoot,My best Scoot experience,5,My best Scoot experience by far was this return flight from Osaka to Sg TR819. The crew was great - friendly and served well. Special mention goes to Rihin who helped my family of 3 sit together in a row when we were actually all disbursed at separate seats and found my jacket too! Thank you Rihin! 👍👍👍
Scoot,Thanks scoot for the foul holiday mood,1,"Thanks scoot, you cancelled and rescheduled my flight from 0855hrs to 1825hrs which was a packed flight, gave me the furthermost back row seats and the best part - further delayed till 1900hr+. I'm fuming and still waiting on the tarmac. Thanks for ruining my holiday plans and other bookings. And your ground staff won't assure me of an official written confirmation of this change so that I have proof to produce in my travel insurance claim for this 10 hour delay. A simple letter to just say that the flight was changed. What gives? As a Singaporean, this is ridiculously tedious and disappointing"
Scoot,Scoot cancelled the second leg of a…,1,"Scoot cancelled the second leg of a trip from Singapore, leaving us stranded 1000 miles from our final destination or paying 4 times more fore getting to our destination in proper time. Cancellation was within 1 week from take off and they didn’t allow us to cancel the first leg. Refund for the second leg trip has not been paid yet (5+weeks ago).

Horrible excuse for a company. Should be illegal to run these kind of sham companies in the civilized world."
Scoot,DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM,1,"If I could put -5* I would believe me!! This Singaporean airline is hands down the worst airline ever..! I booked a flight on August 26th, 2023 and everything that could go wrong did. Because of their poor service and an overbooking issue, I was unable to catch a connection flight, for which I had to spend an extra 400€. After trying to connect with them many times, it’s obvious this airline is a joke. Make yourself a favor, stay as far as posible from their low cost services, you’ll end up pay more!!!"
Scoot,I’m convinced that the only existence…,1,"I’m convinced that the only existence of scoot is to make other airlines look good.

- Unable to get visa due to COVID-19 regulations - refuse to process refund
- flight always gets rescheduled and retimed
- flight cancelled, no communication on what happened, no confirmation on replacement flight until last minute

You get what you pay for? Maybe, their tickets aren’t exactly the cheapest. Buyer beware. I have never come across a company that hates its customers so much, have so little empathy for them, and care so little for them."
Scoot,Rebooking more costly than total write-off & rebook,1,"Price is higher than Singapore Air & Silkair used to be unless booking ~6 weeks ahead.

And when things change: NO REFUND and no options but take the hit because changing the original ticket yields a price that is MORE expensive than scrapping original without refund & buying a new one.

So be prepared for NO flexibilty at normal/high price"
Scoot,Never fly Scoot,1,"Unfortunately, I had stomach bug and symptoms started during the flight, which led to frequent vomiting and trips to the bathroom. I let the staff know and requested to sit near the toilet so I wouldn’t disturb others and for my own convenience, but the crew refused to allow this.

I requested a Coke to help settle my stomach after I had ran out of my water, but I had to wait over an hour and asked five times. Each time I asked, they said it would be “ok” or ""one moment"" then proceeded to walk away and completely ignore my request. It was very odd for someone to say one thing, then act completely differently multiple times. Despite not really being able to stand, I eventually had to walk up to get it myself from the trolley, and then they made me pay for it. They even charge for water. They also refused to give me ice to go with my overpriced, warm water. Instead I was given a sassy response as if what I was asking for was unreasonable.

It’s also ridiculous that no food or water is provided on an 8-hour flight unless purchased. At Singapore airport, the security is right before the gate, so there’s no way to purchase drinks for the flight before hand.

The lack of care shown was unacceptable. After being bed bound for a week and doctors visit, it turns out I had Gastroenteritis. Luckily, my situation wasn’t more serious because I can’t imagine how they’d handle a real emergency—they’d likely ignore it too. Without a doubt, this was the worst and strangest customer service I’ve ever experienced. Never fly scoot."
Scoot,Horrible Experience with Scoot Airline Flight TR002 - depart 2am from singapore- Avoid,1,"I recently flew from Singapore to Sydney on Scoot Airline (Flight TR002) (PNR UH8WME) at 2 AM on the 22nd of sep, 2024, and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I was assigned seat 29C, which was right next to the washroom door. The smell from the washroom was unbearable as people were constantly using it throughout the flight, making it impossible to breathe or even rest. The noise from the flushing was loud and persistent, adding to the discomfort.

To make matters worse, despite seeing many empty seats, I politely asked the cabin crew if I could switch seats. Their response was not only dismissive but outright rude. One of the staff members told me I couldn’t change seats because ""it’s not our airline."" Excuse me? What kind of answer is that?

The crew was bossy and unhelpful, and the overall attitude felt like they couldn’t care less about passengers’ comfort or concerns. This level of service is unacceptable, especially on a long flight. I wouldn’t recommend Scoot to anyone.if you value your comfort and a decent flying experience, look elsewhere! WTH Scoot!"
Scoot,Just DON'T book this airline,1,"Just DON'T book this airline. One of the worst experiences... first our flight from bali to singapore was postponed several times... than our flight was 1h to late. Although we managed to arrive on time on our connectingflights gate, they booked us on another flight, without telling us. Unprofessional, unfriendly and untrained staff"
Scoot,Awful customer Services,1,"booked a flight with Scoot then booked Luggage at a later date, wont let me check in because they have refused my payment. tried several times but they keep declining me. spoke to at least 5 different customer service agents that keep telling me the same thing and noting is working, they then proceed to tell me to expect a call in the next 72hrs but i hear nothing from them. this has been going on for roughly a month. Shambolic. 0 stars"
Scoot,Scoot has terrible rebooking fees,1,"Scoot has terrible rebooking fees
They say they dont change rebooking fees except fare difference, but what they dont say is that they charge spoilage fees, you will end up paying more than if you just book another flight. Just really terrible."
Scoot,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!,1,"I will never use this airline again the customer service is abysmal. My flight was delayed from Bali to Singapore by over 4hours so I missed my connecting flights back to the UK. In Singapore I was forced to pay SGD800 to buy new flights home.
When I reported this to Scoot I got several generic responses saying I am not entitled to any compensation because I made my flights which I did not. They have taken absolutely no responsibility for their incompetence.
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!"
Scoot,Truly horrendous airline,1,"Truly horrendous airline. They have the nerve to charge extra for having a *headrest* on a 13 hour flight, in addition to prohibiting you from bringing your own water or snacks. This goes above and beyond any other budget carrier and reveals an unparalleled level of greed and contempt for their customers. Also, of course, the flight was delayed."
Scoot,I would give 0 stars if I could,1,"I would give 0 stars if I could. I have flown with various airlines over the years and never made a complaint. However, Scoot has motivated me to join the rather long list of incredibly bad reviews and I would like to add my opinion that they are indeed terrible. Scoot changed my layover from 2 hours to 21 hours, the day after I purchased a ticket. No worries, I contacted customer support. Absoultely useless and to add on to that quite rude. While the tickets may seem relatively cheap please save yourself the headache and pay a little extra to fly with a competent airline. Thanks."
Scoot,Flew to Singapore,4,"Flew to Singapore, good price, planes nice and new and ran on time. Flight attendants friendly. Didn't have any issues with the seat sizes. My only qualm was their bizarre rule that you can't eat any food or drink you bought at the airport on the plane. Pretty stupid. Other than that fine for a very cheap airline, will fly again if they keep the prices low."
Scoot,Lost bag hopeless customer service,1,Lost bag hopeless customer service ! I only booked Singapore as they fly direct to gold coast - big mistake ! Ok they are a budget airline so I can put up with ultra slow on-board service [ 3 hours to get meal and drink ] 7 hours flifht no entertainment screen but when my bag went missing with several others - I'm now into day 4 several phone calls no resolution other to send me another list bag from another poor soul ! Can't get any customer service in Australia have to ring Singapore ! Might be budget but please remember you get what you pay for so if you want cheap but nasty go Scoot !
Scoot,They re-scheduled a flight for another…,1,"They re-scheduled a flight for another day, causing me to lose my connection flights with other airlines. I had to buy new connection flights. Additionally, I had to live for more than a day at Changi airport because they wouldn't pay for a hotel. They have not paid absolutely nothing of the damages they have caused. They said there was a strike at the destination airport, but that strike was called off by a judge a day before the scheduled flight. Complaint number 230913337430"
Scoot,overall opinion,3,"well i’d say scoot was proven to be a lot better than shown on the reviews. the food was nice ( id give it a try) also the seats were comfier than most airlines, the downside tho is that you are not able to consume your own food on the plane which is very annoying and also having no screen for such a long flight really makes it hard. i would definitely make sure you have something to occupy yourself with otherwise it’ll be a very boring flight but overall i’d say wasn’t terrible like other reviews."
Scoot,Inhuman,5,"With reference 240213756985 my husband suffers a heart attack and is admitted to the hospital for several months. We sent the reports to the company, and they gave us a voucher, which only he can use. Now we are on the waiting list for a transplant and still we They ask for confidential reports to know when they discharge him. It could be more inhumane. I just ask them to give me another voucher so that another person can use it since he cannot travel."
Scoot,The worst airline and I have flown with…,1,"The worst airline and I have flown with many. I usually fly with mainstream airlines. Should fast Vietnam to Europe. This company was the fastest and the price was the same From Ho Chi Minh to Singapore. The service was non-existent. The departure gate that was given didn't match where it was, chaos. The staff spoke very poor English, there was no free drink item or anything else. Overall, it was a very bad experience and for the price I could have chosen Thai Air, which is a great company"
Scoot,Avoid at all costs,1,"Avoid at all costs. Wow. first time I've ever had a company refuse to make any accommodations. Low budget airline = no customer service!! The website is atrocious, poor layout, slow page load times and had to reload pages several times (no issues on other websites). Took me well over an hour to book my flight with their flex ticket because I thought I'd need to make changes. Sure enough, had to change flight date, made changes on website and thought all was well. Downloaded the app 2 weeks later and it said I needed to make a payment. Website didn't show anything and I hadn't received any emails or other notices. Did a WhatsApp chat only to be told I'd only purchased travel insurance and not a flex ticket so had to pay the change fees.

Absolutely no flexibilty, no discount, no communication, and awful awful website!!"
Scoot,Didn’t allow to me board,1,I was slightly delayed from a previous flight which wouldn’t have been an issue but scoot decided to close there the check in an hour before the flight left. This made me miss the flight from Berlin to off to Australia and then resulted in me having book and pay for all new flights. So thank you so much for the massive inconvenience that you didn’t need to cause.
Scoot,Never fly this airline,1,Never fly this airline. Every step in both directions was a nightmare and ultimately cost us an extra €600 in rebooking and baggage fees. They changed the departure time and closed the check in early with NO customer service for rebooking and we were among 20+ passengers who missed the flight with no recourse.
Scoot,SCOOT - WORST AIRLINE DON'T USE AT ALL COSTS,1,"(1) Zero customer contact for customers living in Europe outside of Greece + Germany. (2) Live Chat is actually not live at all - it is just a bot that repeats the same formula over and over again ad nauseam. (3) They make so many changes that dump your original (and paid for )booking. (4) They provide a minimal voucher to rebook with, that must be used within 24hrs, with less than 24hrs notice. (5) Their ""Customer service"" is astoundingly disgraceful.

I cannot wait to never have to fly with them again. Be warned - they are a partner airline for Singapore Airlines."
Scoot,Why is Singapore Airlines managed by Scoot?????,1,The entire site for managing your booking seems to be “experiencing high traffic” every time you try to access it. I booked a long haul flight from Taipei to AMS with Singapore Airlines and was surprised to see that their management of the flight was managed by this horrible company called Scoot. I’ve been trying for 3 days to manage my booking etc to no avail. Will be calling SIngapore Air soon directly.
Scoot,Should have listened to the experience of others before booking.,1,Like most airlines they're very happy to take your money but not great at dealing with issues or providing refunds promptly. Had to cancel a booking due to medical reasons and despite sending all the information they would need to provide a refund they're still going around in circles. The same info I might add that I provided to another international airlines who acted and refunded swiftly within days. 3 weeks in and still waiting on Scoot to refund.
Scoot,This airline is utter garbage,1,"This airline is utter garbage. I cannot find one thing about the entire experience that wasn't appalling. I'm not even complaining about the price, I chose it, and I paid for Scoot Plus, but everything from their customer service, to their planes, the the seats, and ridiculous lateness on a red eye, to their rude and obnoxious flight attendants. What a horrible company with horrible employees."
Scoot,0 star service,1,"I could not give 0 stars it seems and 1 is far too generous. I have been chasing Scoot for answers since 06/01/2023, when they left me stranded at Kuching airport, Malaysia (Booking ref: HDPZVK). I stood at check-in for nearly 2 hours as their leaderless, idiotic staff tried to find a way to check my bag in. They could only do this online apparently and their system had been down all afternoon, as I had discovered when booking just a few hours earlier. An argument ensued and when I took photos of the check-in area for my complaint, they refused further attempts to check me in. I am still fighting for a refund and compensation for my unused hotel in Bali. Avoid Scoot."
Scoot,Very poor Customer service / website,1,"Horrible website, said the payment wasn't processed, went ahead and booked with another credit card where it confirmed it did work - However then ended up getting charged 2 times. Talking to customer service they are nice enough to give a refund, but will charge a $50 refund fee.... (Unless I have a screenshot of the declined payment, which no one ever saves)"
Scoot,I feel sorry for the staff,1,"I get this is a budget airline but it felt like the staff were incompetent and struggled to make basic decisions about whether or not I could move seats, although there were two full rows free behind me. Felt like they were unconfident and I’ll-equipped as cabin crew. They need more training and support. This will also help with things like productivity."
Scoot,"From A to B for a cheap price. Nothing more, nothing less.",5,"I had 3 trips so far and all went well.
Book directly on their website. Its so intuitive and easy, you get a proper receipt and booking confirmation right away.
They dont provide water so buy water before embarking the flight like any normal person would. Maybe wear a sweater since it could be cold at night.
With scoot you get from A to B for the cheapest price on the market. Nothing more, nothing less."
Scoot,Unethical pricing and poor management,1,"Poor service recovery, ground and chat support.

Twice I’ve made FULL payments for my Melbourne flights and my Hong Kong flights on different occasions and AFTER PAYMENTS the system prompts outstanding payments which the support team CANNOT EXPLAIN.

The system insist that I pay the outstanding or else I can’t check in.

The authorities NEED to investigate this “scam” like malicious practice ASAP.

This happened twice. It suggest a lower change fare and latter hit you with more charges after flights are changed.

It’s unethical pricing practice.

I will escalate this to the authorities with supporting documents."
Scoot,Changed my flight from 4pm to 8am…,1,Changed my flight from 4pm to 8am without proper notice. Their customer service was extremely rude and unwilling to offer any kind of help or possible solution. In all my years I have never experienced an airline this horrible. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this airline.
Scoot,Appalling,1,"Appalling. Delayed then left us stranded without any support in Singapore airport. Staff were arrogant, rude and generally dismissive. Whole experience was incredibly stressful. Trying to apply for compensation has been next to impossible. Have had to resort yo lawyers. Avoid."
Scoot,Dont bother with Scoot. Nothing near seamless yet they still preach it,1,"If you have a choice, DO NOT CHOOSE SCOOT, especially if you are a Singaporean. I had been subjected to documents check for my last 7 consecutive flights on Scoot out bound from Singapore. I hold Singapore passport and travelling out of Singapore and I am subjected to document checks which creates a great hassle and delay in getting through customs and immigration. I asked and the uninterested replies ""it is random"". I askeed how could it be random if it has been 7 times consecutively, no response. I emailed the airline direct and it is just silence from them for more than one year. Typical pompous Singapore Airlines treatment. I used to be frequent flyer with SIA but the standard has gone down the drain. My go to airline now is Emirates"
Scoot,Cancelled our flight within last few days,1,"Cancelled our flight within last few days of flight with no compensation
Cancelled our flight with no phone call or anything. Apparently they sent us an email. We never got any. Have to rebook a covid pcr test and hotel again. Spoke to customer service so at least give us some compensation like a add a bag for us or pay for our covid test. But staff was very adamant. Basically implied to just pay it again and live with it. Do not use this airline again. Apparently cancellation of flights is regular occurrence with this airline. So book at your own risk and just pay a bit more with reputable airline"

Scoot,Absolutely everything is wrong with…,1,"Absolutely everything is wrong with this company.

Used them for our main travel to and from SE Asia. Expensive, even for a budget airline and NOTHING, even water, came included. Crammed in like sardines with nowhere to move, absolutely awful.

Then on a flight between countries we were given the run around by one of their service representatives, causing us to miss the check in deadline by 2 minutes (put us in the wrong queue twice) and then was treated appallingly because of ‘being late’. We could prove otherwise but they were not interested and wouldn’t let us through. Disgusting service.

Then, after putting in TWO complaints… we never hear back from the company.

Disgusting. Awful. DO NOT USE."
Scoot,Avoid Avoid Avoid,1,"Scoot airlines. They sound OK, operating out of Singapore. But, no. their app simply does not work. My reference was not recognised so that was futile. I discovered upon checking-in that )without notifying me) Scoot had operational issues and cancelled my flight leaving me stranded at Singapore overnight without accommodation. They would not assist with booking accommodation and their refund will take, quote, '30 business days (that's 6 weeks in laymans terms) to be returned to me. So they take my money instantly upon booking a flight and then to add insult to injury will take 6 weeks before I get my money back. I would say it's likely I'll need to chase them when the refund fails to appear in the promised timescale. As I say, avoid avoid avoid."
Scoot,NEVER AGAIN,1,"This is by far, the worst airline I’ve flown with.

Tiny seats, you pay for everything including water on long haul flights, the service is terrible and I can’t believe they’re allowed to fly.

I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you’re prepared to be very uncomfortable and ripped off."
Scoot,"Short-haul good, long-haul terrible",2,"I flew to legs with Scoot. The first from SGN to SIN, which was good, no complaints here.

My second flight was from Singapore to Berlin via Athens. During the stopp in Athens, the plane couldn't start it's right engine so technicians came on board plus the plane had to taxi somewhere else. After some hours of waiting, they made as deboard the plane and had to cancel the flight. All of that is fine, I understand that safety goes first.

But this is where my dissatisfaction kicks in. They handed us a sheet of paper on how we can get refunded and ... that's basically it. No alternative transportation, no food, no drinks, no information - nothing. So now you have hundreds of lost passengers at the airport of Athens with nowhere to go, as the soonest flight to Berlin from any airlines would be the next day at horribly high prices.

I am now still waiting for my refund and compensation, being 19 days after I sent them my details. Left me standing in the middle of nowhere and haven't even paid or supported in any other way - that is unacceptable. Short-haul flights are fine, don't bother to fly anything further away."
Scoot,What an experience!,1,"In over 6 years of long distance flights I never came across such a terrible flying experience. Firstly was charged £100 for 5kg buggage overweight that included my warm clothes that I needed to wear entering a cold country. The plane was old and sits were terrible. After 12 hours of flight walked off with back and neck pains. Everything onboard have to be paid for even water. WiFi is so poor that, didn't even load a page. No entertainment at all. Someone who likes to travel with a minimal comfort should not get any close to this company!"
Scoot,We tried to change our tickets as we…,1,We tried to change our tickets as we have paid for multi flex ticket. The help line said no refund but pay the difference plus booking fee yes know problem. But it’s charging us the full amount again no help from help desk
Scoot,"Avoid, otherwise you'll regret it",1,"Honestly, I don't know why we keep doing this to ourselves, we took Scoot twice in the past year, and just booked for next year, yet each time it's plagued with issues, from booking missing information, a discount that was supposed to be applied and disappeared ""magically"" when the payment is taken. This is in addition to really poorly built mobile and desktop apps. Can't wait for other airlines to pick-up and start covering more routes in the region so we can avoid Scoot properly going forward!"
Scoot,Lost my luggage on my honeymoon,1,"Lost my luggage on my honeymoon, not responding to compensation emails. I went 4 days without a bag in a part of Bali where it was difficult to find essentials. It's been months and they've still not provided an update on compensation my travel insurance will not cover anything until the airline has responded. Avoid at all costs."
Scoot,Scoot airline bad,1,Scoot airline bad. We had a flight in May but we haven't received our luggage yet. We have emailed many times but received no response. worst airline I've seen
Scoot,Very good service from Scoot!!,5,I've read a large number of negative reviews about Scoot on various forums and was very concerned about our flight with them from Hong Kong to Singapore with a connecting flight onto Saigon with Singapore Airways. However my concerns were unfounded and I couldn't fault them in their service. Prior to travelling they kept me updated on the change in flight time and checking in at HK was easy with friendly staff. The flight itself was comfortable and although there is no on-board entertainment or food (unless purchased) this did not concern us too much for a 4 hr flight. The only negative for me was that their website is quite slow and clunky. However I was impressed with Scoot and would definitely use them again.
Scoot,Probably the worst airline in the world,1,"I hope this airline goes bankrupt and ceases to exist which they will if they continue to treat people the way they do. Their customer service is basically nonexistent and everything they tell you are lies. I recommend anyone reading this to book a flight with another airline if there is one. If there's not, don't book a ticket at all. I wish I could give 0 stars."
Scoot,This airline is an absolute cheek,1,"This airline is an absolute cheek. Flight times are constantly changed - there are no sensible alternatives to accepting the new flight conditions. No online check-in possible, but be there 2 hours earlier etc etc. It is sickening."
Scoot,Fly to the other side of the world with zero luggage!,1,"Scam company!

The conditions state that 20 kg checked in luggage is included in Economy class. Well....

That is just untill you stand at the counter, and suddently you have to pay 300 $ for your luggage because of ""special conditions"". And when you reject, they just say ""then find another company"".

First time going from Tokyo to Berlin, where no baggage is included. Their website is wildly misleading with their secret ""special conditions"". Who travels half way around the world with no luggage? I have been flying 50+ times in my life, and this is the worst experience I have had. Stay away!"
Scoot,Cheap Airline can COST a LOT,1,"Booked a flight to Thailand in January for April and Never received a confirmation email or anything to do with my flights, I messaged them through their website and after 10 emails back and forth and asking for a refund each time they just completely ignored me. Now I have lost $500 to the worst airline in history and I will never get it back. Something needs to be done!!!"
Scoot,Low low budget carrier,1,"e booked our flights through our travel agent who recommended Singapore Airlines. This was looking good until we got an email saying our flight had regrettably been changed and was now a Scoot flight. We thought it couldn't be that bad let's give it a try. However after getting on, the seats are very uncomfortable with little room, and are from the 1980s. No entertainment screens etc unless you pay more. It wasn't until our connecting flight to London that we realised how poor Scoot was on comparison to Singapore Airlines. If you ever get changed for Scoot ask for your money back or another flight, I feel completely ripped off by Singapore airlines by getting changed to this low cost airline. I guess fair enough if you book for a cheap cheap price, you'll know what to expect.
I'll never fly Scoot again.

Scoot,4 Times my wrost flight,1,"I have flown with Scoot 4 times in 1 and a half years, and there hasn’t been a single occasion where I was satisfied.
Every flight turned out to be a disaster from every point of view. The first time, the flight from Malaysia to Australia departed with over an hour of delay. The second time, while returning from Australia to Italy, I took a flight from Perth to Kuala Lumpur with over 3 HOURS of delay, causing me to miss ALL my subsequent connections. You can imagine the chaos that followed.
The third time, from the Philippines to Singapore, the flight was delayed by more than half an hour. And as if that wasn’t enough, the last experience, just a day later, from Singapore to Perth, started with over an hour of delay.

Even though the flight from Singapore to Perth was operated with a Boeing 787, a large and modern aircraft, there wasn’t even a port to charge your phone. BUT HEY! They have rainbow lights and electronically dimmable windows! What progress!

It’s embarrassing that an airline operating international flights doesn’t provide basic services, especially considering that these routes often last more than 6-12 hours. But this is just the beginning of the problems.

The cabin crew is consistently extremely rude and incompetent, to the point that it seems like they hate this company as much as the passengers do. There’s absolutely no attention to customer service, and their attitude makes the flight experience even more frustrating.

Despite the constant delays, Scoot offers nothing to compensate for the inconvenience. Don’t expect even a glass of juice or a bottle of water as a courtesy gesture. Everything is paid for. The cabin air is so dry that you constantly hear people coughing. There’s no Wi-Fi onboard, no port to charge your phone (if you want one, you have to pay, of course).
They operate INTERCONTINENTAL flights lasting up to 15 hours and offer no entertainment whatsoever—not even a shared screen.

Even low-cost airlines like Philippine Airlines, which operates routes as short as 45 minutes, provide a bottle of water and a small snack. The same goes for Air France on very short flights, like Bologna-Paris, where they give you a fruit juice and a biscuit. Scoot, on the other hand, behaves worse than the cheapest low-cost airline out there.

The seats are uncomfortable, and there isn’t even a pocket to store your personal belongings.
There’s absolutely no RESPECT for passengers.
This airline is an insult to anyone who decides to fly with them, even though their tickets aren’t cheap enough to justify such poor quality.

As far as I’m concerned, I will never fly with Scoot again. I’d rather spend more and travel with an airline that respects its customers and provides at least a decent service. I sincerely hope this company goes out of business because the level of incompetence and lack of professionalism they demonstrate is truly disgraceful."
Scoot,No refund,1,"In April this year, I booked a flight with Scoot for August. 3 weeks prior to my flight it got cancelled and Scoot offered me a refund. Four months later, after multiple emails and phone calls, they still haven't refunded me. Terrible company with terrible and rude customer service, I would not recommend it to anyone."
Scoot,Scoot engageScoot's Unsavory Business Practices and Legal Recourses in unsavory business…,1,"Scoot engages in unsavory business practices and they try very hard to deny a refund even though I did not get the front row seat which I paid for. Apparently, there was an aircraft change and they did not change my seat at check in or at the boarding gate.
When I proved beyond doubt that they screw up, they finally offered to refund, by asking you to acknowledge the offer; of course hoping that you will decline.
If you have legal grounds to file a claim against Scoot, you can file the claim through Small Claims Tribunals which is part of Singapore Courts. There is a very small fee to pay. Documents are filed through a portal and consultation sessions are done on a online platform. This makes it very convenient. Judgements are binding."
Scoot,Terrible customer service,1,Terrible customer service. They are not held to the same standards as US or EU airlines - I made a mistake when booking and realized it within 10 minutes. I went to modify the booking only to see a change fee and that the price of all flights went up exponentially. No option to cancel the flight. I reached out to customer service and they had no sympathy even though I realized the mistake within 10 minutes. Will not book with them again.
Scoot,BEWARE,1,"BEWARE: Flew with them from Bangkok-London on 26/07/22, we boarded the flight and after an hour of waiting to take off. Was told to leave the aircraft, and after two hours of waiting around, they then told us we would have to wait another 12 hours for the next flight, due to an issue with the aircraft. The airport staff were disorganised and didn't have a clue what to do, and there was no sufficient compensation. All they offered was a B500 baht voucher that needed to be used within 3 hours! Customer service was non-existent, and they refused to compensate accordingly for the delays! Flying with Scoot is quite possibly the worst experience I've ever had with an airline. There are some pretty poor flights and airlines I've encountered, but Scoot is amongst the worst."
Scoot,Scoot is no frills with a vengeance!,3,"Scoot is a budget air line so ok on short hops but a trial on anything longer than 4 hrs
There is no in flight entertainment, you pay for everything even water, but what would you expect
Web site is v poor surprising as Singapore air ( owner) is so good
Fair on bags etc you get what you pay for"
Scoot,Scam company,1,"Scam company. Don't fall for their tricks. You will end up paying more for your luggage than you did for the whole ticket. And if they lose your luggage, which their famous for, you won't get any compensation or help retrieving it whatsoever."
Scoot,Scoot are crapola,1,"Scoot are crapola! What a disgrace to Singapore Airlines. If I were Singapore Airlines, I’d disassociate now before they’re sued & they drag you down with them. What an embarrassment to aviation"
Scoot,Overacharged for Inflight Food- still waiting for refund 4 months later,1,"Overall a fine flight experience. The worst part of flying with Scoot was that I was overcharged $70 on my in flight purchase and have been chasing this up since October last year. I have had no updates (not a single email or phone call) sent to me about the status of refund, the customer service team show no skill at fixing this issue and the last staff member I spoke to over the phone had an attitude and was completely unhelpful. Apparently there was also a problem with the process as they didnt have the cardholders name and I only found out about this through multiple calls to them. Fine to fly with but I wouldnt wish try to chase up any issues with them on my worst enemy. Would not recommend. Worst customer service experience and problem resolution I've ever had."
Scoot,Never again!,1,"Never again! Over promised and under delivered. Found out at check in, my 2 teenage kids were downgraded to economy despite having bought scootplus tickets for them in advance 6 months earlier. Worst, at scoot check in countet, they promised SGD150 voucher per person and refund of difference in economy and scootplus ticket price or 30% of ticket price whichever is higher but failed to honor this after we landed back in Singapore. We called customer service but they just ask us to check our emails but never came through with a email notification of the refund and voucher. An airline that has no integrity and professionalism shouldn’t be operating from Singapore giving SQ and Singapore such a bad image!"
Scoot,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,1,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS

Flight got cancelled 2 hours before take-off.
5 months later I was still not refunded. No chance to reach them. Their website is a complete joke.

They should be investigated for fraudulent business practice."
Scoot,Can’t be trusted. Not legit!,1,I just booked with Scoot and I paid $34 extra to get a refundable airline ticket just in case I change my mind or something happens. My ticket was only $54 so $34 was a bit pricey. Now 6 days bf my flight I asked to cancel and get my refund. Scoot told me they won’t give me a refund unless I had a medical emergency. They never told me that bf I paid the extra money incase I needed to cancel. Now my flight is cancelled and I lost all my money. How can they do that to their customers? Just look at all their reviews and that will tell you everything.
Scoot,Horrible Check-In Experience at Singapore Changi Airport,1,"We had a horrible and thoroughly unpleasant experience checking in for a Scoot flight (TR180 Singapore to Nanjing on 19 Feb 2024) at Singapore Changi Airport.

We had already checked in online, and arrived at the airport to collect physical boarding passes and drop-off luggage.

When we arrived, we were unable to print the boarding passes at the automated stations and approached several counter staff for help. Instead of assisting us, we were repeatedly told to ""just queue"".

However, when we reached the front of the queue, we were told that check in for our flight had closed and refused to let us board. They referred us to another counter, where we were blamed for not approaching them earlier and were again refused boarding.

We finally escalated the issue to a manager, who realised that we had already checked in online and needed to get to the gate quickly for boarding. We rushed over and made our flight.

Although we made our flight, our Scoot experience was a complete nightmare. The counter staff were unhelpful, unpleasant and in desperate need of proper training. Please save yourself the headache and find another airline."
Scoot,Do not book with Scoot on Skyscanner,1,"Do not bother booking with Scoot on Skyscanner
We tried to book flights to Australia that were advertised for £543
Too good to be true
Yes it was
You then try to book and your transferred to a booking page we’re the price has nearly doubled and a company called DOHOP are charging you a booking fee and will cover you for what the airline should already cover you for!

Mis advertising and misleading

Do you’re background research
Not worth the risk"
Scoot,"No drink, no food for 7+ hours",1,"I travelled with a transfer, and the first flight lasted for 7+ hours. I didn't bring drink, food and anything, because I thought that for such a long flight they would serve something. I couldn't even buy a drink, because my bank card was packed deep in my cabin baggage (my economy class ticket didn't include personal item on the plane) and it would have been difficult to take it out, open the hard cover baggage and search for my card. By the end of the flight I was just concentrating on not fainting from dehydration. Awful experience.
Besides that, their website is very s.h.i.t.t.y. It looks like developed by r.e.t.a.r.d.e.d people and on phone I couldn't reach some options when managing booking."
Scoot,Never use this company!,1,"Never use this company!

They changed my flight dates on a flight with return from Berlin to Tokyo, I did not accept the change and opted for the refund as all the dates had changed.

I have now been waiting over 6 months for the refund, customer support is useless and repeats the same robotic info, I will never use last minute again!

2000 euros they have robbed from me"
Scoot,Racist!!!,1,I should have checked all the negative reviews. First and last time I use this company. Racist and incompetent employee made me pay 130 euros extra and checked the bills one by one after I had to withdraw from the ATM machine.
Scoot,Worse. Experience. Ever.,1,"I decided to switch from Jetstar to scoot, thought better as it's with SQ. NOPE.
They changed my flight, didn't give another option. Been trying to contact them, no easy way... OR ANY way. Stay away.
Clearly an airline run by chimpanzees who happen to be able to tap tap tap on the keyboard, that's all.
And as you all can read from the reviews here: customers are frustrated. Scoot doesn't care."
Scoot,Shocking scam by Scoot…,1,"This is a shocking scam by Scoot Airlines.
Recommendation, do not fly with them.

Note: We have not yet flown on this flight
I fly budget due to my income level. Just that.

I booked and paid for the flight in mid November for my wife and I. (Confirmation received) I paid extra for the flexible booking option so I wouldn't lose too much money, as my wife's visa hadn't arrived. USD $116.

A few days later worried about the visa timing, I tried to reschedule her flight to a few weeks later. That dates price was USD $4 lower than the original booking price. I was not worried about getting that $4 back. Not important.
But the Scoot website and the app were not working correctly so it recommended I go to the live chat. Which I did and  it constantly reminded me not to click away or the chat would end. So I was unable to verify what I was being told during that chat. The person ""Nab"" told he could do it all for me but at the end said the charges would be -USD $272.50. Did the price go down from $311.20? There was no other option. So I had to except.

Afterwards I checked the cost of the flight and found they had overcharged me the $272.50.
Calling back they gave multiple excuses (probably legal) but morally repulsive. It seems to me that they were only there to rip me off for as much as possible.
Complaints and multiple emails back and forth they have still not admitted their incompetence and disgusting service.
It seems impossible to have a rational, commonsense,  logical dialogue with them. I just constantly receive incompetence and lack of service.
Unlike all other airlines, for Scoot, flexible does not mean flexible."
Scoot,Worst airline,1,"Flight was severely delayed - 5 hours. Arrived at Changi airport at 4am. We missed our connecting flight.

Gave out $30 card at 5am and asked us come back again at 10am to check if we can fly at 3pm, but not guaranteed.

Travelled with kid, we haven’t slept for whole night.

Disappointed. I am puzzled all help they can extend is giving out $30 card to buy food and informing that we must check with the shops before making purchase as some shops don’t accept it due to machine not working.

I am now sitting at Changi Airport, writing this review. Tired, sleepy and hungry….stuck in a foreign land airport…"
Scoot,Consistently poor experience,1,"What a truly horrible airline. They go out of their way to deliver an unpleasant experience everytime - they are very consistent about it. Complaining to them, or even escalating to senior management makes no difference at all - they just dont care."
Scoot,Terrible service from the crew during…,1,"Terrible service from the crew during the flight TR391 on 2nd of February 2024. The aircon was way to cold, i asked the staff if I could take clothes in my hand bag to get warmer. They put my bag in an other closet and they couldn't find it. I did then ask a blanket in compensation as it s not my fault if I can't find my bag. They asked me to pay for that. I said to them to use common sense and i shouldn't have to pay for that. On the top of that, terrible behavior as they litteraly didn't care about me and were suggesting i was maybe sick before entering the flight. It was clear than the staff completely ignore my request and were even mean to me."
Scoot,Forced to buy checked baggage when I had already paid for it,3,"Recently I went to board my flight booked through kiwi.com on scoot airlines from Athens>Singapore>Sydney which I had paid for checked baggage on, but ended up having to pay for baggage again as it did not show up on the Scoot ‘system’. The scoot manager alleged that kiwi had not included checked baggage in my booking (even when provided booking confirmation evidence and an invoice). Apparently Scoot had not received payment from kiwi as a 3rd party agent for my checked baggage, therefore I was made to pay €136 euro for checked baggage. I paid for a service which I didn’t receive and was instead made to pay a large sum of money and experience significant distress. I emailed both scoot and kiwi.com multiple times and showed 3 forms of irrefutable evidence but each company blamed each other and now I’m left out of pocket. This is simply awful customer service and needs to be addressed."
Scoot,Discrimination at its finest,1,"Discrimination at its finest. If you have tattoos expect to be treated like a criminal and have bad treatment.

I went to the toilet after another passenger and when I came out was falsely accused of stealing her phone.

I was then woken by a scoot staff member (male) singapore to gold coast flight 9pm Tr6 on 6 December 2022.

And was woken up after a nice sleep and was then ordered to show my boarding pass. I woke up and had to get it from baggage like a slave and then shown and then asked if I wanted to be updated on the ladies missing phone. I then replied no I don't care.

After sitting here for hours angry I finally approached a staff member and complained.

I'm so disgusted in this airline , and Discrimination. I'm seriously contemplating sering a lawyer and pursuing damages after this flight.

I'm so angry!!!! I'm never flying this airline again and hopefully can spread the word and warn others about this vile behaviour."
Scoot,Avoid,1,Out flight was rescheduled then delayed causing us to miss our connection to Zurich and on to Manchester. Customer service was appalling - pretty much told us we were on our own and to sort it out ourselves. The delay caused us to be stranded in Singapore for three days. We would never fly with Scoot again.
Scoot,I flew from Singapore to Bali and scoot…,1,I flew from Singapore to Bali and scoot left my luggage in Singapore which meant I had no clothes for a whole 24 hours. They ruined my birthday as I had to sit in the hotel the whole day whilst I wait for them to fly my luggage in. I made a claim the same day for my luggage for the inconvenience which was on the 23/01/23…. We are now on the 30/04/23 and despite numerous emails to their claims department I am still waiting to hear back. First and last time I use this diabolical airline.
Scoot,Always a reluctant choice,1,"Scoot communication is exceptionally poor, other than for the number of times the well intentioned front line staff (if to be found) will apologise on behalf of the company. That on check-in updated flight information is not provided, that there is no information broadcast to ticketed passengers, is shameful.

Each time I have flown Scoot (no easy viable alternative which may explain the complacency and somewhat patronising approach it takes to issues) I am surprised by how lean it is, and unable to easily manage exceptions. Not that delays are exceptions.

And do expect the usual platitudes when calling Scoot out, whether in person or otherwise.

Edit: when trying to find out new etd (TR674 18 June) while in the airport, Scoot customer help line (which takes too long to answer) stated a new etd 30 mins later than the revised time per airport boards.... surprised to know actual departure was later than both revised times. How to treat customers like sheep and get away with it!"
Scoot,Booked and paid for extra legroom,1,"Booked and paid for extra legroom. O boarding realised was standard seat. Impossible to get money refunded after 6 months and 20 emails.... They literally don't reply so what can you do?

AVOID 100%"
Scoot,Scoot - do NOT fly with this airline!,1,"After just coming off a terrible 13 hour Scoot flight I’d like to caution anyone choosing this company.
They call themselves a low cost long haul airline but this model really doesn’t work because the starting cost isn’t actually that low and when you factor in all your other costs you’ll likely end up paying more.
There no inflight entertainment, no charging points for your own devices, no water, no blankets, no food in fact no anything unless you chose to pay extra for very poor & expensive options.
We paid $50 for family ‘snacks’ and sandwiches that were disgusting. Oh and you can’t pay by debit card, or Amex. Only cash or selected credit cards.
There’s no individual air blowers (so the whole plane is set to close to freezing temperature) the seats are creaking and the planes feed like there from the 80s and falling apart.
Plus your long haul baggage allowance is one 20kg per family so you’ll have to squeeze everything for your two week holiday in to bags to haul on the the plane with you, or pay €120 a bag extra.
Low cost, budget, crappy service works ok in Europe on short haul flights but not long haul. Yes you can download your own entertainment, load up on power packs and bring your own food (if you can sneak it through undetected) but really I wouldn’t bother.
Also check carefully to see if you’re actually flying direct or have a 4 hour diversion via Athens like we had.
The lower price may look attractive but I really wouldn’t bother with such a poor flying experience.
Avoid Scoot at all costs."
Scoot,They cancel flight,1,"They cancel flight, I choose a refund, after 2 months of waiting I started chargeback. They don’t answering anything specific and just buying time and cheating. I extremely do not recommend."
Scoot,Even Airhelp discourages from flying with this airline,1,"Truly my worst experience. Boarded a flight, waited inside for full 3 hours while they were trying to turn on one of the engines. Very unsettling as the pilot kept informing us of the failed attempts and kept saying that they will try one more time and be on the way. After 3 hours of trying they finally canceled the flight. No one rebooked us. We were given a piece of paper to file a claim for a refund and let us to figure out everything on our own. No food or hotel vouchers, nothing. We were let to book last minute expensive flights on our dime and all the other expenses. The piece of paper that was given to us specifically said that they will not cover any third party expenses (like hotel or food). There was no Scoot counter or ground personell. I called customer service, who literally told me “but miss, as per our system you’ve already boarded the flight. If you wish to voluntarily disembark, please speak to the flight attendants” I about fell off my chair. Due to the fact that in their system it was a boarded flight, she was unable to rebook me either. Told me to submit the claim for a refund as requested. She was also quite unpleasant so that was an additional treat. I even contacted AiHelp and was informed that as per their experience, passengers do not receive refunds or compensation even they they are entitled to it.” Wild. I will most definitely look into filing a proper case. Unbelievable."
Scoot,Atrocious,1,"Atrocious. Website unusable. App even worse. Simply cannot contact for support on any basis.

Business regulators should put this lot out of operation. A complete fraud of a company."
Scoot,Simply the worse traveling experience…,1,"Simply the worse traveling experience ever. 20 years traveling all over the world and never has that happened to me before with no airline.

They basically modified an already confirmed itinerary, 6 weeks later the initial confirmation and few weeks before our travel logistics started, which involved connections.

Once they changed the itinerary with new hours, we basically had to give up on our original itinerary and its multiple connections.

I did contact the customer service both by chat and by phone and they simply ignored me… they did not propose any alternative or support whatsoever!

Cherry on top, once we landed in Singapore where the HQ is, there was a massive issue with overbookings and people were left out of the plane….

A real shame. Stay away from this airline at all costs, trust me"
Scoot,Most terrible airline I have ever flown…,1,"Most terrible airline I have ever flown with, and I've been around the world.
Their customer service is the most incompetent bots on earth. They dont have the mental capacity to put two and two together. The staff at the airport wanted to charge me 4 times the price of my ticket (over $1,000) ... all because I wanted to add a little carry-on.
They completely broke my other suitcase, so I had to go buy a new one. This was AFTER losing my suitcases for over 24 hours!

Honestly, it's a waste of money. Pay a couple extra dollars and fly with an airline that is more professional with staff who are able to think on their own.

I'm STILL waiting for a reply about my luggage, and it's been 3 weeks!"

Scoot,Terrible airline,1,"Terrible airline. They charges me 2x my ticket price for slightly overweight bags. When I got on the plane we were informed that we were not able to buy anything unless we had cash (in their currency). They don’t provide snacks, soda, liquor or even water!! That’s crazy. They wouldn’t accept my card either.

There were other passengers on the plane that were very loud and constantly moving around as well as handing food over our seats and they wouldn’t ask them to sit down and shut up. 0/10 Trash Airline - DO NOT BOOK!!!!"
Scoot,Terrible company that does not care about its passengers,1,"Scoot did the following for a trip of mine:
-delayed flights and only let me know at check in
-knowing they had delayed a flight, did NOT employ enough people at the check in line so I waited over 2 hours to check in. Was told by an employee they cut staff numbers from 8 to 6, to the protest of the staff members
-Told me I could make my connecting flight
-Changed the arrival time of my first flight right before I boarded my first flight
-When I landed, told me I would miss my connecting flight
-Gave me a 12$ voucher that I could barely redeem anywhere while I wait for my connecting flight
-Refused to give me access to a lounge to freshen up- was told by customer support they NEVER give lounge access for any delays
-When I wrote them an official complaint, they responded saying they would get back to me, however after following up, they are not responding

Shame on you Scoot, I will be pursuing this further legally. I have all the time in the world. In the mean time, if you can, avoid flying with them."
Scoot,ABSTOLUTELY ATROCIOUS!,1,"ABSTOLUTELY ATROCIOUS!! SCAM AIRLINE!! The way to Athens was bad enough - Smelly, uncomfortable, with everything being a paid addon/not available in economy. But the real pain came on the way back. The flight was scheduled for 4:10pm. But the plane had just taken off 3 hours earlier. No message, no email, no call. It just took off on a new schedule without notification. Airport said it happens everyday with Scoot. It might be a scam, but who knows? Perhaps the worst thing about the airline is the customer service. They are arrogant, rude, annoying, and liars. They hang up/end conversation, no matter how much you try, no matter what platform or number of customer service you use. They did not admit their mistake for so long, and when they finally did, they end the call to escape a refund. They give excuses to slack off like pretending they can't hear you on the phone. You can't even get through to their number half the time. And they don't care about you and your problems, and are awfully unhelpful."
Scoot,Don’t use them.,1,"Booked flight with 20kg allowance and at the check in counter was told to pay again. It was equivalent of 39eu for 1hr flight in Asia. Didn’t matter that I had confirmation email with luggage allowance and everything.

I flew from Manila to Athens last year and I can say it was the worst flight I have ever had . A member of the flight crew actually put his hands on my body over a cup of water I have never experienced anything like this in my life . I made a complaint on line 120 days ago and I just get the same reply the same BS and it’s makeing me more angry

After you add up the cost of the flight extra payment for suit case. Pay for ur seat. Pay a cup of coffee you can fly with a much better airline quatar BA emirates
I leave Singapore air out of my list as they are the owners of scoot lol

Shame on Singapore air lines for supporting and promoting such a BA airline"
Scoot,"Rudeness, unprofessionalism and ignorance",1,"At the beginning of an 8 hour flight a steward spilled a brewing hot coffee over me and no action, apology or help has been provided. The rudeness, unprofessionalism and ignorance of this airline goes above and beyond and I can highly recommend to avoid them."
Scoot,The chatbot is terrible,1,"The chatbot is terrible. The option to speak to a real person is next to impossible. After waiting 15 minutes, when it came my turn it said my time had expired. This happened twice. This needs massive improvement. Scoot you need to allocate a few people to deal with queries."
Scoot,It's the worst airline ever,1,It's the worst airline ever. Their customer service is the worst. We missed our flight due to the immigration delay and they don't want to rebook us. There was 8 of us and we spent a lot of money. No help at all from customer service. They stole our money.
Scoot,Completely inflexible - scam,1,"I booked my flight without realising that the visa office would be closed for a week for ramadan so in order to avoid extoritionate visa overstay fees I wanted to change my flight. They are the most inflexible airline I have ever flown with - £71 flight change fee which is absolutely extortionate and no flexibility to change destination and no possibility to cancel at all. Customer service is completely useless. Even if it costs me more in the future I will never fly with them ever again knowing this is how they treat customers, basically a scam airline"
Scoot,deception...,1,"deception...

Scoot,Stay away,1,"ad a horrendous experience with Scoot.
I booked a 17.50 flight with them, but had technical issues when booking. It didn't go through properly. So I reached out and tried again. This time it worked, however when the itinerary came through, it was the wrong flight.
I don't understand how it managed, I assume the other flight was full and they just put me on the next best thing. However, I wasn't even in the city at the time of the flight it booked me in for.
I reached out to customer service but they refused to take responsibility and said I must have booked the earlier flight. Why would I do that?! There was literally no way of me making that flight. I triple checked before booking and it had been the right flight. They didn't trust that, and refused to believe their system could make such a mistake. Customer service was awful, they just repeated the same thing over and over. Likely to be a bot. I have tried to get a transcript of my communications to them regarding the technical issues, as I am discussing what flight I am booking, but they are refusing to give me that as it is a data issue. So they are super dodgy, I would just avoid them at all costs, they've essentially just taken £400 off of me"
Scoot,Changing flight,1,"change fee is SGD120 + pay the actual price ticket, the amount that paid will not be deducted.
It is cheaper to buy a new flight than changing it. Doesn't make sense at all."
Scoot,I have been trying to change a flight…,1,"I have been trying to change a flight for several weeks now and it has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I cannot make the change on their website in Manage my flight because it show all flights I want to change to as not applicable even though there are plenty of seats if I were to book a new flight. I purchased a flex fare which should allow me to make the change if there are less expensive seats available than what I originally paid for.
I tried calling the call center three times yesterday and after finally reaching an agent each time in all three calls I was disconnected as soon as the agent was about to make the change for me.
I tried using their chat and after finally reaching a live agent the chat session disconnected me even though I kept responding within the 1 minute limit.
I feel Scoot is doing everything possible to make it impossible for a customer to change a flight which I have paid for the option to do so. So now I will have to purchase a new flight (On a different airline!) and lose all the value of the old ticket."
Scoot,Unreliable airline,2,"I have used this airline three times. My experiences were not too bad overall, but it's unlikely I'll fly with them again - their prices are not so low at all for a budget airline, and they aren't very reliable.

1) My first experience with Scoot was several years ago, shortly after the airline was launched. Return flights between Hong Kong and Melbourne. The flights were pretty cheap since it was the early days. No delay or cancellation, normal service.

2) Second flight was a one-way flight from HK to Melbourne in January 2023. I had to purchase baggage, and the price ended up being pretty high -- not much lower than a one-way flight offered by a regular airline. No delay or cancellation, normal service.

3) My third experiences were in early 2024. I booked two trips: Sydney-HK, HK-Kuala Lumpur. Both return trips within the span of several months. I booked months ahead, but the flights kept being rescheduled -- e.g. the HK-Kuala Lumpur flight was rescheduled to the morning of the following day, which wouldn't work for my travel plans at all.

I ended up cancelling both trips and had to purchase another set of tickets for HK-Australia from Singapore Airlines 1.5 months before departure. The cheaper fare classes were sold out, so I had to pay an extra AUD300 for a flexible ticket.

Scoot did offer full refunds for my flights since they were rescheduled due to ""operational reasons"". I received the refunds the day after I submitted my cancellation requests. Still, I would not fly with them again -- I don't want to risk having to book flights with another airline and pay expensive fares thanks to Scoot's unreliability."
Scoot,Paid for extra leg room - got regular seats,1,"Paid for extra leg room seats and got regular seats. Wanted to chat with human, but bot is telling me my booking reference number is wrong (I’ve checked twice).
Guys, what’s wrong with you???"
Scoot,Horrible service!!,1,"Horrible service!

Customer service cannot help with whatever problems you have. And the problems are from their websites.

I would never buy tickets with Scoot again."
Scoot,Bad Service Airline,2,"Fly with Scoot TR277 today 15/09/2022 from Jakarta to Singapore. We bought the ticket a month ago for A$200 one way.

Flight scheduled to depart at 11.50AM. We didn't board until around12.30pm. As i am writing this at 12.55pm, the plane is still on the tarmac, awaiting take off. No clue how much longer we need to wait..

No announcement made what so ever what cause the delay, let alone asking apology.

Terrible airline. Will not fly with Scoot again."
Scoot,taff unhelpful if you run into any…,1,"taff unhelpful if you run into any issues on the way over

Our taxi driver had a flat tire, pulled over to change and and we were late

Rushed over to the airport and was 2 min late for check in

The staff mocked me and told me I was rushing and sweating and told me they wouldn’t do anything

Never flying this garbage again"
Scoot,"Don't think of how much you can save, think of how much you can afford to lose",1,"Terrible experience with their customer service (or rather, lack thereof) when they lost my luggage. By their admission they know exactly where it is (they left it behind in Singapore where I was transitting) - first 7 days when I could actually reach a real person they provided automated responses with no accountability as to when I could get an update re: when my luggage would be sent back. After 7 days they just ignored my messages after telling me to lodge a claim with Charles Taylor Aviation - where, based on other people's feedback, you will likely never get a resolution to your compensation claim."
Scoot,Flight delayed by approx. 15 hours and luggage delayed by 2 days,1,"My flight from Melbourne to Cebu was delayed by 15 hours last January 2023. So, I missed by mother’s surprised birthday celebration (the reason why I flew home). My luggage was also delayed by 2 days so my Australian frozen steak (supposed to be my pasalubong to my family) were all damaged by the time my luggage arrived. I tried to claim for damages, but Scoot’s customer service just passed me to their insurer, Charles Taylor. Scoot’s customer service wasn’t helpful, it felt like you were talking to robots from the other side.

After I submitted my claim to their insurer, it took weeks before they responded. And every time they respond, they would keep asking the same set of documents which I already submitted. Again, it felt like you were talking to robots.

So approximately 4 months now and I haven’t received anything from them. That’s how bad their services are – both from Scoot and Charles Taylor (their insurer).
I know they are bit cheaper but if you can, AVOID this airline. Sometimes it is better to pay for a full-service flight which is a little bit expensive but with better service (after sales service) than budget airlines like Scoot (and to think scoot is not really that cheap compared to PAL or Qantas).

Never had that experience before so I’m just sharing it to everybody."
Scoot,SCOOT HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT CUSTOMERS!,1,"SCOOT HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT CUSTOMERS!
My mother in law is critically ill (stage 4 lung cancer) in the UK. My wife and child have been in the UK since Oct. We were supposed to travel to Melbourne for Christmas. Obviously those plans were changed and I leave in 3 days for the UK also (from Singapore). I requested a refund on compassionate grounds. Scoot never confirmed my refund request (I took a screenshot luckily as they tried to deny I had made the request). They have avoided answering me about the cancellation since the application was made in early Nov. Now they sent me an email asking for proof that I can’t travel (ie a medical certificate for me or one of the travellers). These people aren’t stupid- they are just completely UNTRAINED in CUSTOMER SERVICE. They have no regard for people, are insensitive, obfuscative, and devoid of basic human decency. I am shocked that Singapore Airlines would be associated with such a sub standard organisation. The date below is the date I received my first email from scoot (just asking for more information) after having been online with them several times for literally hours- but to no avail. My wife’s travel date has passed. Mine is this week. I bet I get charged with no show fees on top of this. Scoot are so bad at customer service that they make Ryan air appear to be a paragon of good service by comparison."
Scoot,Zero customer service,1,Zero customer service. Call center in Indonesia and Singapore does not answer. Check in does not recognize my booking reference number. Worst customer service ever. Basically there is none.
Scoot,Awful scam,1,"Awful. Paid for flexi on website and it didn't issue it even though I paid. I know for sure 100 % I went out of my way to purchase it as the check in desk on scoot forced me to buy another ticket to check me in and I knew I wouldn't use those dates.

Customer service said, prove it with a screenshot, I obviously didn't have the foresight to think their website would scam me.

I said look at the price I paid for the ticket, it's exactly to the penny what the cost of flexi is. Their suggestion is the flight price must of changed. It happens to be exactly the same price. Apparently it's just a coincidence that to the exact penny the price increase in the moment I booked it to what flexi would cost and then returned to the same price it has been for several weeks.

There seems to be nothing I can do. She said I can change my flight but I would need to pay double the cost to change my flight than to buy a new ticket?

This is the worst airline I've ever used."
Scoot,Spend extra to avoid this terrible…,1,"Spend extra to avoid this terrible experience. Dated, dirty and worst seats ever, like sitting on a plank of wood made worse by 1 hr delay."
Scoot,Terrible Service,1,"I was travelling from Singapore to India as a transit stop over (i.e. not leaving the airport - just there for three hours). Once I got to the airport in Singapore, I was asked for my visa. They said that I needed a visa for India because Scoot does not have a relationship with any other flight so I need to leave the airport and then go back in as though I actually visited the country. I have used several other flight companies in the past and this has never ever been a process for any other flight company.

I was never informed of this. The staff there provided no support. The only advice that they could give me was to buy a ticket from another company (clearly they did not trust their own flight service). I then had to pay $2500 at the last minute to get to my original destination through another means. When I called Scoot for a refund of my ticket, they refused to give me a refund for this trip. Also, their flight wasn't that cheap. I even had to pay for food on the flight. Worst airline I have ever dealt with. I do not recommend this to anyone."
Scoot,"Broke my luggage, no replies",1,"They broke my luggage during a flight and told me to contact their agent (Charles Taylor Aviation) at this email (scootclaimsATctplc.com). I wrote twice and each time I got auto-replies saying they will reach out soon. After more than 3 weeks, still no replies. I tried to contact them via the chat on their site, they said they would have reached out soon, still no replies. Don't trust this company"
Scoot,Do not fly Scoot - disgraceful.,1,"Writing under another name due to the worry that they will penalise my current complaint with them. FlyScoot lost my son's bags from Athens to Bali. The lost and found was closed, so he couldn't file a PIR. He also had to rush as the Scoot plane was late to get connector flights to Australia with another airline. Once in Australia, he asked the Scoot desk for a PIR - their response: 'We don't have those'. For over a week I have been passed from pillar to post via 'guest experience' operators and customer service, plus having been ignored totally by lost and found. My emails to them are well set out and clear, with records of previous comms in each one. Same reply everytime - give us the PIR. I can't!! You didn't give us one!! This airline is utterly appalling - as is their customer service. DO NOT FLY SCOOT. They are lacking in duty of care, and 'care' itself. I will be raising this issue and not letting it go. I am so cross that they just don't care at all. To info@scoot - when you get this - search your records for current complaints and match me up - unlike my son and his luggage.... I would award Scoot NO STARS if I could edit this review."
Scoot,Atrocious Airline,1,"Atrocious Airline. Due to being granted leave by her employer my Filipino friend had two Scoot flight tickets - one from Singapore to Thailand return and one from Singapore to Manila return. On returning from Thailand the airline refused to check her all the way to Manila, even though she had both Scoot tickets and only 1 hour connection time at Singapore. They insisted she clear immigration into Singapore, and check in before going back into departures. She planned to run and do this as she had another connection flight at Manila to her home. To help she had only hand carry. However, the Scoot flight was late in arriving so she lost her flight because of this madness. She was left in Singapore with the prospect of not enough money to buy another flight to Manila and potential loss of her connection flight to home. I had to step in an buy here a new ticket online with another airline for her to make the connection. I honestly cannot understand this rule as all other airlines I know will check one all the way through as long as both tickets were with them. I think they will lose customers as result of this atrocious ruling. It also burdens immigration and security with additional passengers unnecessarily."
Scoot,Fair choice for budget airlines,4,"Flown with Scoot a few times. They are for sure an efficient and low cost airline. I would definitely fly with them again. However, they put a huge crack in one of my suitcases and I've been waiting 6 weeks to hear back from them about it."
Scoot,Very lousy and buggy booking system,2,"Very lousy and buggy booking system. My sister tried to book flight this week, but without success as the page never loaded.

Update: We used the app and it went through. But the website still needs to be fixed."
Scoot,Seat 30e and 30d.,1,"Seat 30e and 30d.
Last line of the plane.
Really uncomfortable.
The leg’s space it’s around 6 cm less theme the others seats lines.
Plus the backrest is hard as a wood table.
It’s not possible to flet the seat.
It’s probably the worst seat flight I haven’t seen. Even worst then Ryanair.
Stay avoid form this terrible company."
Scoot,Horrible service,1,"I had a 12-hour flight from Singapore to Berlin. I requested ""max your space"" to buy the 2 seats next to me so I could be more comfortable during the flight, but my request got denied due to the flight being too full. During my layover I unfortunately got hurt and had to be heavily medicated and I was told I should maybe postpone my flight. As I really had to be in Germany today I could not postpone it. When I got to the flight I realized there was an entire row free, so I explained the situation to the flight attendant and asked if I could move there, and told them I would be willing to pay for it. They asked for 100 euros (which is expensive given no one was sitting there anyway, but fine).

They moved me to the new seat and brought the ATM only to tell me they don't accept any of my cards - debit cards aren't allowed for purchases over 20 euros, VISA credit cards are not allowed ever. So you either have a Mastercard or cash or you can't pay. Please note this is an airline that brags about being contactless and letting you do everything online - this is NOT true. They have ridiculous protocols, are super unhelpful, don't let you know before you board that you need a super specific credit card otherwise you can't pay for anything.

They literally moved me back to my previous spot while I was hurt and in pain and forced me to stay there for the whole flight, with a perfectly fine empty row available right next to me."
Scoot,The worst website I have seen…,1,"This is the worst website I have seen for an airline. Does Scoot live in 20th century, what the hell is this? The website is laggy, send 3 OTPs per login ... What are guys doing ? Hire proper people to make a website ..."
Scoot,Bad Bad Bad,1,"I used this company only once to go from Greece to Bali, 4 flights in total. Unfortunately, my flights were impacted by several issues that could have been avoided with proper maintenance and attention to detail.

Firstly, the fact that the airplanes were old and poorly maintained is concerning. It's important for airlines to prioritize regular maintenance to ensure that their planes are safe and comfortable for passengers. The fact that my window shutter and seat didn't work is a clear indication that these issues were not properly addressed.

Additionally, the fact that three out of four planes were delayed and one by more than an hour is frustrating.

Finally, Scoot does not provide any onboard services without charging extra fees. While it's understandable that some airlines may charge for certain amenities, such as food and beverages, the fact that passengers are required to pay for basic necessities like chargers is disappointing.

Overall, my experience with Scoot was less than ideal. I hope that the airline takes steps to improve their maintenance and communication practices in the future to ensure a more pleasant experience for their passengers."
Scoot,Scoot CANCEL ALL FLIGHT TO LONDON BUT REFUSE TO REFUND,1,"I bought scoot flight tickest for me and my family from London to Bangkok back in April 2022 for flights in August 2022. Due to seperate arrangemnet of family members I bought departure and return ticktes seperately. Then in July 2022 I got an email from Scoot that the return fligts from Bangkok was cancelled due to operational reasons. They offered me two options for refund. One by voucher and one by credit card refund. I was in a panic and click on the voucher option. However, when I went to the scoot website, all flight was cancelled until October 2022. (it turned out that all London flight are not not available now in October 2022). I called the reservation desk of London office and said that there was a mistake. The reservation desk promised to correct this. But I then got emails that they are refunding me in vouchers. I have been in communication with Scoot ever since and they refused to change. It has been a complete * of time. The London office reservation line is no longer running and there is no London flights. We cannot use the vouchers as our family will not be travelling to Thailand or the Southeast asia any time in the next few years. I am in a dead end. I really regret that we bought the Scoot ticket. The tickets we bought for the flight back from Bangkok from other airlines had to be twice the normal price as we were too late."
Scoot,What a mess!,1,"What a mess! This was the 6th time I flew with Scoot on the Germany - Vietnam route and never had problems. This time however, notwithstanding a 3 hour delay on one of the flights for which we got a mere apology from the captain and nothing else ( water, updates during waiting time, etc. - we took off at 4 am), I could not catch the last leg of my trip because they could not check me in all the way to Berlin, as the check in counter was already closed by the time we landed (also due to the delay). After talking to staff on the ground and on the phone, they kept saying there was nothing they can do, and I should just book another flight. So I had to pay another 250€ on top of the initial expense, because they allowed a ticket to be booked for which it was impossible to check in all the way, apparently. It still baffles me how this could happen. To add insult to injury, apparently I was checked in (but not given a ticket to prove it) and had to hear my name being called out for the flight without being able to pass security at the airport. So the flight was delayed because of me and a few other passengers which must have been in the same situation! We, unable to get on the flight and the flight waiting for us to get on. Now I am waiting for a refund ( which will not be anywhere close to covering my extra expense), which, from the comments I read here, I might not ever get. As other people have said here, better book a more expensive flight with a more reputable airline - if anything goes bad, the price you'll pay will be steep."
Scoot,This has to be just about the worst of…,1,"This has to be just about the worst of them. I made a booking from Narita to Berlin, paid for it and got a confirmation message and all. A few days later, I decide to check my booking and, low and behold, my booking is in a pending state and they’re now asking me to pay more money, about double the original amount. This is despite the fact that the price of the ticket on my specific travel date has not changed.

At this point, I’m basically fuming and so I decide to contact a customer care agent. The first agent I reach is rude and obnoxious, even though I’m calm and my tone has been down. They end up disconnecting the call.

I decide to contact them again and this time an agent tells me that I have to pay the money. I explain to them why it doesn’t make sense for me to pay double for a ticket that’s still the same price as before and they’re like, “sorry no refunds, I can’t help you”.

After the call, they email to basically tell me, in no uncertain times, to go fcuk myself. Never been treated so harshly before. I understand you may have a tight budget but stay away from Scoot or you’ll end up spending more than a more reputable airline that looks more pricy on paper.

tldr; Budget airlines, of which scoot is a member, are crap and not worth the hustle."
Scoot,"Competitive rates, ok in Scoot Plus, must read fine print",3,"Competitive rates, flew Berlin-Phuket (roundtrip) via Singapore in Scoot Plus. All four flights were on time. However, please be aware that Scoot Plus isn't a full business class. You have one meal, one beverage and one tiny welcome water included (yes, even on a 13h flight in Scoot Plus) and that's it. If you need more, be prepared to pay. We did get additional cups of water for the return flight but this doesn't seem to be consistent. There's no in-flight entertainment, seats aren't lie-flat (but still comfy, wide, with a leg rest and good recline). There are no free blankets, pillows and eye masks, no amenity kit, no business lounge access, no flight live map. The food is poor quality junk food. My rate was about a third of what Singapore Airlines would charge for their ""real"" business class so this is an airline for the thrifty traveler. If you're prepared and make your own arrangements to keep yourself comfy on your flight, it's all good. It's very important to read the fine print. I would NOT use this airline in Economy for long-haul flights.

What I didn't like: One of my shorter flights didn't have a business class when I booked the ticket. The aircraft was later changed to a larger one with a business class. However, I still couldn't change my seat to Scoot Plus and the airline did not assign me a Scoot Plus seat. When I spoke to the cabin crew when boarding the flight, they acknowledged the problem but couldn't do anything for me even though there were still available Scoot Plus seats."
Scoot,Lost luggage e not refund money,1,"I traveled on vacation with my family, and we paid for two checked bags. When we left Bali for Thailand, we stopped in Singapore and then headed to Phuket.
Along with the suitcases, we also dispatch a stroller. The stroller arrived in Phuket, but our bags did not.
At the Phuket airport they told us to go to the hotel and they would locate our bags and take them to us. However, the next day they called and said that we would have to go to the airport to pick up our bags or a taxi driver would take them, but we would have to pay US$ 35.00.
The company at no time took the blame and did not even refund the amounts paid for the delivery of the bags. Total disrespect to the customer. It was my first time traveling on Scoot, and it was definitely my last."
Scoot,Terrible Service,1,"I asked for a refund for a ticket I booked wrong and booked a new one (timeframe 30 minutes), scoot was so kind to offer me the refund (but only as a voucher!). At the airport I realised that they didn’t refund the wrong flight, but the one I wanted to take, so no check in for me. I had to book a way more expensive ticket at the airport which also only took my to my transit (Singapore) not my destination (Jakarta). Could I use the voucher? No, because Scoot never sent it to me. After 2 h (!) on the phone with customer service they finally managed to sent me my voucher but weren’t able to help me with my struggle that I had to book a third ticket for the flight. (Flight was over an hour delayed btw) In Singapore I wanted to use the voucher to get at least my flight to Jakarta. Wasn’t possible, cause the voucher is only valid online and I couldn’t book the flight online anymore. Also the flight 8 h later was not available online. The crew at the counter at the airport was very rude an unhelpful. So I ended up booking a flight with batik air (only a fracture of scoots price by the way and very friendly staff at the airport. Result: I payed 3 tickets, couldn’t get to my end destination and still have a voucher that I probably can never use because of scoots prehistoric service policies. I can’t recommend this airline to anyone, their are way cheaper airlines in SE Asia with better service as well."
Scoot,"TL;DR: Booked special seats for extra legroom on Scoot Airlines, got different seats with no legroom, endured subpar food,",1,"I recently booked special seats for a flight from Berlin to Denpasar through Booking.com with the expectation of extra legroom, as I'm nearly two meters tall. However, upon boarding, we discovered that our seats were different from what we had booked, with no extra legroom as promised. Our frustration grew when we expressed this to the stewards, only to be embarrassed by the main steward's claim that my credit card couldn't be charged, resulting in the lack of extra legroom. He embarrassed my wife and me in front of the whole plane with lies. He lied about my credit card because I paid for extra leg space. What we got was an ordinary seat, and I told the steward, ""Why would I pay extra for ordinary seats?""

Additionally, the food we had pre-booked was subpar, akin to what one might imagine prison food to be like. The Wi-Fi doesn't work properly, which is very weird since you pay $30 USD for it.

On our return flight, we faced similar seat issues, but after voicing our complaints alongside other passengers, we finally received the extra legroom and the seats we initially booked. But it was purely because other passengers had the same problem as us. Otherwise, I am 100% sure they wouldn't have helped us again.

Despite reaching out to Scoot via email weeks prior to our return flight, we have yet to receive a satisfactory response or solution. This lack of apology or resolution has left us deeply disappointed with Scoot Airlines' customer service and overall experience.

TL;DR: Booked special seats for extra legroom on Scoot Airlines, got different seats with no legroom, endured subpar food, and faced seat issues on the return flight. Also the steward embarassed my wife and me with LIES. Poor customer service and unresolved complaints marred the experience."

Took me 4 flights to get to my destination with 2 long layover to and fro(7.hrs and 17hrs), just to go to Malaysia from Perth WA.
Each of the flight I took had female cabin crew with an attitude of rudeness and arrogance.
This is and will be my first and last time flying with Scoot, not that of our comments and reviews will be looked into by Singapore Airlines (owner of Scoot) to rectify, re train and for goodness sakes, teach them professionalism in a friendly and courteous manner towards all fee paying passengers. Everyone deserves respect from your cabin crew regardless how CHEAP your fares may be, which, in reality is a complete RIP OFF! Your women cabin crew are disgustingly unhelpful to passengers who do not know how to complete entry forms as they head towards their destination. Why do I say this? It is because I witnessed a passenger ,desperately hoping your cabin crew would assist her, however, the passenger was brushed off by your FEMALE CABIN CREW! I then offered help to the said lady. Question I'd like to ask, is this what SCOOT Cabin Crew are trained to do? BE RUDE AND ARROGANT? OR IS IT SCOOT CABIN CREW look down on passengers because your are a Budget Airline, a branch the reputable Singapore Airlines? I have given you a 1 star because I don't have an option of giving a Minus 5 Stars. Definitely will not be travelling with SCOOT Airlines anymore as it's worth nothing to me. I have no respect for your airlines now after how I have seen how your cabin treat passengers.

Scoot,Scoot do not even deserve 1 star,1,"Scoot do not even deserve 1 star.
My daughter is as I write stuck in Singapore. This was her first solo trip and is flying to Thailand from Perth with a stopover in Singapore. First of all the flight was delayed then we managed to get her onto a flight with Singapore Airlines so that she can make her connecting flight to Phuket. She arrived in plenty of time and joined the queue to board the next flight onwards. She was for no reason pulled out of the queue and asked to move to the 12.15pm flight.

I believe they saw her as an inexperienced traveller and took full advantage of her meekness so she now has to wait 5 hours for the next flight to Phuket. I called the airline at 7.40am to find out why she couldn't board and was told by a Scoot representative that the 7.50am flight had run into tech difficulties and that no one was flying. What a lie. I called back later when I double checked and saw that the flight had departed and was told by someone else ""I don't know why my colleague told you that and I'm sorry. I will try and find out why your daughter couldn't board the original flight"". I asked how long that will take - 7-14 days! What an absolute joke - I can't believe that they lied to me. There is a lack of care for their customers, zero accountability or desire to resolve this matter in any meaningful timeframe.

Why there is this marked difference between the parent airline and subsidiary fails me. Avoid as someone has mentioned, it's too high risk.

Let's hope the onward flight goes proceeds without issue."
Scoot,"Low-cost service, regular airline price",1,"One-way flight from Bali to Singapore, Sunday 2:30pm. At 10am, it is announced that the flight is delayed by 3 hours. I am missing my connection in Singapore.
Tried to change my flight online but I had booked with Expedia. Scoot told me to check with Expedia. Expedia told me to check with them. Amazing

Tried to get a refund in Bali airport, they don’t have any representative there so told me to go through their hotline, from abroad, and with about an hour to make the change. Unacceptable.

Managed somewhat to change my second leg as it became less expensive than to suck the cost from my Scoot flight.
The flight was another hour late…

And on board the showcontinues. Not a single time did they apologise for the delay. They ask things no other airline does, such as removing earbuds during take off and landing, and forcing to put my tightly tied tiny crossbody bag on their dirty floor. I fly every other week, no one else asks for these things. And the attitude, forget about it, entitled personnel for some of them.

Tried to make a complaint through their regular channel. Chat bot just asks for all my details, then concludes with
*M.A.R.V.I.E. (Bot)*
All our agents are busy right now. Please try again later.
And send me back to the initial menu.
Tried a few times, never went through. Hence this review.

Use at your own risk, it’s a really poorly managed company"

2.Upon boarding, found out they changed the plane (from an A320 to a B787) and the selected seat is no longer at the exit row.
3.When I wrote to Scoot, was only offered a S$13 refund, and I am still charged S$10 for a seat I did not select.

Does not look like Scoot bothers about its rating but thought I should add to the bad reviews."
Scoot,Highly recommend another company for long haul,2,"Quick view:
Pros:
- Crew were friendly and professional
- Leg room average for cheap airlines

Cons:
- No food or drink provided, unless paid for separately to ticket price
- Debit cards not accepted on some flights
- Extra cost to charge any electronics
- No TV’s provided on any plane, even long haul !!

Details:
I just recently went on a trip from Tokyo (Japan) - Athens (Greece). The total trip time was 33 hours, with a stopover in Singapore for 15 hours. Total cost around £800 for two people.

Scoot airlines do not provide any food/drink services within the ticket price (must be bought separately on the plane) and no tvs provided on any of the planes. Despite our trips being 6hr30 and 11hr10, we were not provided food or drinks on either flight. In fact, my card was not accepted during the second flight (despite it being accepted on the first flight) as it was a debit, not a credit card.. Me and my father went the entire 11hr10 flight, which turned into a 13hr flight due to delays, without any food or drink - no water was offered either.

Legroom was decent, the same as any other cheap airline.

You cannot charge any of your electronics without paying extra. The extra cost starts from 5 SD and up. It is free of charge for people with scoot plus.

I wish I had checked out reviews for this airline before booking with them. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend going with a different airline and paying the extra for any long haul flight."
Scoot,Seats to close together,2,"Clean plane but basic seats on Airbus a321neo. If you are more than 1.80m heigh DO NOT fly with this airline, there are no room for your legs!"
Scoot,"DID NOT EVEN FLY MYSELF, BUT I WOULD GIVE A NEGATIVE RATING IF POSSIBLE!!!",1,"My parents flew from Kuala Lumpur to Jeju, with a transit in Singapore on Scoot in April 2023.

Scoot lost the luggage, and a report was filed on arrival at Jeju. The Jeju airport was in contact with Scoot and located the luggage in Singapore. 10days in Jeju but there were no updates about the luggage.

We contacted Scoot and they mentioned that they are not responsible for it and we should contact the airport where we filed our report. We were communicating back and forth with all airports and Scoot and no updates regarding our luggage were given. We didn't know the whereabouts of our luggage and did not know if it has been reported lost or the search is still ongoing.

We filed our claims and have been following up every week but there were NO RESPONSE. Their appointed loss adjustors (Charles Taylor Aviation) would get back and ask for documents for the claim, which we provided. Then, they go missing with no updates or response, and i would have to followup every time. They repeatedly done this 3 times, and they have been asking me to provide the SAME DOCUMENTS EVERY SINGLE TIME for the same file reference.

Its already the end of August 2023 now! And the response I got was that they are unable to consider our claim based on their policy for perishable, delicate,items valued above $150 etc... Fine! Because what can you expect from Scoot anyways?!

Our whole claim has been disregarded just based on 2 Articles on their baggage policy. BUT I believe we at least deserve the claim for the cost of emergency purchase as a result of Scoot losing our luggage. This is just really unfair and irresponsible.

WORST AIRLINE EVER! I've never flew Scoot but because I am assisting my parents with the claim and it is a hassle. Please just avoid, because you will have to pay extra for a checked baggage, and they will lose your luggage, and you will have to go through the whole hassle of communicating with them.

At least Charles Taylor Aviation replied. Scoot Customer Service didn't even reply."
Scoot,You will be charged/scamed by them and never get your money back,1,"I am the last person to complain about cheap airlines. You get what you’re paying for, so I am not really expecting great perks, comfort, or customer service as long as they get me safely to my destination. That’s the deal. However, I won’t stand dishonest and cheating businesses and Scoot is a great example of that.
On my last trip with them, I was told upon checking in, that I had 11 euro credit on my account and the lady at the counter was not able to give me my ticket till I pay. She did not tell me what this payment was for (I asked, but she apparently didn’t know) and redirected me to the cashier (who was supposed to give me all the details). There, again, I was told that he didn’t know any details of the payment (“sort this out directly with the airline”), just that I need to pay. So 2 hours before my 23 hours flight to Australia I was running back and forth between two Scoot desks to find out what was this about with no luck, no one gave me any info. I was naïve enough to think that this was probably just a system issue – I gave up and paid, I thought I would resolve the issue with customer service afterward.
Wow, how stupid I was. I sent the refund request via Scoot website explaining the situation. I got the reply that the charge was for the seat selection, which I apparently requested and on which I was apparently informed. So, now I am on my 5th complaint email, saying that I have never requested a seat and they are saying that I indeed had, cause obviously they know better. I ended up paying for the service I have never received, was put under quite a stress at the airport and they do not even have the decency to take responsibility for their own mistakes.
I am lucky enough to be only 11 euro out of pocket, but watch out, cause you can easily be scammed for more. All the ordeal was extremely disgusting. I used them a few times before and never complained, but after this – never again."
Scoot,Abominable service & pathetic app,1,"The 3-strong service crew led by Iryan on Scoot flight TR431 from Kuching to Singapore on 20 April exhibited an appallingly dismal standard of customer service. I had injured my leg and was walking with a cane but had been allocated a seat in the 2nd last row. (Scoot’s app is also very poor as confirmed by the senior crewmember, Iryan, when I mentioned it.) The app very annoyingly would not allow me to add a seat selection when checking in. Having thrice asked 2 members of the crew if I could be moved closer the front, I was assured by both that they would check & revert. When this failed to happen, I asked for the 4th time and was promptly told by Iryan that there were no available seats except for upgradable ones. When I informed him that I would be happy to pay for one of these, he said he would need to check (about what I do not know) and revert. Naturally, this failed to happen yet again. I then asked one of his colleagues to call him over. When he finally deigned to appear, I informed him that by failing to deliver what they promised every single time, they were adding insult to injury - which invariably results in poor customer experience. Iryan was surprisingly blasé and didn’t seem to be at all bothered by this; almost as if receiving such complaints was a regular occurrence to be ignored. Intriguingly, as he mentioned that he had no idea what customer service training SIA crew received, I detected an ill-concealed smirk. Considering that Scoot is part of SIA (of which I have been a Gold Krisflyer member for well over 2 decades), this is most disappointing. I would’ve thought that they would select and train their frontline service staff - even for the low end Scoot - to reflect SIA’s lofty standards to ensure positive customer experience. (In a world where consumers always have options, customer service is often what differentiates!) This is evidently not the case. Needless to say, I will be avoiding this airline like the plague in future. PS: (1) I never did hear from Iryan if there was an upgradable seat available (I highly suspect that there was).. (2) iryan jovially pointed out that SIA’s Krisflyer gold membership was worth nothing when flying Scoot."
Scoot,Website broken and waste of time everytime,1,"I have to contact an agent on their livechat everytime that my company book me a flight with them, I want to change my seat and pay for a better one, the payment page is always in error, they sent a payment link via email i can't have access the booking reference is not recognized, this company is a shame, everytime it's a nightmare,I know why I never book low cost for my personal travel, with SG airlines it takes me 5min to change a seat, Scoot it's 2 hours if it works, sometimes I end up with no seat change and very angry, Not sure if SG airlines is proud of its little sister, they need to fix their website.... however their agents and stewards onboard are very nice nothing to say about them"
Scoot,BEWARE: very unreliable airline and if things go wrong you're trapped,1,"We had an onwards flight from Gold Coast to Ho Chi Minh City (via Singapore) and a return flight from Hanoi to Gold Coast (via Singapore).

1) Our onwards flight Singapore to Ho Chi Minh was changed for no apparent reason and instead of a 2-hour stopover we had to stay overnight in Singapore (meaning extra cost and one day less in Vietnam). Our return flight scheduled 2 weeks later was also cancelled/changed for no apparent reason. Instead of arriving very early on Monday (just in time for work) we had to take a Scoot flight that arrived 2 days earlier (otherwise the next flight involved arriving Wednesday morning, 2 days late for work). So, to start with, we lost almost 3 days of holidays in Vietnam because Scoot cancelled/changed our flights.
Advice number 1: if you plan your holidays with scoot, chances are they'll make a mess of it. I've read in other reviews that these changes and cancellations tend to happen so: SCOOT = HIGHLY UNRELIABLE.

2) The return flight was delayed around 8 hours (we had no explanation from the company as why that happened) and we lost our connecting flight from Singapore to Gold Coast. Scoot offered 2 options. a) Take the next Scoot flight to Gold Coast and arrive on Wednesday morning. b) Take the next Scoot flight to Sydney or Melbourne (arriving the next day), buy a ticket from another airline to get to Gold Coast (which we would have to pay for, of course) and then try to claim the cost of the ticket through Scoot's customer care.
As we couldn't afford to arrive on Wednesday and lose two days of work, we had to go with option b.
Now we're trying to request a refund/compensation for the extra flights we had to pay and I can say that it's been my worst experience ever so far with any airline (including other low cost airlines).
I've written twice to customer care, spent a long time on their chat, and their replies are consistently appalling. It's dishonest and disrespectful. They acknowledge nothing at all and reply like bots. It's like hitting a wall carefully designed to avoid any minimum amount of accountability.
I’ll now need to go through a flight claims company to see if they can pass through this wall.

So, be aware that it's a very high-risk airline in terms of things going wrong (delays, changes and cancellations) and then letting you deal with the consequences."

Scoot,"Scoot-(flyscoot) whatever you do, Do Not use this airline.",1,"I booked a flight LGW-BKK on 05/22

Flight departing 18/9/22

On the 6/9/22 I emailed scoot to check the flight was still scheduled to leave on the 18th as I’d seen a few flights had been cancelled, they just ignored me.

18/9/22 (day of my flight) the Scoot app was telling me to go to the airport.
The flight had been cancelled but I had not been informed. They just left me stranded.

I had to buy another ticket at a cost of £700, had they informed me of the cancellation this would have been a lot cheaper.

I claimed my entitled compensation from Scoot, to be told they had emailed me on the 7th July and informed me of the cancellation (and no it’s not in my junk folder, I checked with my private email provider) they had not made contact with me, they are basically just lying as this gets them out of having to pay compensation.

I asked for proof of this and received something a 10 year old could have knocked up in photoshop, It did not prove anything.

They take about 8 weeks to respond to you if you’re lucky, they don’t answer the phone for hours, when the call gets tricky they just hang up.

Whatever you do, do not fly with this airline, they don’t care about you or any rights you have, they will just lie.

I even contacted to CEO of Scoot who just blocked my email address twice, he must know they are lying but is not prepared to do anything about it.

For anyone who is struggling with Scoot customer care, you can contact the CEO Leslie Thng..look at the Singapore Air management page, you will work out the email, as I'm not allowed to post it here.

This has to be the worst airline I have ever had to deal with, PLEASE AVOID AT ANY COST.
This airline is a owned by Singapore Air, I really would avoid them too, I’m all for budget airlines but I struggle to understand how they can be associated with this absolute lying shambles run by complete scumbags, which is Scoot.

How can the authorities let these awful people operate, shame on you Singapore, I thought you were a decent Asian country.

It does raise the question “How safe are these flights?”

Finally after a year I got my money back but no compensation not even an apology.

They even sent me a text asking if I had enjoyed my flight….Stay WELL away."
Scoot,Supports fraud/theft,1,"In my opinion, this company supports theft.

My discussion with Travellink.com where they managed to take money from my credit card despite giving me errors on the website (First ""Not working, try again"", then ""card declined, try another"") where they took the money after all and then transferred it to Scoot for plane tickets (see my Travellink review.) has so far ended with Travellink blaming Scoot, telling me Scoot is the company I need to contact.

I put people on working the Travellink angle and contacted Scoot.
Initially, it looked like they were doing a good job. First, they confirmed receipt of my email, then shortly followed up with a ""this will take some time, sorry"" email. Then another ""this will take some time, sorry"" email, and another.
Then they came back, asking for documents. I sent them the documents. And got another ""this will take time..."" email.
Then they asked for more documents. And another ""this will take..."" email followed.
Then they asked me to TRANSLATE the documents. I asked, ""do I need to use an official translator, or could I translate this myself?"".
My next email from them was, ""Sorry about the delay. Your request has been transferred to the highest level, but we have a lot to do"".

So... I got a bit worried. Did that mean I no longer didn't need to provide a translation? Or was this proof that there are several support people/departments in Scoot, and they do not communicate?
I sent an email asking this and was promptly told, ""we have finished your case. You need to talk to Travellink. According to X rule, we are not responsible in whatever governs responsibilities between travel agents and airlines.""

The funny bit is that Travellink cited the same rule and told me, ""Scoot is responsible"".

I feel sad. In short, Scoot said, ""we do not care you tell the money is stolen from you. The money is now in our account, and we see no reason to try to figure out what happened.""
And then closed with, ""please come to an agreement with the thief. If you can do that, we will refund the money if that is what your agreement says.""

Are you really allowed to profit from theft based on ""we only got the money, we didn't steal it from you""?"

Scoot,The s*** stain in the plane whiteys of the airline world,1,"Athens to Singapore
I hadn’t used or heard of scoop for a while so I was surprised when I went through a travel agent to see our 11hr flight from Singapore to Athens was with the airline. At every possible turn I got quick reminders as to why this is the worst airline you can get, especially with a child. We get the call that most airlines get for first boarding with children, before we could even pick all our items up they had already called up the next groups, we have to wait with a crying baby to get on. Once on the plane it’s just a constant display of a pathetic customer focused experience and glaring evidence of a cost saving pyramid. Just a few to pick from if you are thinking of travelling with them and want to make an informed decision.

- No head rest flaps to rest your head on to sleep, just a hard back
- Almost everything is charged, including water, a 12hr flight with one small bottle of complimentary water (thank you, so kind)
- No TV, which I get on a shorter flight but not a 12hr flight. It’s absurd.
- Garbage wifi and very limited
- No power points for the devices you are supposed to use in the absence of TVs.
- The next upgrade up looked like what you would basically get at any other airline as a standard economy flight
- The seats are so cramped, there should be a warning for anyone over 6ft, I jest you not.
- Used our wise card twice with two seperate hostesses for previous transactions, came to use it a third time with a different hostess, told they don’t accept it.
- No full cream milk for a baby but were erming and arring about letting the milk we had on.
- No blankets or cushions

Athens to Singapore

- 3x delays
- Original delay
- Further delay when we were there
- Then made us go down the ramp to the plane only for us to wait for 20 mins and then be asked to go back up and wait as there was a new issue
- 2x change of gates
- Asked to put our milk in the fridge as we had to bring some for our baby for the journey (no available milk) told they can’t do that because of cross contamination but did it on the flight to Athens.

Arrival into Melbourne
- lost our yoyo pram, waited for 45 mins just for the pram before other entry requirements, nothing.

I have never felt more compelled to write a review, it felt like a joke at the end. Given the brand, they should not assume anything when it comes to what customers know. There should be more education for staff to inform passengers in general of things that are different from others airline but especially those with kids.

When you have nothing else to look at but out the window in between juggling a child, the wing was a perfect metaphor for the Scoop brand. Full of rust and what looks like random botch paint jobs, it doesn’t fill you with hope that scoop care about anything but profits.
Singapore Airlines is an airline I have used many times and have been really happy with them, it is so far removed from this experience, so far.

Possible retort - What do you expect from a budget airline.
Answer - Not this. Much much much much better. Not even basic, it’s just crap. If I paid $500 for my family I’d be pissed off so you can imagine paying what we did, it’s absolutely turgid, inept, way below par and I’m pretty disgusted."
Scoot,The worst.,1,"The worst.
F*** you scoot, I'll never choose you.

Your company should go out of business. No one should use scoot"
Scoot,"When the problem happens, it's total chaos",1,"When there are no unplanned events, then it can be said that the company itself is not so bad. Scoot could get a lower passing grade. Lower, because their planes, although the date of the first flight was not so long ago, only a few years, but the interior of the plane looks worn, the wings are stuck with fix tape, which somehow caused me discomfort, the staff on all my flights so far were not as friendly as on competing ones airline company. It is not possible to bring drinking water at Changi Airport (Terminal 1) and if you need a smaller amount of water to drink your medicine, you will have to pay about €3 for that.
If a problem happens, then you will see how this company is solely profit oriented and how much it does not care about passenger satisfaction. Calling their outsourced call center is just a waste of time and energy, in fact, they don't even offer adequate information about the delayed flight or lead them to the wrong conclusion in order to make a decision that suits them even though the passenger is at a loss in such a situation.
I can freely say that they lied to me and that is why I made wrong decisions during my last flight with them that cost me several hundred euros more than it should have been. The call center claimed that they could not provide an earlier connecting flight (I had an appointment that I had to be on time for), so I asked them to cancel that connecting flight (never get money back) and booked another flight, with another company at the highest possible price because the reservation was only a few hours before departure. Later it turned out that other passengers got the termin we requested, but directly at the airport.
The ticket itself is not significantly cheaper than the serious competition that preserves reputation and has planes with far more passenger comfort equipment to be able to behave like that.
Once I was forced to demand from them, due to their mistake, a refund for the flight and even after four months I have not received the money back. Communication on this is one-way with auto-responders or simple rejections without explanation and this kind of communication with them seems like a waste of time to me. The second time they delayed the flight for 2 whole days and when I demanded compensation, they just coldly refused me without any explanation, which is not in line with EU regulations
I know from my experience that I will not fly with this company again because I prefer to pay 20% more and save my free time and nerves. In fact, with hidden costs, it is no longer 20% because their flights from Berlin, where I flew from, are in the early morning (probably in order to get cheaper treatment at the airport), but this then requires me to come a day earlier in Berlin, paying for hotel accommodation, etc."

Scoot,Travel on 17Aug'24 on an early morning…,1,"Travel on 17Aug'24 on an early morning flight to Ipoh from SG Changi Airport on flight TR488.

Requesting for special assistance for high lift service due to unavailable areo-bridge connecting at Changi Airport Terminal 1 departing gate C12, for an elderly 92 years-old wheelchair lady but was declined due to reason given there is no high lift service at World Renown Award-Winning Changi International Airport which took us by a great surprise.

Nevertheless, we proceed to check-in and have our wheelchair-bound elderly great-grand mother to walk from departing gate to a ferry bus, up and down the high-step on the bus and walked to the stairways after alighting, and the poor elderly great-grand mother with weak limbs and walking disability had to suffer climbing the stairways (at least 16~20 steps) on-board the scoot plane with our help to require lifting both her limbs onto each higher step on the stairways, panting from step to a higher step breathlessly.

Yet after seated down to rest after suffering such heavily activity while other passengers were boarding, and we hardly can imagine with our eyes to witness that another middle-aged female passenger with clutches and knee-guard was served & seated on Airport provided wheelchair, boarding the plane with the high lifting service onto same flight TR488.

With tremendous shocking reactions that we knew were being cheated by the incompetency & poor knowledge of the ground staff at scoots check-in counter, as well the scoots personnel working at the departing gate without any sympathy to offer any special assistance that would have saved the day for this disabled wheelchair old great-grand mother.

And this poor old lady has had to suffer such great physical & mental stress to board bus, walk to plane and climb onto the stairways while she is supposedly to enjoy a care-free holiday break to celebrate her 92 years-old birthday, where all of us travelling with her as well to bear the devastated event encountered.

We are carefully and reconsidering to engage Scoots for future business or leisure travel due to the incompetency & poor reaction and services."

For me then to have to spend £300 on changing my name on a ticket I paid for... They were then supposed to refund me as I spoke to gotogate and got an email from Scoot saying the refund was successful. Then spoke to staff multiple times on their live chat to be told it had been refunded.. but to a random card that was definitely not mine and never used in the payment process. Service was awful as a first time traveller. I didn't expect to spend a couple thousand to be on a budget airline with no water, uncomfortable seats. No staff service unless I pulled them aside to pay for water... on 3 flights totalling 26 hours bearing in mind. In regards to my refund I waited for 2months with chasing up. They recently got back to me and said they don't refund... which is a straight lie if I was told the refund was successful but through the wrong card.. Genuinely disgusting service.

With singapore airlines many times on there airbus 380 and the service was always 10/10, I am 85 and the courtesy extended to me was just the greatest, I am sorry for the company as they have shot themselves in the foot when they decided to buy this aircraft, looks like Malaysia airlines will get me as a customer in future,"

We flew on a 13h30 flight from Singapore to Berlin and the level of service was just unbelievable, even for a low cost!
They don’t give you ANY food or drink for such a long haul flight, not even a glass of water. Even the blankets you need to pay for!
worse: staff actually passes through cabin giving out blankets and drinks to
those who paid extra in advance, but give absolutely nothing and no attention to all other passengers.
Seats are small and uncomfortable, so being 1,95m tall i asked if I could pay for a larger seat but the staff, who spoke very poor english, simply said “NO”.
there is no on-flight entertainment nor charging stations, so you’ll need a power bank if you want to bring your on entertainment on a long haul flight.

Scoot,LOUSY EXPERIENCE,1,"Last August 15 my flight was going from Jakarta to Singapore. The day before, August 14, I tried to check in through the company's website, but I got a notice that all passengers had already checked in, so I had to go to the airport to try to do it the same day of the flight. I arrived 3 hours before the flight and to my surprise the panels at the airport did not show the counter where I had to do it, so I had no choice but to wait. Time passed and still no news. With 2 hours to go, I looked at all the counters, but there was no sign of either the company or the plane. When I finally managed to reach a SCOOT employee, there was only 1 hour left and I still had no boarding pass, so I explained my situation to her without success. Furthermore, she called me a liar saying I had not shown up 3 hours before departure as I said. While I kept asking for help, the airport boards showed that boarding had started, so the SCOOT employee's posture changed and she just told me that there was nothing she could do since boarding was in progress and the gates had closed. CONCLUSION: I was left in a country with no solutions, having to buy another ticket and with options of missing the next connecting flight to get to my destination."

Scoot,Still waiting for my refund nearly 3 months later,1,"Scoot unilaterally changed my flight date to 3 days earlier for ""operation reason"", and said I can either take this new flight or get a refund.

It's now been over 2 months (nearly 3 months) and I'm STILL waiting for my refund of several hundred £. I've called them every few weeks, and each time, they tell me that my refund is at the ""last stage"" of the process, just pending final manager approval. They tell me it'll be 15 days, but they tell me this each time they miss this deadline. They won't let me talk to a manager, and they won't let me contact the refunds team directly. One time, they even falsely claimed they'd paid my refund months ago! (Turned out they'd mixed up and mis-recorded claim numbers - so unprofessional.)

Scoot has missed its own refund deadline of 30 business days, which is also set out in law, by a huge margin. Upon my latest call today, they said they'll refund me within 3-4 weeks - despite having already failed to pay for nearly 3 months. I'm sick of hearing that they'll refund me as soon as possible, when clearly they are incapable of meeting their own deadlines.

Terrible customer service and, more than that, seemingly incapable of complying with their own legal obligations."
Scoot,Complete scam,1,"Complete scam. They cancelled my flight, promised a refund to me in an email but haven’t sent me the money. Every time I call they say they have no recollection of that email, so I’ll forward the email back to them whilst on the phone then they hang up on me. I’m raising the issue with ombudsman.

I have been calling and emailing multiple times over the last 2 months and my flight is supposed to be tomorrow but I still get no response from them."
Scoot,hung up on me several times,1,Requested to cancel and rebook flights after i purchased them just half hour ago due to their website malfunction. Have been on the phone with them for 3 hours as they have been hanging up on me when they asked me to hold or when they are checking something with another department. Really indecent customer service and completely regret booking with them. please avoid.
Scoot,Very worst u r scoot airlines customer…,4,Very worst u r scoot airlines customer service not attending call
Scoot,Don’t use this airline. Pay more for trouble-free travel,1,"Don’t use this airline the seats are tiny and they cut everything, even if it has no cost to them. We’ve had four bad flight experiences with them and all the check in staff were always rude.

They also don’t follow their own rules, they refused to check us in 65 minutes before a flight, but their policy was 60 minutes. They just can’t be trusted and it is very inhumane they won’t even give you free water onboard if you feel sick.

This airline goes beyond ‘budget’ to inhumane and they have loads of staff that are incompetent too."
Scoot,Scoot Airline,1,I booked a ticket from Singapore Changi to London Gatwick for 16th of June 2022. I received and email from Scoot on 13of May 2022. They wanted to change my flight on 21st of June 2022 which was impossible to change for me. Because I already planned my journey. After that they said they will refund me. I am still waiting for my refund. Many times i called them. It has been more than 2 months. Still no clear answer. None of their customers service representative were helpful. The only thing they’ve done apologized. I will never flight with them again. When I checked the reviews these kind of issues very normal for Scoot. Many people had same problem with them. Most probably I will not get refund from them. All I wanted if someone wants to buy a ticket from them don’t do that. I made a mistake to choose them please don’t do same mistake like me.
Scoot,North Korean esque,1,"I am an American citizen who mistakenly purchased a flight ticket with Scoot Airlines to travel from Athens, Greece to Ha Noi, Vietnam back in April of this year. Prior to my flight, I completed all required documentation/applications/tests. At the airport, I asked the Scoot check-in counter to confirm whether my documentation was sufficient (showing her my visa status confirmation code and explaining that I did not receive any separate confirmation back from Vietnam). This Scoot representative assured me that my documentation was sufficient. I then embarked on an almost empty flight full of what can only be described as a crew of intensely creepy disney-esque robots who spent the whole flight smiling and giving each other thumbs up. When you combine this with the complete lack of food, water, and electricity provided on the flight, you can't help but feel like you're on an eerie North Korean airline in disguise.

Upon arrival in Vietnam, I was told by Vietnamese immigration that my visa was in fact not actually processed and that I was being deported back to the originating country (i.e. another 20+ hr flight back to Greece without any food/water/electricity). The Vietnamese immigration associates then literally ran with my passport back onto the Scoot airplane so that I was forced to follow them. As these immigration associates did not speak English, I asked the Scoot Airline stewards (individuals named Stanley and Bosch Wong) to explain to me what the hell was going on. They stood there like stoic gargoyles just staring into space and refused to translate even though they spoke both languages. Instead, their demeanor quickly turned from chipper stewards to cold prison guards. I was without wifi in the taxi’d airplane and they refused to provide me with any way to communicate to my friends and family, including all those who were waiting for me at baggage claim. Instead, they just stared at me—not even offering a tissue as they stared at me crying in confusion. The flight then took off on the return journey back. During the total 42 hour consecutive flight journey, Scoot airlines denied me food, water, and electricity to power my electronics. They degraded and traumatized me by the very public and embarrassing escort of me by their officials onto and off of both the layover flight back to Singapore and subsequent connecting flight back to Athens, as well as through both airports.

But it gets worse—They reported me to the Singaporean authorities—well knowing that this entire situation stemmed from a system issue on Vietnam’s part as I had showed them my confirmation proof. Why does this matter? Well because in Singapore you get thrown into a detention facility if you’re not wanted there, and that’s exactly what happened during my layover. It was an eye-opening experience to see just how quickly you, a well-educated successful American businesswoman, can spiral down into the lowest depths of society as the Singaporean security guard forces you to remove any items from your body that put you at risk of killing yourself and where nutrients come in the form of a single cup of noodles with dirty lukewarm water. Note that was the only form of food I was given within 42 hours. In the detention facility, I met prostitutes, criminals, and seemingly run of the mill average Chinese visitors who, because of paperwork issues, were forced to stay in that tiny windowless box for a month without work or basic essentials while waiting on China to reprocess…and here I was complaining about my 2.5 hr layover.

Human rights violations aside, things were still going extremely bad for myself. I had critical medication in my checked luggage, and I was assured 8 times from various Scoot representatives that my luggage would be back with me in Athens upon my return. News flash: it wasn’t. The pseudo North Korean Scoot representatives lied. This included Shauna Rasheesh, a Scoot manager who gave me her word well knowing my critical health condition and need for this medication. As a result, I had to wait in Athens for 4 days ---all because of the fu*kery of these goons.

For those of you who are tempted to use Scoot airlines, just don’t. It’s honestly not worth it. There’s a reason Scoot’s seats are empty. It’s honestly worth the extra $300 to choose a flight that will not add to the already stressful endeavor of flying—a flight with competent stewards you can rely on or at the very least, will not treat you like crap. It’s not worth the risk of things going wrong (missing luggage, missing flights, etc) because this airline DOES NOT CARE about customer satisfaction. You only have so much time on this planet—don’t waste it on the emotional trauma that will undoubtedly come with this airline."
Scoot,Perfectly fine,4,"Had a totally fine trip from bkk to lgw. Only issue was that there was a long line to check in and they served the only meal almost immediately so most people had to buy more snacks and food. Otherwise great value for the money. You don't get entertainment but just download music, films etc on your phone beforehand."
Scoot,Value your health ...,1,"Ok so i developed covid symptoms yesterday/overnight, thus singapore won't permit access. However they insist you fly or go as no show... their policy says can only cancel with doctors proof... bearing in mind test is 24-48 hours to come back... and can't see doctor without a negative result.. as such the process doesn't work. They also suggested I rat test and just fly if negative (even though I have symptoms.....) I will be avoiding this airline in future, my health isn't worth a few hundred buck saving.... get with the times scoot and think about your customers... I actually called the call centre twice to check directions were the same, the customer service attitudes are terrible also..."
Scoot,I would be embarrassed to be a CEO or shareholder in Scoot,1,"Postponed and then cancelled our flight two weeks in advance. Didn't even tell me that they had cancelled our outbound flight only received an email saying the return was cancelled. I found out the outbound was cancelled as I could not access my booking so I send a message to their customer service, who informed me whilst also being very rude. Would not recommend and will never fly scoot or singapore airlines. Embarrassing service"
Scoot,Dreadful service,1,"Dreadful service, flights postponed, and then cancelled. Do not use if you can avoid it. Impossible to get follow-up information from the company"
Scoot,Flight from London to Singapore,1,"Flight from London to Singapore, then to Manila.
Zero food or water offered, was very uncomfortable.
My flight back to Manila was delayed twice and so I missed the scoot Manila to Singapore flight and the Scoot staff were extremely unhelpful and said there's nothing they can do to help me and won't transfer me, I simply sat at the airport with no food or water until the following afternoon and had to borrow £1300 to pay for flights back to the UK.
The Scoot staff could not have been worse and as a customer I would obviously have expected them to at least care. I hadn't been on a plane for 26 years and thought it would have been far better. I ended up flying back with Emirates who were really good and the staff were helpful.
I'll never ever use Scoot again!"
Scoot,Worst flight I have ever been on,1,"Worst flight I have ever been on. 12 hours travelling from Bangkok to London without food, water, a charging socket or entertainment system. My friends had their flight rescheduled without being told, and had to pay again to get on my flight.

If you want to feel like a sardine for 12 hours, by all means 'scoot'."
Scoot,This airline is the worst!,1,"This airline is the worst!! We called in on June 26th to book luggage for our flight on July 6th. The agent we spoke to said that we didn't have to worry about it, that we each had a bag included with our tickets, in addition to our carry-ons. We asked multiple times to be clear, so there would be no confusion. He said that even if we had to purchase at the airport it would be about the same price. Well, we got to the airport the day of our flight only to find out that no, we didn't have luggage, and they wanted to charge us another 60 myr per leg of our flight per checked bag (180 myr per leg instead of 120). Which is another 240 myr! We spent an hour trying to sort out the issue. We said we would be happy to pay the 120, because obviously had we known we didn't have baggage included we would have purchased it on the spot when we made the original phone call. They refused to honor the price we ought to have been charged, due to the miscommunication on the side of the Scoot employee. So because the employee was wrong, we had to spend another 240 myr on top of our base flight ticket. We are both very frustrated and upset by the way this was handled by Scoot."
Scoot,FlyScoot,1,"FlyScoot

I am sharing this experience publicly from my private profile. I had been lucky to go on a business trip from london to Singapore.

At my own responsibility I’ve taken a 40 mins direct flight to Kuala Lumpur, by the airline that’s part of Singapore Airlines called Fly Scoot.

Everything was fine, until I have not seen my luggage came through of the luggage claims after hours. I reported it at the Kuala Lumpur Airport airport and warnings went out including Changi Airport and KL international airport too, it’s been 20 days now, and not a proper response from anywhere.

I keep calling the customer service’s number day-n-out, yet they “have no visibility over this” - they say. The most shocking thing is that after providing all evidence, and filling out the long forms - I am the one having to contact them. Plus, I should call the airport lost luggage service - at my own costs…🤌 (only if I ever go through them and it’s my fault it’s lost) but is it not Fly Scoot’s responsibility?

I do understand there is a lot of claims, but if you have not got enough personnel do not take the amount of passengers so you can service the ones that pay for not only a flight but their luggage too.

It gets worst. As arrived late in the evening I had no proper shoes, so I was unable to get a flip flop due to this suffered long term feet Injuries see the photo below for your reference.

The worst of the worst the first contact email was a compensation to a passenger that is not me in the first place. See below.

🤣 then what hopes I get to even find out is it lost - or stolen luggage? just say you are unable to find them then it’s much easier to take you on from all jurisdictions inc UK, SG and MY.

Let alone the valuables lost but the physical harm, distress caused it’s possibly tipping over the actual values were in that luggage.

I immediately need your assistance. It’s too much of an inconvenience by now.

Any other passengers compromised please contact me happy to give you the right contact details, and happy to guide you through the endless reports and forms to submit. Any effort to form an alliance to contact a media outlet happy to lure you in. Be it delayed flight or poor service. I got the worst! Feel free to share and comment. Passaneger support appreciated.

Best regards,

Scoot,I am a Krisflyer member and was…,5,"I am a Krisflyer member and was attempting to book a flight for 6 people from singapore to kota kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia online. The online form would not accept my booking because one of the passengers krisflyer profile did not match identically to the passport details. So I had to call customer service to check how to resolve the problem and book the flight.
Taufiq was extremely polite and patient and spent the time to come up with a workable solution. A big shout out to him. I then needed to follow up with seating and had a few other arrangements to make. Again the link from Singaporeair.com to scoot just kept on looping so another phone call to achieve this goal. This time Sharleen was extremely patient and polite.
Moral of the story, the online experience can be improved no end, particularly if you wish it to substitute for silkair, and not allow krisflyer members to book through the Singapore air website. But the training that customer services staff had, their patience and politeness is something not always found in Asia. so Big round of applause even though it would have been nice to have done it all quicker online."
Scoot,worse experience I had in a long distance flight,1,"I don't know where to start. I am very unhappy with this trip. First, you changed the schedule 3 hours earlier, what meant I had to book an extra flight because I would have missed the conection with the one I had booked. Customer services offered no solution at all. UNRELIABLE is the word I would use to describe Scoot.
Then, once we were boarding, they tell us food isn't included and we should go shopping for food back to the terminal. It was only 20 mins left for the boarding, and I would have risked to miss the flight. It also departed and arrived over one hour late.
It's the first time that I am in a flight so long hours and there isn't food included. It wasn't even water available. Aren't you aware how dangerous that is? Also, first time that in this kind of flights there isn't a tv or a charger slot available on the seats.
The icing on the cake was how unpolite the crew was. One of them came to the person seating next to me who was asleep, pointing with the torch to his face because the mask slid out of his nose while sleeping, shouting at him to wake him up. And he was being super unpolite to him, even when he put the mask back, he was telling him off because the guy was covering his face of the torch and he didn't see the mask was back. Very unconfortable. By far the worse experience I had in a long distance flight."
Scoot,Never again. Free date change - a cheap marketing gimmick,1,"Booked a flight to Sydney because of the ""free date change"" perk, which is a total misrepresentation. Couldn't travel on my original dates. However, no flight schedules are published for the intended future travel dates. Customer service reps are totally incompetent and are not able to provide any specific details. Not a pleasant experience."
Scoot,Awful service,1,"Awful service! Online check-in super demanding, you don’t understand a word at the service number, receiving the boarding pass in advance not possible"
Scoot,"Sorry sir, but your flight already left",1,"We arrived at Bangkok Airport for our return flight home 3 hours early, but we're told that our flight had already left 2 hours ago. There were at least 10 other people who were in the same situation as us. It seems that Scoot had informed all passengers who had booked directly through them, but not the ones who had booked with third party sites. Airport staff told us that this has been happening on every scoot flight for the past two months. Called Scoot, but they told us that there was nothing they could do for the 10 stranded people. Called our agent site and were told that the flight was still as scheduled and that there was no notice about the time change. So no help and stranded half way round the world. Staff at the airport, eventually agreed to book us in on the Scoot flight two days later, but we had to cover hotel costs, expenses and loss of work for two days ourselves. This has happend to hundreds of people, so I can only say, never again."
Scoot,Super easy and very nice contact,5,Super easy and very nice contact. The scooters were new and driving them made so much fun.
Scoot,Worst customer service and late flights!,1,"Worst customer service and flight was delayed even though it was on the tarmac for ages with no explanation given!

If you try complain to them all they do is keep sending generic copy and paste messages back. If you catch covid and require a refund you are screwed as they make it impossible for you to get your money back. They are trying to copy ryan air but copy them in all the wrong ways that they shouldn't be famous for!"
Scoot,Overcharged me for my extra luggage…,1,"Overcharged me for my extra luggage even though i was entitled to it, do not travel with them if you have the slightest chance of avoid it."
Scoot,Scoot...What a horrible airline,1,"What a horrible airline Scoot is...in March of 2019 I flew to Bangkok to pick up our son... the evening before leaving they cancelled the flight. 2 days later border's closed around the world. It cost me $1295 to fly home, alone. I got my airfares refunded months later. I flew back with them on 9th June 2022... I was transiting from phuket to Bangkok that evening and told the ground crew on Gold Coast who marked both my boarding passes transiting. The flight from Singapore was 45-50 minutes late... I was carrying cabin baggage only. The cabin crew insisted I stow the bag... I explained the situation and they assured me it would be OK. As the flight progressed the pilot indicated that we would land now slightly more than 1 hour late. I approached the cabin manager and we discussed the situation for a long period. She assured me that she would contact their ground staff who would have my bag ready and escort me quickly to my transit flight. She made it clear that this was Scoots fault....None of this happened... I had to wait for my bag at the carousel and ground crew assistance was zero. Subsequently I missed my flight by 4 minutes and 30 seconds. Purely by luck and having travelled extensively I found the last flight out of Phuket that night. I had a car booked and 4 nights hotel accommodation. I lost my original fare and car transport and it cost me nearly 3 times the cost to get to Bangkok. I lodged a complaint via messenger on FB with their FB page... I have phoned their customer assistance line in Singapore several times... I spoke with their reps at Phuket and Singapore... NOT INTERESTED! FINALLY I SPOKE WITH SCOOT AUSTRALIA... HELPFUL BUT COULD DO NOTHING ALSO. Here is the kicker... I showed loyalty and got another spit in the face! What a horrible airline Scoot is!"
Scoot,We would definitley use Scoot again.,5,"I have to say I cannot agree with the attitude of reviews for Scoot. We flew with them a couple of years ago and they were fantastic. Cheap and cheerful, they get you there fast and in reasonable comfort. Scoot easily beats Easyjet and Ryan Air as budget carriers. The staff at both ends and onboard were very efficient and friendly, we would definitely fly with them again should we be in the Far East again on holiday."
Scoot,Delayed 3 and a half hours from Gatwick…,1,"Delayed 3 and a half hours from Gatwick to Bangkok for no apparent reason. Not enough water for all passengers, ripp off WiFi that doesn't work, poor quality food. The worst was the return, very unhelpful and rude cabin crew wouldn't even allow an extra legroom seat despite me having am injury very spiteful. Would never use again."
Scoot,beware thieves!!!!!,1,"beware thieves!!!!!! they do everything just not to refund the ticket
Customer service telling me refund been done on same day of request IMPOSSIBLE!!!
Same time they don’t have any proof money been send"
Scoot,Worst airlines ever!!!,1,"Worst airlines ever!!!! Customer service is the worst. Will never fly again with this airline. I bought some pasalubongs after i went through immigration and the staff was questioning my carry-on being too many just because I have one additional paper bag. The staff was so rude and was very judgmental. She even called the person who checked me in and weighed my bag which perfectly fits their limit. They seem to be a cheap flight but after add-ons and adding a luggage, it’s as if buying a regular and way better flight. It’s a mahor ripoff!! Never again! I’ve been flying for over 10 years now and this is the worst airline I’ve been on!!"
Scoot,It was around the date I wanted to go…,1,It was around the date I wanted to go to Thailand and it was quite cheap . So I booked . Went to Gatwick . Got on the Plane . Waited 2 Hours on the Plane and then the Flight was simply Cancelled !!!! No explanation . This is the worst airline that you could ever create in your nightmares !!! DO NOT BOOK !!!!!!
Scoot,Fantastic airline,5,"Fantastic airline, great service and timekeeping, Faultless service from Cabin crew very helpful, being able to carry 55kg each with Scoot plus perfect for us, it helps if people read the terms and conditions before traveling,
Will definitely book London to Bangkok again Thank you."
Scoot,DAY LIGHT ROBBERY!!!,1,I’m going travelling and don’t need my luggage because I’m going backpacking and my bag is small and will fit as a carry on. I just wanted a refund because I will not be using the luggage at all and they are refusing to refund this. This is a lot of money for me and I feel like I’m being robbed. Has anyone been in this situation and is there anything I can do to get my money back?
Scoot,Please whatever you do DO not book with…,1,"Please whatever you do DO not book with this airline. I was fooled and thought that it couldn’t be be that bad, then we noticed they had changed our flight back by 3 days when we went to look at the booking (they never even told us this). They are so so awful, please just take it from me not to do it!"
Scoot,Five stars for being horrendous,1,"As one person wrote below (for a totally separate flight and booking!!) they cancelled and changed our flight departure by three days and didn't inform us. We only found out by chance when we went to see if we could check in!!

The flight we were rebooked onto was then delayed by a further 2 hours. They also brought our return flight forward by over 4 hours. Overall we lost over 75 hours of our planned holiday and Scoot's customer service have been beyond dire, they have broken EU and UK law and have only said they ""cannot accede to our request at this time"".

They are awful, awful, awful. The prices may be cheap but honestly, pay £50-£100 more for peace of mind that you won't lose your planned holiday and get treated like meaningless moneybags. The paid features are not worth it. And to top it off, during my twelve hour flight the seat recliner was broken.

Five stars for:
Feeling stressed
Feeling undervalued as a customer
Terrible customer service
Inflight discomfort
Food that is 90% mushy rice (and I love rice)
Departing late
Being a floating can of sardines with just as many amenities

Honestly please don't fly with them, no matter how much you need to save your money, it just is NOT worth it."
Scoot,The budget of the budgetest airlines,1,"The budget of the budgetest airlines

This airline is so budget that its website throws errors half the time and you need to try managing your booking later.

This airline is so budget, it takes 30 business days for your money to come back after a refund has already been approved. Not for approving it, mind you... this is just for the money to come back AFTER approval is successful. And it's business days! Not regular days! So a good 2 months until you get your money back! Like what are you doing with my money? Are you keeping it and earning interest on it in the mean time or something?

This airline is so budget, it took me googling multiple sources and a good 30 minutes to find out how much cabin luggage I'm allowed because their website is so bad.

This airline is so budget that my chat with their live customer support expired while I was actively messaging them. The reason being that they haven't heard back from me for longer than 2 minutes... when my last message was literally 10 seconds before I got disconnected.

The airline is so budget that when you first connect to a live chat to talk to support, they make you fill out a form with all required details and description of your issue. But then when the support agent connects, they ask you for the same details AGAIN!

I never ended up flying with them. And I never will. The experience pre-flight (as well as the refund experience) have completely turned me off of this airline. I'll happily pay the extra 50-100 to another airline for the same route. No way I'd ever risk flying with these guys."
Scoot,"online check in not possible, hotline no help",1,absolute choas even before departure. online check-in is not possible and the hotline cannot help either. not recommendable. you start your holiday stressed out.
Scoot,Not worth it!,2,"I read all the reviews before booking and decided to go for it anyway as the flights were so cheap. The airline changed both my flights, one of them with a 1 hour difference in take off time and the other with a 9 hour difference which would have mean that I’d be spending my entire birthday on a plane, would have to pay for an extra night in a hotel and that I would miss the start of my tour in Sydney. When I tried to cancel the flights the live chat agent first told me my flight had been rescheduled and asked if I needed help with anything else even though I had clearly explained that I needed a refund. The agent then asked me to wait a moment for them to find the details and didn’t respond for an hour, I sent two messages asking if they were still there and received no response. The only reason I’ve given them 2 stars is because the second chat agent I spoke to was very lovely and sorted my problem in less than 5 minutes. I’m not sure that I’ll actually see the refund but I was told they were passing it on to the refund team (so finger crossed)."
Scoot,-1000 stars of 5,1,-1000 stars of 5. The worst. NEVER consider this shady company. They should be out of business and/or in jail for their practices.
Scoot,If I could give them zero stars I would…,1,"If I could give them zero stars I would

3hrs to check in as No staff, Charged me for changing my flight when it is supposed to be free, didn’t receive my meal I paid for and the internet didn’t work. You couldn’t make it up. Let’s hope they pull this airline."
Scoot,they canceled my return flight without…,1,they canceled my return flight without even telling me. they did not offer an alternative or any help at all. I was stranded at Bangkok Airport and had to pay £500 to another airline for a one-way ticket home. Do not fly with them no matter how cheap the price seems to be. their planes are very old and falling apart. I wouldn't be surprised if one of them crashes soon.
Scoot,Moved my flight by 3 days,1,Moved my flight by 3 days so I have had to cancel. They lure you in with cheap flights but make adjustments and ruin your trip
Scoot,"Flight changed by them last minute, no customer help at all",1,"We had read bad reviews about how they don't give any food to people during the long flights, but we thought that it was not so bad. What we didn't expect was them to cancel our flight just a month in advance! They put us on a different flight 2 days later, which of course altered our whole journey because it was not just a few hours change..it was 2 days! They sent an email saying you could get a refund or voucher using a link, but the link doesn't work and their phone doesn't work either. Therefore, we were left without any options but to cancel accommodation, rebook, reschedule flights, which costed us hundreds. They have flights every 2 days, so what we suspect happened is that not enough people booked for our same flight, so they dumped us on another one to save money. They're not reachable to ask them for an explanation. Thanks Scoot. That's the first and last time."
Scoot,SHAME OF AN AIRLINE! SCAM!,1,"I had booked a return flight London - Bangkok back in March, leaving on 2 June and was randomly checking details on their website in 'Manage my booking' when I found out they had moved my flight to 5 June so 3 days later! I received no communications whatsoever (neither in my spams). After spending hours on the phone with them and via the online chat, Scoot is still REFUSING to send me an email confirmation with the changed flight details so that I can make a claim with my insurance. I have requested a refund but who knows if I'll ever see my money back! When I asked why my original flight was cancelled I was told it's due to 'operational constraints' which makes zero sense and is just a BS excuse. Scoot sells flight tickets they know won't actually be operating just to get your money and f*** you over. Literally no other flights days before and after the date I had booked. Being now 2 weeks away from the date I'm supposed to travel, other flights are way more expensive! The biggest waste of time and money I've ever experienced with an airline. The irony is that the first thing you see when you go on their website is this message 'Book with confidence' and they are literally the most unreliable and unhelpful airline! Don't waste your energy and money with Scoot!"
Scoot,"I'm not flying till 5th Jul but already 0 stars and almost robbed! Don't give them your card details, don't book with them directly!",1,"Ok so I tried to book a flight Gatwick-BKK 2 days ago via google. Goodle asks who do you want to buy the flight with? Scoot, last minute, gotogate... I go for Scoot. I fill my card details and the website says card unrecognised 🤷🏻‍♂️ Ok I thought, so I go back and book via lastminute.com, done (2days ago).

Scoot,72 hours I have been waiting in the…,1,72 hours I have been waiting in the airport following Scoots instructions now realising the information they gave is wrong. I just hope the lady who didn't care at the time realise that whilst she has been sleeping in your soft bed I have been on hard seats and the floor. They do not care they will tell you anything just to get rid of you so they can go home. Shocking service I only wished I looked at their reviews before booking its crazy how a company can still operate under terrible advice? To all fellow travellers please go elsewhere pay the extra and enjoy your holiday
Scoot,Scoot STOLE MY MONEY,1,"Scoot STOLE MY MONEY. On the 25th of April Scoot did 3 unauthorized transactions with my credit card for a total amount of around $300, after my flight and after losing my baggage.
On the same day, I wrote them emails with my booking number and data about my transactions and contacted the support many times.
After 10 days they asked me for the booking number that I sent them in the very first email.
After another week they asked me for the documents of the transactions that I already sent in the first and second emails."
Scoot,OVERCHARGED £200 FOR FOOD... AVOID,1,"Firstly, the flight was moved at very short notice to 4 hours earlier meaning we had to readjust our plans... but ok, i can live with that.

On flight you have to pay for your food... which is mediocre at best. It's expensive as it is... 2 hot meals and 2 snacks which are pretty awful cost £22.

But I get home the next day to check my bank statement to discover I have been charged £200+ for the food and beverage on flight. One correct charge and one charge for £181 which is completely random. On flight, they take your card away and do the charge themselves... so perhaps this is a sneaky way of literally robbing people for their money.

After 2 hours of live chat this morning, their customer service has said they can't see the charge their end so can't refund it... which now leaves me in the situation of being £200 down and wondering whether it's worth the time and energy to take them to court.

I'm genuinely disgusted that this has happened. Daylight robbery.

I can quite firmly say I will never ever use this airline again"
Scoot,AWFUL,1,"AWFUL, flight was moved two hours earlier with no notice except an email about our return flight time changing, which stated other flights may be affected. Incredibly unclear formatting. We received full refund but didn’t cover the cost of the new last minute flights we had to book"
Scoot,Terrible airline extremely bad food…,1,"Terrible airline extremely bad food that is they have food as they ran out, no inflight entertainment on a 13 hour flight, they have an app that doesn't work, charge for everything even things like charging your phone, and no leg room as an example the guy next to me was about 5 ft and his knee was touching the chair in front.

It just not worth it even if it saves you money, I didn't realise that you where allow to offer this level of service on long hall flights."
Scoot,Please please NEVER use this airline,1,"Don’t use this airline unless you want to be stranded in Bangkok.

We flew from London > Bangkok with Scoot on 12th April, all was fine apart from a couple of hours delay and an email a few weeks pre departure letting us know the flight time would be moved forward by 3 hours (fine).

However, our return flight to London was when the nightmare began. On Thursday 21st April we arrived at the airport for 12pm (2.30pm flight) to find check in desk was closed and wasn’t expected to open till 2.30pm, the flight also wasn’t on the departure board which we thought was strange so we called the airline to find the flight actually left on Tuesday 19th April and the next flight wasn’t until Sunday 24th April, we received NO email or communication to mention this was the case, they were so unhelpful, we spoke to Sema who said there’s nothing they can do, no apology and you’ll basically have to find your own way back to London and then hung up after being on the phone for 1hour 10 mins (with a 30 min wait on hold!). We couldn’t access “Manage my booking” online where apparently this was change communicated

Unfortunately we weren’t the only ones in this position on the day, there were a number of customers at the desk with us waiting and in the same position.

After this, we had no option to purchase a new flight with Qatar Airlines for £637!!

Since being back to London we have called the airline and they are so unhelpful and basically can’t do anything (again!) which then ends in them hanging up on you."
Scoot,I know no words for disgusting airline,1,"I know no words for disgusting airline! The bad reviews below are true! Rude and threating not to let me on the plane because I said to my sister that I the lady isn’t listening. I asked for water at the start of the fight and never got it or any drinks for that matter. I was starving the whole time.
Then the return was moved three days before it was due to leave and didn’t inform anyone on the flight . So we had to buy a new ticket. The staff had no information, they wouldn’t or couldn’t do any thing to help."
Scoot,No help whatsoever,2,"Tried to fly with Scoot recently from Berlin to Athens (it then flies on to Singapore). Unfortunately it took a while to get through Berlin immigration so we arrived at the check in desk at 1011, when their check in desk closes at 1010 (60 minutes before departure). We had already checked in via the web but because they check COVID documents at the check in desk, not at the gate, you can't use transit security if simply connecting from another flight, even though we had no luggage to check in.
Anyway, we then went to see Scoot's ground agent, Wisag, and the girl there just said ""you are late, you will need to buy another ticket for tomorrow's flight"". We only really needed a boarding pass.
Here's the clincher: that flight always leaves Berlin late. In our case, it left 2h26 behind schedule, so despite the fact we were at check in at 1011, told we couldn't get the flight, the aircraft didn't leave Berlin until 1336. Fortunately we managed to get another flight with Ryanair later that day.
The person I was travelling with tried to get Scoot on their online chat, but was cut off.
It is amazing to think that this airline is owned by Singapore Airlines who in the past have been excellent to me.
I've given them two stars as I have to acknowledge that we were technically late for check in (by one minute). The rest is on Scoot. They were no help at all."
Scoot,Ok so I have just flown with scoot,5,"Ok so I have just flown with scoot, gatwick to bangkok, seen a lotvof negative reviews ,this is a budget airline, I had no problems with check in ,flight took of late but this happens ,staff very helpful on board, WiFi works well, food and drinks can be ordered from your phone, no entertainment but again its a budget airline, I had my battery pack and pad things to watch, the flights are very cheap ,the food on board is ok and as i said the onboard staff are so helpful, yes going out there flight left an hour late, but coming back only 10 mins late, I would definitely fly with them again and if you looking for a cheap flight they are well worth it and they are direct."
Scoot,Worst flight experience ever- LGW to…,1,"Worst flight experience ever- LGW to BKK.

Check in was a real mess not enough staff and the ones there did not understand Thai pass procedure and did not accept electronic proof, people were charged 5 gbp a page for printing.

Consequently departure well over two hours late the captain tried to blame clocks changing and passengers were arriving late ~ utter rubbish.

No entertainment, poor choice of refreshments that all have to be paid for, even power had to be paid for, soft drinks tea coffee all had to be paid for absolutely nothing included

I prepaid paid for two internet packages but could not use, as the passcode is emailed to you before hand and could not retrieve without internet.

I paid for a sleep pack, blanket, pillow and ear plugs and eyeshades - got a tissue thin blanket but the crew told me the other items were not loaded .

The crew were very sorry took my details for a refund but of course I heard nothing .

If you are an 18 year back packer this might be suitable for you to save a few pounds, otherwise I advise go somewhere else by the time you paid for luggage, seat location, food , water etc you are really not saving much

Never again I accept some responsibility I should of researched better, it was a quick one way booking that suited my departure airport time and date, I also wanted a non stop flight . I did not imagine anything could be so much torture from check until arrival 15 hours of hell."
Scoot,They won't give you water!,1,"Unfortunately they don't mention that they don't provide free power charging on international flights, in flight entertainment or even WATER.

For the love of god just incorporate #15 more into the flight charge to cover the costs of basic human necessities."
Scoot,Appalling,1,"I flew from LGW to BKK on 27th March. Despite arriving to the airport more than 3 hours early, it took over two hours to check in - simply because there weren’t enough agents to deal with everyone’s additional Covid paperwork. It’s been two years, surely this isn’t unexpected?! Nonetheless, this didn’t matter anyway as the flight was nearly 3 hours late departing owing to its late arrival.

I paid extra for an aisle seat, and was allocated one at the back of the plane. I wasn’t notified during the booking stage, but it turns out the back row is flush against the rear bulkhead and cannot recline. Fearful of sitting at a 90 degree angle with the passenger in front of me reclined on my lap for 13 hours I asked to move. This was met with disinterest until I offered to pay. Another $82 SGD later I could recline! Despite taking payment for my seat change and taking me to the new seat the attendants failed to bring the meal I pre paid, presumably someone near my old seat benefited from a free dinner.

After landing 3 hours late, hungry yet excited to be in Bangkok I cleared the Covid procedures and immigration very quickly and headed to the baggage carousel. I waited and waited yet the bag I queued for 2+ hours to check in never arrived. The ground staff filled out a form and sent me on my way with my clothes and toiletries seemingly in the ether. It has now been 75 hours and I’ve still yet to receive my luggage. Moreover, I have not had a single piece of correspondence from the airline. Not even a simple “We’re sorry your bag is delayed, this is what we’re doing to rectify the situation”. NOTHING.

I’ve never experienced such appalling customer service. Sadly I have my return flight to look forward to, however after that I will never be using this poor excuse for an airline again."
Scoot,Awful rubbish,1,"This is a not fly company is a association of criminals, tried to contact the customer service and it was impossible, 45 minutes on the phone no answer, I can't access their website and check my booking....today (12 May 2022) I discovered that my flight was cancelled and rescheduled to a new date without to receive any notification, I discovered it just checking on the app, that couldn't even let me login, because with this pseudo flight company nothing works, I am asking now to be reimbursed as I cannot flight to the dates they have imposed me without my acceptance, I will involve my credit card company too to obtain the reimbursement.....AVOID THESE CRIMINALS AT ANY COST...."
Scoot,Worst experience with tickes upgrade,1,"I recently purchased air tickets (long-haul flights) for my mother.
Straight after, I decided to purchase (upgrade) the best seat for her with 50% extra legroom (as advertised) on the 1st aisle. So, I had to pay an extra €120.

For some reason, my mother received a ticket with a different seat with only 30% extra legroom (as advertised). The difference between the two seat upgrades was €33.

I contacted Scoot and requested a refund, they only opened my case and provided me with a reference number.

I have been waiting already more than a fortnight, but haven’t received any refund or further update. So, I had to call 3 times and talked to different Scoot consultants, but unfortunately with no positive outcome.

Based on the above-mentioned experience, I strongly do not recommend dealing with Scoot Airlines."
Scoot,Do not use,1,"We booked with Scoot thinking they would be as reliable as Singapore Airlines. We then proceeded to book domestic flights and hotel.

A couple of weeks later we received an email stating they had changed our return flight to a couple of hours earlier.
After then logging into the website, we found our departing flight had also been changed to 3 days prior!! We couldn't travel on these dates and after being on hold for hours, finally got through. They are apparently refunding us but can take 30 days! We have also lost the money for hotel and other flights. The customer service was poor and acted like they didn't care.

Will not use again. Unreliable."
Scoot,SCOOT CALL SOUNDED LIKE AN INDIAN CALL SCAM,1,"i`ve never flown on my own. and not been anywhere in over 13 years. i never thought to check the reviews. and booked the flight. i wanted to cancel it. and now chasing up a refund. they called me from an Indian call centre. they were LAUGHING as i answered the call. so i thought it was a call centre scam until they said they`re calling to confirm the flight. i screwed up. i should have gotten help and checked the reviews. now i`m hoping i get a £544 pound refund !
UPDATE: my bank will open a case against them within 2 weeks. they said thy have an 80% success rate at reclaiming money. but, they said - technically, i have a legit flight. but, i`ve seen comments saying people have turned up to the airport and didn`t have a flight. i`m really hoping i get a refund. and this is a massive life-lesson. ALWAYS CHECK REVIEWS AND ASK FOR HELP BEFORE BOOKING.

2/5/2022 UPDATE - THEY`VE CHANGED THE DATES MULTIPLE TIMES NOW ! AND ADDED A DATE 1 WEEK AFTER I FLY - MEANING `DO I FLY ON THE 24TH ?! OR STILL ON THE 17TH ?!

GO **** YOURSELF FLYSCOOT. I DON`T EVEN KNOW IF I`VE GOT A LEGIT FLIGHT ANYMORE ! I MIGHT HAVE TO CUT MY LOSES AND LOSE £544 ! OR RISK GOING TO THE AIRPORT ONLY TO BE TOLD I DON`T HAVE THE CORRECT FLIGHT INFO ?!

AND I CAN`T GET A REFUND VIA THE BANK

17th MAY UPDATE - the covid test centre screwed me over. giving the wrong test and wrong date. got to the airport - wasn`t allowed to fly ! £660+ gone !

I`VE QUIT FLYING UNTIL THIS S-HIT-SHOW COVID CONSPIRACY ENDS."
Scoot,No refunds allowed with this airline,1,"No refunds allowed with this airline. If they cancel a flight will take 40 business days for a refund.

DO NOT BOOK WITH THESE SCAMMERS!"
Scoot,Traveled with scoot more than 10 times,5,Traveled with scoot more than 10 times. Will do so in the future.
Scoot,Beware...remainder of credit voucher will be forfeited,1,Paid for a flight using a credit voucher expecting to use the remainder ($700AUD) for the return flight....but the remainder is forfeited! It's in the T&C's of the voucher apparently....i call it theft.
Scoot,It's a scam,1,"I wanted to change my flight via the website but it didn't work, so I called the hotline asking for help. When changing flights, you have to obviously pay the difference. On the website it showed a difference of 30 EUR, but when calling they charged me a difference of 70 EUR.

I paid 40 EUR extra because Scoot's website doesn't function properly.

Honestly this is a worse scam than Ryanair. I'm seriously regretting flying with Scoot."
Scoot,Avoid at all cost,1,"I was not let in to my flight from Berlin to Singapore via Athens, as they said that I didn't have a boarding pass. I showed them the mobile boarding pass I had in the scoot app and my allocated seat but that was not accepted.
If a counter only boarding pass is permitted, then it should be clearly stated in red, capitals, exclamation marks etc. AND THE COMPANY SHOULD SUSPEND THE MOBILE BOARDING PASS IF NOT ACCEPTED.
I was standing at my gate on time, with a ticket, a boarding pass, an allocated seat and all the covid documents only to be told that I am not checked in and I cannot be let on board.
Staff was rude and not at all sympathetic. There is no scoot representative at the Berlin airport and nobody to talk to at the airport.
The online chat is worthless too, poor English and not aware of their own policies. After an hour on online chat, I was told exactly the same thing.
Avoid at all cost! I cannot highlight this enough!!!!"
Scoot,SOP says No - Customer Service Unacceptable,1,"17 Feb 2022

Flight Ref: Q7K9YP - Cancellation and Refund Required
Flight Ref: B7HFVM - Good Reference NOT TO BE CANCELLED

I have purchased a ticket from Singapore to Hong Kong. I have incorrectly booked for an incorrect date and I proceeded to change online within the Scoot webpage. When amending this incorrect ticket the system could not pick up flights for the correct date of travel, but I could see that there was availability when booking as a fresh ticket. I proceeded to book as a fresh ticket due to the limited availability and also short time frame to travel and decided to follow up on the cancellation of the original ticket. When speaking to customer services in Singapore I spoke to a lady names Diyana who failed to acknowledge that I needed a refund due to the system issue experienced, I also proved I had bought the correction ticket. Diyana insisted that refund are only possible when Covid positive or cancellations made by the airline due to boarder closures. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that there are no supervisors available.

I have been told to submit a ticket on the Scoot website, but the way this has been handled is totally unacceptable. I now wait for their response on the refund - To be continued......

I have now been messaged a soloution via Face Book Messenger where the second ticket booked (Correct one) can be refunded for Scoot vouchers and the original incorrect ticket can be corrected. What is concerning about this is that I was forced to purchase a Scoot ticket as the only option since Sinagpore Airlines has been blocked entry into Hong Kong. I have requested a call back since when I message back on communicator, I am receiving automated messages back - basically Scoot will avoid speaking to customers where possible.

I am being insisted that compensation is only by vouchers even though this error is a result of their system. I have explained I would not use Scoot if it wasn't for the cancellation of my original flight via Singapore Airlines. I have had some contact via messenger but again it is disgusting when requested for them to call me the request is ignored similar to where I have asked them to escalate this matter to management."
Scoot,It was a nightmare,1,"It was a nightmare. When I went to Scoot check-in counter at Gatwick Airport, the staff there told me my ticket was cancelled. I was not informed by travel agency, nor by Scoot and I was just shocked. I asked the staff in the check-in counter why and they said they did not know because they are not Scoot employees, but a third-vendor for just doing check-in for Scoot. I requested a refund to Scoot and they sent me an email to accept a full refund. However, the refund process has not started yet although it has been over a month now. Please refund my money as soon as possible."
Scoot,Stupidest airline regulations I’ve ever…,1,"Stupidest airline regulations I’ve ever encountered. They ask you to remove your headphones for takeoff and landing for no apparent reason. Besides, aircraft is shaking as if you’re on a bumpy bus ride in the mountains."
Scoot,Scoot is an immoral company,1,"This is an immoral company which buries backdoor inside terms and conditions. I have bought depart-and-return VTL tickets from Scoot. I didn't manage to take the first flight as I was not able to get my PCR report on time. What has astonished me is that Scoot has cancelled my return flight without my acknowledgement. I have called the help center for **multiple times** trying to recover back my return flight, but eventually they rejected to recover the flight, and also rejected to refund me. They blamed me that it was my fault as I didn't notify them my absence for the first flight, and it was written inside the Conditions of Carriage. Scoot is trying to take advantages of its customers by putting strange terms and conditions which are easily to be overlooked for your first read. You could only detect those confusing terms and conditions when accident happens. Imagining that a customer have booked a room from a hotel to stay for multiple days and have made full payment, it is unreasonable and immoral to tell the customer that the booking will become totally void and there will be no refund when the customer fails to check in the room on the arranged date.

I have officially made a refund request at Scoot website. Although it may seem stupid and may not change anything, by all means I am going to make police report and lodge a complaint to Consumers Association due to UNFAIR and UNETHICAL trade practices if I couldn't get a satisfied reply from them within 10 days."
Scoot,Total scam,1,"Total scam!
The website does not work at all. Had to repeat the booking 4 times until it finally worked.
Mobile Check In even worse, does not work in the app, in google chrome it didnt work either (each site of the process would reload every few seconds)..than finally i managed to check in on another browser (after more than 1 hour trying to do the online check in)!
After receiving the message, that the online check in was successful, i didnt pay attention anymore and only on the way to the airport realized that i do not have a mobile ticket! Whats the point of the online check in then??? Well because i was sure i am checked in and i didnt have any luggage i arrived at the airport 1:15 h before the flight and had the unpleasant surprise that i do not have a boarding ticket (whats the point of the online check in then???) ... i found the check-in counter 1 min before closing and of course they would not print my mobile pass anymore, eventhough it was still 1 hour till the flight and the computers were still switched on. Staff was really rude as well. So i could not flight.
Additionally the next day I got another unpleasant surprise: The ""contest"" they offer at the end of their booking is a total scam, now some agency has my phone number and keeps calling and molesting me, plus i get tons of spam mails. Is this how a reputable airline handles my data?"
Scoot,Avoid at all cost,1,"the trip has layover in Singapore.
Then half way, I got an email telling me that the Philippines government has reduced the number of passengers allowed on a plane so my ticket has been cancelled and I have to go and buy another one but the refund will take 5 working days to arrive.

As stupid it sounds, my wife was unwell so I tried calling and stayed behind the call for over 45 minutes while a voice was keep telling me ""my call is important!). the same goes for FB messenger.

The part that had me was that when I looked for alternative flights, I saw the plane I had bought a ticket (which Scoot has cancelled my ticket of) has space to book but the price is 200 pounds higher per seat!

It is completely obvious that they try to make the communication system in a way that you give up and move on so they get to sell a seat twice.
Avoid at all cost"

Got to check in at Hyderabad and they would let me check in because I didn't have a visa.I'm from Australia and connecting transit don't need visas till now due to covid.low and behold scoot said tuff titties to me and I won't get a refund"
Scoot,London to Bangkok,1,"Just spent 1hr45 on a call to get through to Scoot. After 5mins they have just hung up when i wanted to change a flight.

Their website doesn't work showing no flights from London.

Truly awful experience as no-way to change flights despite being told we can change once if Covid issues."

so well done!"
Scoot,Checked luggage scam,1,"Managing my booking online did not allow me to buy more checked luggage, constantly gives error and tells me to buy my luggage at the airport. At the airport I had to pay penalty per kilo. Customer support does nothing to solve the problem. A scam, do not trust the cheap price."
Scoot,They refused to supply water on long trip,1,"What a disgraceful airline , providing water for people on a long journey is an essential and a human right .
This airline can not even have the decency to provide a cup of water to passengers , they require a credit card and not a debit card for payment .
I had an allergy to something on board the airline and I was not feeling well and they refused my request for some water"
Scoot,Horrible customer experience,1,"Sharing my horrible customer experience trying first time to book on SCOOT for a VTL flight Berlin-Singapore for my family (2 adults & 2 kids). During the booking process I was offered the possibility to redeem my KrisFlyer miles to pay part of the fare and I chose this option. Unluckily for me, the payment part went through but KrisFlyer miles redemption part failed due tech issue on their website. After many emails and calls to customer service promising the resolution by end of the day each day (latest being a lady on the call that shouted and aggressively told me to wait for their relevant department to come back), 5 days later and 4 days before the flight I still have an unconfirmed ticket with no assurance that either I will be issued the ticket and miles deducted (non-refundable!) or that the ticket will not be issued and I need to book alternative flights for my family to return to Singapore. Needless to say that during COVID times when approvals, PCR tests etc need to be planned well in advance, this adds additional pressure and stress to already difficult situation."
Scoot,Unacceptable company,1,Unacceptable company! You should not name yourselves a company! We arrived at the airport 10 minutes later because of the train delay and because we had an accident with our baby! The didn’t let us pass the check in and they misled us so we missed the flight (note with a baby)! For 10 minutes delay!!!!!!!!! Shame on you! Your employees also are uneducated with lack of manners!Never travel with this company! Give your money somewhere valuable.
Scoot,Scoot is a lovely cheap company to fly…,5,"Scoot is a lovely cheap company to fly with. They have different routes to south-east Asia and also have some few routes in Europe. I booked a cheap flight from Berlin Germany in the beginning 2020 where covid occurred and due to this my flight got canceled. Hope to fly soon with scoot.
My referral code is JIBCEEC if you want discounted offer tickets"
Scoot,You basically get what you pay for,3,"You basically get what you pay for. Scoot's call center is terrible. I don't think they're even related to Scoot. Scheduling flights, etc. is expensive or impossible (even in light of COVID)."
Scoot,Exploitation!!!!! Threatening staff. Did not let me remove luggage. Took huge maount of money,1,"Advice: Pay a lil more and choose another airline.
They are monsters and blood sucking cheap people. I booked extra 30 kg luggage with them. My hand bag which no other flight weighs, was like 2 kg's more and they charged exorbitant amount and threatened me that they will not let me board if I remove the 2 kg's from my luggage now. At that price I could have taken Singapore airlines which includes meals and has awesome legroom."
Scoot,PAY MORE JUST TO NOT FLY WITH SCOOT,1,"My opinion in general is that it is the WORST company in which I have traveled. I had in 2019 a 3-hour flight and then another 12-hour flight with Scoot. On the website it says that it includes a large suitcase (in general) and then that in economic it includes two handbags (I think I remember well). In addition it puts several options of weight: 1 without weight, 2 20 kg (don't remember €), 3 25 kg (don't remember €), etc. Which let me to think that if I carried 15 kg of checked luggage I didn't have to pay, and in fact, I had finally to pay € 100, what an amount of money!! I think they are RATS that badly explains things on the website to lead to DECEIT/SCAM. This comment may not show what I try to explain, but if you see it on the website it will be understood.
In addition, paying food were shown on the website, and I also thought it would be an extra, because of course, paying your 12h flight ticket, how could it be so incredibly RATS of not giving you a minimum of food and drink? I don't think I need to write that a miserable bottle of water 2 €. The truth is that I have nothing to claim because I'm sure they have it more than studied, but this comment that I will put in all the pages that I can, then people will see how disgusting they are, based on the bad explanation of their website to get more money in one way or another. And I say more, if we put 2 real minutes to read comments about this company, you will know I am not exaggerated.
Conclusion: PAY FOR A FLIGHT THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE WITH ANOTHER COMPANY and you will not have economic or food problems, or any problem in general, it worths. Actually, its possible to be CHEAPER than with Scoot."
Scoot,Good God if I could give them no stars…,1,"Good God if I could give them no stars I would. Cancelled my first flight despite knowing I needed to catch a connecting flight and didnt even give me the courtesy of notification.
Rang their pathetic excuse of a call centre 3 times, each time promising a resolution which does not eventuate. No assistance with rebooking nor escalation or recognition of how difficult it is to rebook another flight. No email address and their Facebook messenger is a chatbot. I am extremely sorry I was forced (thanks to the pandemic) to book with them. Horrific first (and only) time with Scoot."
Scoot,Exploited and bullied,1,"I am writing this with a rather bitter taste in the mouth after a backhander from Scoot airlines especially after having been a loyal customer for so long.

In the present difficult situation facing many travelers who are holding tickets booked prior to the pandemic you would have expected Scoot to show more understanding and compassion, but instead they are showing their true colors of being nothing but greedy, exploitative corporate bullies.

My experience: I had a flight booked for October 2020 which had to be changed because of current travel restrictions. Now according to the terms of carriage, I could change to any date in the next 12 month period (ie., up to October 2021).

Being prudent and pessimistic about the timing of the vaccine becoming available, I decided to delay flying as long as I possibly could...ie., changing to a date in October 2021. Imagine my shock and horror when the airline did not allow any booking beyond March 2021!

Since they were clearly in breach of the terms of carriage by not allowing me to choose the preferred flight dates, I asked for either a refund or a even credit. You guessed it...they not only flatly refused the request and but also insisted that I book the change for March 2021 or forfeit whatever fare I had already paid.

I had no option but to change my flight dates to March 2021 (in the process topping up an extra $300+), and just to rub salt into the wound, if the travel restrictions still remained in place in March 2021 I was told that I would have to pay extra to make further changes.

This is quite obviously a case of an airline which cared only for its bottom-lines...no thought at all about customers who are also caught in this difficult situation. What they have done is unfair and unethical because it clearly breaches the airline's terms of carriage and unfairly restricted the customer preferences. They make sure they protect their own interest even at the expense of customers.

I would like others who have had similar treatment by such unfair and shonky policies to share their experience and publicly shame this cheap-skate airline which care only for itself."
Scoot,Lousy company,1,"I promise myself i will not take scoot airlines again. It only keep giving us refund voucher and if the voucher is about to expiry but still can't go for the holiday trip then they only extend the voucher instead of giving me my cash back.

Called the operator and she say out of goodwill to give me the travel voucher previously due to my mother medical condition but come on think about it if i never told them my mother medical condition as now is still covid 19 period how an normal person willing to go for an oversea trip.

This kind of company doing business this way not the right way....

I will never book scoot again......"

Scoot,A very rigid airline with refunds. Not good enough SCOOT!! Show some compassion!!,2,"PRINCESS cancelled my perth to Singapore cruise for 22 February 2020 due to corona virus cases in Singapore. They gave me a full refund and extra cruise credit. Now that is good CUSTOMER SERVICE.
Now as for SCOOT............I had to cancel our Scoot flights from Singapore to Perth 8 March 2020 as our cruise to Singapore was cancelled so could not get there and also not safe. This was out of our control.
I requested a refund which under the circumstances you would think to be fair but after several attempts I was only given a credit to 31 march 21. In Western Australia we still might not even be able to travel and due to our age (Seniors) would not risk it anyway. The credit is a waste for us and this is money that would help us now, not like a useless credit!!
I am angry and more than disappointed in SCOOT that they can't show compassion and some common sense in regard to these circumstances. I did not want to cancel our flights, but were we supposed to buy a flight to Singapore just so we could use our 8th March flight to come back to Perth again.
SCOOT you need to rethink your customer service and look after your customers like PRINCESS Cruises did for us. We will go back to PRINCESS..........BUT SCOOT I WOULD SAY NOT unless there is some goodwill shown to two Seniors who did not want to cancel, but had no choice under these unusual circumstances.

Scoot,"Great airlines, will definitely fly with Scoot again",5,"Scoot has been relatively proactive in resolving customers' issues amidst the Covid19 pandemic. They were quick to issue a 'refund' mechanism on their website - saving the trouble of having to get through to the customer service hotlines. Subsequently, they even revised their policy to issue 1. 100%refund via original mode of payment; or 2. 120% refund in credit vouchers. This gesture is really appreciated, especially in these difficult times (for both the airlines and the customers). I would certainly choose to fly with Scoot again."
Scoot,Ryanair is Better,1,"This airline is not a low cost Airline, this is a rude and greedy one. You can not bring any food on this airline, and the costs for the food onboard costs about a 3rd of your ticket!($50USD) Staff is rude, do not fly with this Airline"
Scoot,Not a great experience in truth,2,"Not a great experience in truth, flight got in late meaning I missed my connection - literally 0 support from the airline in anyway.
Really frustrating experience overall and really hindered my ability to enjoy my trip as I had the financial problems of having to pay for additional flights looming over me."
Scoot,Full refund in 3 weeks!,4,"Booked ticket in end of January for travel in May. Got it cancelled in April due to coronavirus. I got an email where I could chose to receive 120% value in Scoot voucher or 100% full refund to original method of payment.
I chose 100% refund. Received another email where it was stated that a refund could take up to 15 weeks... Was not hopeful when I read that, as all the emails I've sent has still not been answered since March.
But I received the full refund 3 weeks after cancellation, and another automatic email saying that they had processed the refund."
Scoot,Fantastic customer service from Scoot!,5,"One of the best customer services I have ever received from an airline. Originally receiving 100% refund via Scoot vouchers, I then had another email stating that I could either receive 120% refund via Scoot vouchers or a 100% refund via my mode of payment. Great for them to change their policy considering these tricky times for everyone caused by Covid-19."
Scoot,Poor feedback and slow refund,1,"COVID-19 flight.

PNR: Z8S29J

£158 owed Refund requested, ""up to 14 weeks"" (plus 3 weeks since cancelled flight)."
Scoot,No refund for flight that was cancelled…,1,No refund for flight that was cancelled by the Airline itself. No alternate connection provided. No contact with the airline etc. THE WORST.
Scoot,AVOID AT ALL COST,1,"If I could give you a 0 I would. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic my flight was cancelled from Phuket to Bali was cancelled I cut my holiday short and went back to the UK and this is where my difficulty began. Despite emailing Scoot multiple times they were no help so ever. The one time I did get a response after asking for a refund to my card, they instead authorised a voucher I did not ask for nor need, I’ve now emailed them multiple times saying I have no need for a voucher and yet I’ve received no response even after 10 days. £230 isn’t something that can be overlooked. It’s a lot to loose in a voucher you can never use nor asked for!!!!!"
Scoot,departure flight- cancellation- refund voucher issue!,1,"So my initial departure flight was cancelled, due to the Corina virus. And that that airline had decreed that they were restricting flights and certain passengers. So with that in mind, needing only to get another flight to meet my connections I booked with Scoot. Paid £80 and got the confirmation email. Relief. But that was short lived. Only for 24 hours as they had cancelled the flight out from Bali to Singapore. The response I got was simple. Thanks for your money, you can have a refund, but in the form of a voucher of which has a validity of 12 months. NO. This virus isn’t going anywhere, and I can’t see myself returning within that time frame. So I want my refund in the form of Currency. Not some voucher.

I contacted them by social media, and have had no response. I could return home and end up in either self isolation or quarantine and maybe fall ill to the point of no return.

The company should in this instance refund in currency due to these very special circumstances.

I would avoid using this site, because although I’ve tried to contact, they play good at being deaf.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS. However if they do come back to me with a solution if a full currency Refund then I will alter my stance on this situation."
Scoot,Worst experience with scoot airlines,1,"we have booked a ticket for Vietnam in scoot on 13/03/2020. But due to Corona outbreak the Vietnam government strictly announced all the hotels to stop the tourists so they cancelled our hotel bookings and refunded the amount fully. In the meanwhile we spoke with the Vietnam embassy too and they advised us not to travel and risk our life. So we cancelled all the bookings like cruise,hotels and flight tickets since it spreads more during the travel and in the transit. Everyone understands the situation and refunded our money except the scoot airways..
We booked the return ticket in indigo as a non refundable ticket but They agreed to cancel it with the full refund by considering the situation and initiated the refund.

But in scoot We raised request many times through mail and customer care with proper document which is related to our vietnam itinerary (with all the cancelled tickets and refunds)
Till now we didn't get any response, we called Indigo and spent only 10 minutes for the refund and they initiated the refund immediately . we are spending time more than 72 hours with you but we didn't get any mails regarding the refund

Every flight carriers are taking care of their customers except scoot.


I'm really disappointed with the scoot's service. It took a month to earn that money but you simply ignored our request. Please try to understand the customers pain point.

It's not just a money it is our hard earnings. This kind of service from you breaks the trust and the customer relationship.

Try to show some respect to your customers and please do respond to them when they are in Need."
Scoot,Hold time when calling is disappointing 😕,3,"I’ve called Scoot 6 times now to reschedule my flights due to Coronavirus and all 6 times I’ve been on hold on the phone for 1+ hours and hung up each time. It’s ridiculous, tried emailing and they called me back only to hang up on me. I do like this airline and think they’re great value for money however I’m sorry to say their customer service is one of the worst I’ve ever had to deal with and am still dealing with."
Scoot,If I could give a zero,1,"If I could give a zero, I would.
I am a wheelchair user and recently flew from Sydney to Singapore return and paid for ‘Plus’ services with my hubby.

I don’t think they have ever had any training or policies in regards to mobility customers. Check in was a disaster, arrival was a disaster both on the flight over & back with absolutely no assistance or care given. Had to wait so long for transfer chair I didn’t have time to use the bathroom before the flight home. (And then the chair was broken & extremely uncomfortable). Even tho we were at the check in at allotted time. I am so glad I was not traveling on my own.

Shame on you Scoot."
Scoot,Racist and incompetent employees,1,"This is the second time I've encountered the racist check in employees of scoot airlines. I arrived at Jakarta airport at 6pm to check in for my 8pm (local time) flight to Singapore. Just so we are clear,
I am proudly black and hold an Irish passport.

While I was on the queue I noticed one of the men behind the counter staring at me and didn't think anything of it. As soon as it was my turn to check in the Gentleman who said his name was Mr Surya Alief demanded to see my visa to Singapore or an onward ticket

I was shocked and told him I had no onward ticket and as an Irish citizen I had 30 days entry into Singapore, I have no intention of staying for 30days. I just left Singapore on 25th February I went there on a one way ticket

He refused to check me in and told me he has checked my passport there is no visa to Singapore. i asked him to check on my visa statues as an eu✓ Irish citizen, the attached photo are the 3 Scoot employees who were incapable of checking online for my visa requirements.

Usually once a passport is swiped, their system should indicate if I require a visa to Singapore.

I showed him the last entry stamp into Singapore on 25th February. I went there with a one way ticket and onward to Malaysia, then to Indonesia still on one way tickets simply because I didn't know how long I would need in each country/ city

They delayed me until 5mins to the gate closing I called scoot call centre and was on hold for 1hr39mins finally got through to the Philippines. I would have preferred to speak to someone in Singapore as it might have been easier to clarify my visa requirements from immigration

The racist guy actually sent and email to the call centre that he would not let me board the flight. Ms Eugene in the Philippines told me the decision lies with the check-in counter in Jakarta. They are happy to book me on another flight for another day, and not tomorrow 9th And no hotel.

Finally I decided to see how smart he was, I booked a flight on Singapore airlines app departing at 9am from Singapore.
Which was confirmed. I showed it to him, he insisted on seeing the confirmation. He checked me in, I walked away and cancelled the booking.

Scoot, this is the second incident in less than a year. Update your system, train your employees, inform them of visa regulations for individual countries. it's not determined by my skin colour!
This has been posted on flyscoot FB page, no comment from them yet."
Scoot,SCOOT WEIGHED MY 3 LAPTOPS.,1,"SCOOT WEIGHED MY 3 LAPTOPS.
I was having flight with Scoot from Jakarta to Singapore last January 2020. Unfortunately, the flight ticketing at check-in counter tore my boarding pass. She tore my boarding pass in front of me, and i cannot get on board because of that... I told her that i bring backpack and laptops. i had 3 laptops on my hand (only 3 naked laptop Without bags, without covers), and 1 backpack. the backpack is 7 kg. And she counted my 3 laptops to be weighed too...really ?? It's over weight due to my 3 laptops. So i have to call my parents to take back my backpack to bring back home. I NEVER WILL USE SCOOT ANYMORE.."
Scoot,Will not give any stars if this is available. Extremely poor customer service.,1,"I tried booking for very first flight with Scoot, and have not had a satisfactory experience thus far. Firstly, I was overcharged by $300 (the exact same return flight when I checked the following day was $300 lesser in total cost!). Secondly, I was sent an email that my flights have been rescheduled due to ""operational reasons"" and in that email, it was indicated that I could reschedule my flight.
Third, since attempting to reschedule my flight for the last 1 week, I've been having issues with being charged an additional seat selection fee (which I had already paid for in my original booking), which meant that I haven't been bale to proceed to confirm my booking.
Fourth, when I try to contact customer service about the issues above, I receive generic responses that have NOT in any way addressed the issue of my not being able to proceed to confirm my booking due to the additional fee imposed, even though the email has clearly stated ""no additional cost"" for rebooking.
Right now, I am still waiting to get some form of concrete action from Scoot about my rescheduling, which is already at a great inconvenience to me, as Scoot has NOT even offered to pay for all of the other rebookings (airport transfers, parking rebooking, etc) that I've had to pay for to reschedule due to the flight schedule changes.
For a budget airline that purports to pride itself in its service to the standard of a full-paying airline, and which charges the same in the end, one would expect a lot more from them. Go full commercial if you can and avoid this airline that clearly does not care.
P.S. I have also provided my booking number in my attempts at contact, however, the responses thus far clearly suggest that the customer service persons have had no interest in actually checking on my booking."
Scoot,Worst airline ever,1,"I came here to write a bad review and I was not surprised to see a million other 1-star reviews. Customer support DOES NOT EXIST. I'm currently waiting on the line, and so far it's been 1 hour and 26 minutes. Not the greatest experience. They have CANCELLED MY FLIGHTS but REFUSE TO REFUND. Do not book with this airline, do yourself a favor and spend €50 more with another airline that will support you should anything happen (on their side...)."
Scoot,Beware of this f***** up airline,1,"Beware of this f***** up airline!
The flight was simply postponed for a week. A refund of the money is not possible. Contact is catastrophic. Never again!!!"
Scoot,There is no support at all,1,"When everything goes smoothly, you get what you expect with Scoot: a flight and not much else.

Should you need to contact support.... forget it. They don't reply to messages on Facebook or Twitter (their recommended support channels) and I gave up on the phone support before the call costs for being on hold got out of hand."
Scoot,Terrible experience ....,1,"Arrogant , lazy , unfriendly , impolite !
It was my first time to fly with scoot airline , never ever fly with them again!
They treated their passengers like an animal."
Scoot,"IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BOOKING WITH THEM, DON'T DO IT",1,"Booked a flight with them. A week later, the Wuhan Virus became scary. Website said can change dates without paying the rebooking fee, if I call their hotline or reach out to their Facebook page. Called a few times, all of which I was put in hold for more than half an hour, and no one answered. Facebook option didn't helped at all. Even sent an email and nobody replied back. So with no hope, I rebooked through the app and paid the said rebooking fee.

4 days before my supposed flight, I received an email that I can now use the app to rebook free of charge, so I tried calling them to see if the fee can be reversed. Called them again a few times, nobody answered yet again. Felt like the whole thing was a scam. I'm not expecting the fee to be reversed tbh, I just wanted to hear all details from them and send a feedback to them, but now they got me really mad for giving me the WORST customer service of my life.

My advice- DON'T EVER FLY WITH THEM."
Scoot,Seriously don't book with Scoot,1,"Seriously - avoid Scoot
They changed my flight departure time (Perth - Singapore) by nearly 4 hours. Originally scheduled to arrive at 11.30pm, new arrival time 3.15am next day.
The new unearthly arrival time was completely unsuitable so I contacted Scoot CS via phone No changes allowed, no refunds allowed.
I then contacted their customer care team via email. No changes allowed, no refunds allowed, no vouchers, no sympathy, please check our T's & C's and you'll see that we've got you by the balls.
Its rare these days to come across such a bad customer service experience as I did with Scoot."
Scoot,WORST EXPERIENCES EVER!!!,1,"WORST EXPERIENCES EVER!!!
Even Ryanair have better services!!!

13 hours long flight
- no water (you can buy 0,3l for nice 2SGD - more less 2USD)
- no food
- no pillow or blanket
- no entertaiment system
- wifi didn't work
- no notice about delay (70min) or time of landing

Special story is cabin crew.
They DIDN'T speak English, for any question they just repeated few sentence from book.
Also they spend most of the time hidden in back part of aircraft to prevent service or chance to buy at least bottle of water.

NEVER AGAIN!!! it's not worth it save of the money.

PS: even Ryanair is better."
Scoot,Until recently I used to fly by Silk…,1,"Until recently I used to fly by Silk air from Coimbatore. Now it is replaced by a flight called scoot. Flew into Coimbatore on 18th jan. Airline name is apt - Horrible experience. Never expected this quality from SIA. Leg space absolutely nil, badly maintained aircraft, worst toilets, disastrous food not worth consuming ( I came from SFO to Singapore and from there took Scoot ). You will loose patronage if this flight is continued. You have taken Coimbatore passengers for granted."
Scoot,Worst low cost.,1,"Worst low cost.

Cancelled a flight due to ""volcanic activity"" days after said activity and while all other airlines were flying. Had to book with another full-service carrier. Refund takes 6-8 weeks to process and in voucher format and not available combined with other promotions. Therefore, money lost with the last-minute booking with another airline, with having to wait to get a refund, and the worst part is being tied to yet another Scoot flight. I just want my money back.

Flight on the way back also had an issue. It was rescheduled to an hour earlier and I almost missed it. No consideration for passenger's schedules.

Overall, AVOID IT."
Scoot,Do not fly Scoot unless you are…,1,"Do not fly Scoot unless you are depressed and have no other choice on this planet. This airlines is like a fish market and treat people like cattle. Charged me extra $300 for something that can be taken as a carry on which I did carry on 5 flights before this and made me pay money. That is not the only issue, but you have to pay for water and everything and the flight staff must be from a country where they work for food. Bad airlines and do not travel on it."
Scoot,It is inhuman to offer 250ml of water…,2,"It is inhuman to offer 250ml of water for 11 hours flight..Ok i can understand that is a low cost airline, but for this long voyages they must reconsider"
Scoot,Decent airline for Budget,4,"Frequent flyer of this budget airlines (abt 2-3 times a year). I think reasonable. Food was decent. Interface is easy to use when you want to upgrade seats.

Seats are similar to other budget airlines seats. Cramp, but bearable if your journey is not very long.

All in all decent airline for its class - Budget."
Scoot,"Threats, extortion, rude and cruel staff",1,"Scoot is the worst airline I have had the misfortune to fly. I would not wish this vile airline even on its own awful staff.

Staff lack basic human decency - when I tried to cancel a flight because of a death in the family, this was the Scoot call centre staff’s response in full: “your mother died? Send us the death certificate and proof of relationship”. Complete lack of empathy and compassion.

Threats and extortion - another time, their useless website failed repeatedly to let me select seat or check in online. Still Scoot airport staff (an appalling rude and dishonest duty officer Jatinder Kal Singh at Amritsar airport) extorted the fee by threatening to deny boarding. This in a city where I had nowhere to go and a country where a woman is raped every 15 min - this airline is a danger to passengers.

Lying and covering up - their “guest experience” / customer support staff exist basically to deny all misbehaviour by Scoot, pretend that the airline can do no wrong, and blame customers.

Truly horrific company. Avoid at all costs."
Scoot,Im going to make this straight forward,1,"Im going to make this straight forward; Scoot offers a very convenient flight for us being Perth - Amritsar (something other flights dont do).
However the online website is shocking at best. We tried to 'pre-pone' our trip so we can leave earlier. But it was an horrible experience, logins didnt work, website kept on running into errors and it is definitely not user-friendly!"
Scoot,Totally agree with the very bad ratings…,1,"Totally agree with the very bad ratings here! Lost our baggage and never responded! Worst/Non existent costumer service. Dont book them, pay extra and fly with a serious company as if something bad happens you will be left all alone!"
Scoot,We lost a baggage on a flight from…,1,We lost a baggage on a flight from Singapore to Sydney. We wrote in to scoot and they never responded! Think twice before choosing this airlines! Bad is not enough to describe them.
Scoot,Poor treatment by staff of family travelling with child,1,"My husband, 2 year old daughter and I recently travelled on your Scoot flight TR540 recently from Singapore to Coimbatore. It was a connecting flight with a previous flight from Sydney to Singapore via Singapore Airlines. Our daughter was 2 years 2 months old and had a separate seat on the flight. She was fast asleep on the flight and during the preparation for landing, she wanted to stay on my lap. We asked for an infant seat belt, as we used the same on the previous Singapore Airlines flight and she was fine on that flight. When we made the same request to Scoot, we were told that it was against company policy and that she had to be seated. Despite many attempts, my daughter was still very sleepy and did not want to be separated from me. The staff on board were completely unsympathetic to the situation and kept insisting on enforcing the rules, despite there being another option (the infant seatbelt) which met the safety standard, and would also allow my daughter to be settled on the flight. My daughter was crying to the point of being traumatised. The staff members, particularly the hostess in charge, treated us horribly despite pleas from us and all our surrounding passengers, who knew the challenges of travelling with children. We left the flight very disappointed with the way the staff had been trained to handle such a situation, when Scoot’s parents airline has a sensible way to handling this same situation.

The staff’s behaviour was poor because:

a) they took a decision to keep the airline circling because the child would not sit separately and did not show any flexibility around the infant seat belt
b) threatened us that she would have the flight land elsewhere if we could not manage our child. How they still planned to land and manage the same situation was unclear, so not a sensible strategy
c) made a poor announcement on the flight that a passenger was not cooperating hence delaying the flight, but failed to say that it was a 2 year old child

In the end, they saw that she had her seatbelt fastened for a minute, and then disappeared because their rule and policy had been satisfied and they got a tick in the box.

We are in an unfortunate situation where we have to travel via Scoot on our return journey.

We have these requests from your airline:

1) take some corrective action against the staff members above so that they are clear their behaviour was very poor. This was noticed by all surrounding passengers who were equally enraged
2) review your policy in such situations by offering an infant seat belts, particularly where the child is still quite young, and not old enough to understand the situation

This will help out other parents as this appalling behaviour is unacceptable for any airline."
Scoot,Amateur company,2,"Both Scoot airlines and Opodo failed to let me know that my flight was not going to happen and that I was due a flight later that day. This was worse because I was in Macao early morning (6.00) and wasn't allowed to take the ferry to HK airport (which was previously booked and payed for) because they could not find the flight on the system. Had to return to the hotel, look in the internet for costumer service and was about to book a different flight for same day because did not know what were my rights/couldn't be bothered to go through CS hassle. Finally, I was able to contact airline (had to ask for a chinese phone so would not pay the call) and was informed about an alternative flight (with a different flight number) at 11 PM. Stealing 1 holy day like that as we arrived at Singapore at 2 AM.

The rest was typical low-budget company, plane ok, seat comfort just ok, staff was friendly but not even a glass of water in 4h flight (and also not allowed to bring your own food in??)."
Scoot,worst and worst and the almighty worst from every worst?,1,"the delay made me sleep at the airport and lose my pick up transportation and one-day trip
worst and worst and the almighty worst from every worst?"
Scoot,Singapore - Macau was great,5,"I booked with them to go from Singapore to Macau and back.
No complaints at all, I had a normal flight... just a small delay of 20 min or so from Macau to Singapore it was the flight around 10:00 AM.

When I booked my flight and had to pay... i had to redo this step 3 times until I could finally pay lol

But otherwise no problems!"
Scoot,Show some consideration for your passengers!,2,"Having plenty of time on my hands stuck at a third rate airport in Thailand...yes, courtesy of another Scoot flight delay I'm passing time reading all these negative reviews and I wonder if Scoot actually pays any attention to them. Granted that flight delays are often happenstance that doesn't spare even the best airlines in the world, I think it is the customer service attitude that makes all the difference between a good airline and one that sucks. In my case, I had received notification at 0530 hours that my flight had been rescheduled from 1700 to 1925 for ""operational reasons"". Ok...not good but at least they told me. So I dutifully make my way to the airport at 1630 only to be told at check in that the new ""estimated"" departure time was now 2235. So, Scootie, what's so difficult about keeping passengers updated in a timely way rather than having them turn up at the airport only to be informed by ground staff ...who by the way claim they have also been kept in the dark until the very last minute. You know what sucks more...the delay (1700 - 2235) was over dinner period...you'd expect that out of a bit of decency or concern, the least Scoot could have done was to offer some sustenance, some token snack and water. You guessed it...nothing at all. Such meanness. I guess they probably view budget class passengers as trash...not deserving to be treated with dignity or concern. What budget class mentality, Scootie!!! No wonder you're attracting such poor reviews."
Scoot,Lost bag and no update at all,1,"Lost bag, no one contactable for 5 days already to give any update.

Booked Scoot, it's not cheap! SGD1,200 from Manila to Athens in total including luggage, excluding food! One bag got lost on trip from Athens to Manila, reported, sent emails and no updates at all (tracking# MNLTR10800).

For the same price and with much better customer service, could have booked Emirates. But we booked Scoot knowing that it's a sister airline of Singapore Airlines so we thought the level of service will be at par. Will never book Scoot again!"
Scoot,Terrible airlines,1,"They rescheduled my sister's flight to Xi'an China by more than 2 hours later which means she'll arrive 1220am midnight on her own! Asked to release her from the booking and provide a full refund so she could fly with another airlines who can get her there at 10pm, at a time where the rest of the family will be there to meet her. Their customer service said no. Absolute no apathy. It should be made illegal for them to do this as people book the flight to get to the destination at a certain time. Never choose to with them again."
Scoot,THE WORST AIRLINE,1,"My opinion in general is that it is the WORST company in which I have traveled. I had a 3-hour flight and then another 12-hour flight with Scoot. On the website it says that it includes a large suitcase (in general) and then that in economic it includes two handbags (I think I remember well). In addition it puts several options of weight: 1 without weight, 2 20 kg (don't remember €), 3 25 kg (don't remember €), etc. Which let me to think that if I carried 15 kg of checked luggage I didn't have to pay, and in fact, I had finally to pay € 100, what an amount of money!! I think they are SEWER RATS that badly explains things on the website to lead to DECEIT/SCAM. This comment may not show what I try to explain, but if you see it on the website it will be understood.
In addition, paying food were shown on the website, and I also thought it would be an extra, because of course, paying your 12h flight ticket, how could it be so incredibly RATS of not giving you a minimum of food and drink? I don't think I need to write that a miserable bottle of water 2 €. SOAB. The truth is that I have nothing to claim because I'm sure they have it more than studied, but this comment that I will put in all the pages that I can, then people will see how disgusting they are, based on the bad explanation of their website to get more money in one way or another. And I say more, if we put 2 real minutes to read comments about this company, you will know I am not exaggerated.
Conclusion: PAY FOR A FLIGHT THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE WITH ANOTHER COMPANY and you will not have economic or food problems, or any problem in general, it worths. Actually, its possible to be CHEAPER than with Scoot."
Scoot,Low-cost airline,1,"Low-cost airline, but unreliable one. I booked and paid for my all luggages (45kg). Then, when I checked in, the system didn't how my payment for the luggages. I only could send 25kg, the rest I had to handle by myself and keep in Germany and deliver by other means. There was no one from Scoot airlines in Tegel airport, the check-in staffs were from the airport - not from the airline, so they said they couldn't handle that. I showed all documents to them, but they still didn't accept because the system didn't show. I tried bunch of times to call and contact someone from Scoot, but the phone calls were failed (they showed on the website that they serve 24/7, I called at 7am to 7h30 am, I just had only 2 hours before my departure, no one picked the phone). Scoot was so bad in customer service. The first time with Scoot is the last time, in my case. Now, one of my luggage is still in Germany and I have to pay again for other delivery, so terrible."
Scoot,Quoted price in Singapore Dollars but charged in Euros!,5,"I just booked a flight for my husband and I Athens to Singapore. The currency was listed in Singapore Dollars. I tried to change the currency to Euros or even Canadian Dollars so that I could understand the amount. As this wasn’t possible I used a currency converter to get an understanding of how much 1000 Singaporean Dollars was.
Ok, I can afford this. Booking confirmation goes through and a window pops up saying my booking reference and a price of 1000 EUROS not Singapore Dollars!!??!!
So I think I’m paying in Singapore Dollars but it’s actually Euros. There was not one point during booking that the price was listed in euros. Always listed in Singapore Dollars. Every add on: Singapore Dollars!!!
What is this? An error or a scam?
I want a full refund unless they plan to honour the quoted price in Singapore Dollars. The price I’ve paid is more than double what I expected based on what they quoted.
I’ve called and emailed them. After reading these reviews I am not very hopeful that they will do anything about it. Robbery!!

Update: Scoot responded after 24 hrs via phone call to state they were going to rectify the error by giving us a refund for the difference between Euro and Singapore Dollars. They are honouring the advertised price! Well done Scoot. We hoped for a full refund at best but this is even better. Thank you."
Scoot,Scoot is the reason budget airlines get the rap that they do...,1,"I have been following up on a complaint I raised with them for three months!!! Complaint No 19051437249 still remains unresolved. Every time I call back to follow up, they either say someone will call back with a resolution or simply disconnect half way through the conversation knowing they haven't managed to resolve even after three months. Highly incompetent staff, in flight crew is no better. On time departure and arrivals are a rare commodity for them and their behaviour and attitude is appalling. Scoot is the worst of the worst of budget airlines and is the reason people have the impression of budget airlines that they do."
Scoot,Scoot airlines is terrible,1,"after reading a few of the poor reviews our problem has already been multiplied several times previous. I wish I'd read a little further into reviews before booking Perth to Athens on Scoot airlines. They canceled our existing flight and keep hanging up on us when we go to change the date. It's shocking to think a company like this can exist in a competitive market. Avoid at all cost, pay the extra whatever the price is to not be disappointed with connections and additional costs that come with a reschedule of fights. Maybe the worst customer service with an airline I've experienced in 30 plus years of flying."
Scoot,Terrible customer service!,1,"Booked the standard economy flight and added a meal since it was an 8 hour flight and we didn't want to starve (in the Scott T's and C's they prohibit you bringing your own food on board).
We were offered the opportunity to pay to upgrade to business class which we decided to do and treat ourselves. The business class flight comes with a meal so when we spoke with the girl at check in we were told that if we just phone the scoot helpline they will be able to process a refund.
We duly phoned the helpline but were told that Scoot would neither offer us a refund for the first meal or provide the two meals that we had in effect paid for."
Scoot,I haven't even flown with them yet and…,1,"I haven't even flown with them yet and my experience has been so bad that I will never book with them again. I booked my family's flight 2 months ago and some time between then and yesterday they changed our flights to be 24 hours later, without so much as an email to let us know. In the ""manage my booking"" tab, I was offered the opportunity to change my flights for free, as our flights had been moved by the airline. I tried to move my flights back to the date that I had originally booked them and was offered 4 flight options (one of which was a reasonable option), however when I tried to click in to that flight, it said it was sold out (as did all of the options that were offered). I then rang the Sydney number for the call centre, and you can guess the outcome of that, when I requested what seems like a reasonable outcome (to book one of the flights that was offered to me). Turns out that the 4 flights offered were not sold out, but that one of the legs offered is a Singapore Airlines flight, so they won't let me book it as it's a different airline (if this were Qantas/Jetstar, it would have been offered as a codeshare, but not with this Singapore Airlines subsidiary, despite the offer being in writing). Given everyone else's experience, it looks like I will need to accept that there is absolutely no recourse other than to accept that my family all now need to take an extra day off work and book an extra night of accommodation in Krabi, and hope to God they don't decide to change our flights again. The only option that the call centre offered was a refund, but 2 months out from the flight, it is 2 - 3 times the price of our original booking, if we tried to book new tickets (plus, who knows if the refund would even happen, given everyone else's experiences). Never again, Scoot!"

07 Jul 2019    12:25PM  on the 7 july on a scoot flight singapore to cebu the last hour of the flight my family was asked to move away from the exit seats in which i asked why when there was so many vacant seats on the plane available, we didnt know their seating policy regarding upgrade to seat on some seats near middle exit, we actually asked why. The flight attendant spoke to us rudely about the said policy, we understood so we moved back to our original seats. We thought after we moved it's all good, but the flight attendant continues to provoke us instead of leaving us alone. The attendant need re training, on managing conflicts instead of creating one so she can use her power to threaten passengers they will be reported etc. This flight attendant working performance is poor and it need to be reviewed. As i said, we told her to go away and leave us alone but she still continues to harass us, no one should be treated that regardless of what airline 'Scoot we will never fly with you again because of that flight attendant. To everyone, please take note on our review or you may have the same fate we had Scoot."
Scoot,Lies and fraud. The worst customer service too.,1,"Awful awful customer service.
After being told by a customer service agent that checked baggage was $1/kg, we tried to book and the minimum was $100 for 20kg.

After multiple attempts to rectify with the airline, they failed to call when they said they would and we spent more than 2 hours over 4 days trying to get the problem ""reviewed"".

They told lies and nothing was done. Did backflips and their story and nothing helpful was ever mentioned.
Scoot Never ever ever ever again.
Complete fraudsters. Even by budget airline standards."
Scoot,Very poor customer service,1,"Before you book with Scoot I'll share my recent experience. On 27th April I flew overnight from Singapore to the Gold Coast. I paid for and sat in an exit row. As such there was no seat in front and no seat back pocket to put my small bag of personal belongings. The person sitting in the window seat had a pocket on the wall next to them. But myself and the person next to me had none. There was however two of these pockets on the wall opposite right next to where the flight attendant sits for takeoff and landings. I assumed these two pockets was for myself and the passenger next to me. So I put my bag of belongings in one and went to sleep. Several hours later I woke up and my bag was gone. I asked the flight attendant where it went and she said she threw it out. When I asked why she answered very rudely and aggressively """"well why did you put it there"". After I recovered from my shock I explained why. She then stormed off. And returned sometime later with my bag which she'd obviously fished out of the bin. As she dropped it in my lap she told me ''oh btw it's wet''. Sure enough I'm now sitting there with a wet plastic bag in my lap. No apology, didn't even dry it off before giving it to me. If that wasn't bad enough when I got home I discovered my MP3 player that was inside would not turn on. It's dead. So I logged a complaint detailing the above and received an auto reply email advising ""it may take up to 10 working days to respond''. Fair enough except that they didn't. I let it go for another two weeks and still nothing so I emailed again. Received another meaningless reply. Another two weeks I tried again and nothing. So I tried to message via FB messenger instead. I got a reply and they asked for more info then ignored me. I then rang the Scoot office in Sydney and they were no help either. They said they would email head office. So here we are 7 weeks after the incident on the flight. My MP3 player is still dead, no one from Scoot has contacted me. So if you want to get treated this way and ignored then sure go ahead and fly Scoot. I know I will never fly with them again."
Scoot,To Scoot or not to Scoot,1,"In just one single trip I have come to the following conclusion about Scoot

- Scoot staff dont care about peoples property
- Scoots rules about seat luggage allowance is inconsistent and in our case they seem to deliberately swindled us
- Scoots Customer Service does not necessarily respond to communication and when they do always seems to be after the 10 days probably to wear people down and in my case here, they directed me to their own conditions pdf ... which in fact contradicted themselves
- Scoot seems to look down on people with some ethnic background
- .... more conclusions drawn after below story, which is a bit long for a trip that should have been completely eventful

All in all, I dont really know how they are allowed to run a business. Used car sales men are more honest than Scoot. Anyway, here is my story.

...

Us: my wife, my son, 18 months ... he is very big for his age and then me.

The travel: my wife and son goes to Thailand from Gold Coast Australia first and I will meet them later. Since my son is quite big it would be a pretty horrible experience to sit with him on the lap, so we decided to spoil him and in particular us with his own seat.

It's not possible to book a separate seat for your kid under two years on the Scoot portal. So I called Scoot and was told that I needed to go book a ticket for my wife with lap infant first and then call them to buy the seat next to. Ok ... it started to get a bit risky ... what if I couldn't get the seat. Anyway, I did what I was told and called Scoot. When you call Scoot, they ask you for your phone number in case the line is cut. Great ... except that didn't happen after it was cut of the first time. I had booked 20A for my wife on the internet, the plane was virtually empty so what could go wrong .. Haha. After I had explained Scoot that I wanted 20B and the agent went off to book it, the line was dropped, and when I finally got through again to another sales person, the seat was taken!!! ... but of course ... by my son I assume, but the person in the other end was not allowed to tell me :-). Anyway ... my wife on 20A got moved to 19A and my son got 19B. I was also told that I could not buy the extra 20kg luggage for the seat on the phone, but had to do it at the counter in the airport. I knew that would be more expensive, but the service agent could not tell me how much. Off to a good start :-)

So ... at the airport in Gold Coast to send off my wife and son. They got all the papers at the counter as well as the passports. The price to the extra 20kg was horrendous ... I was not expecting it to be that much, but we needed to have it. Off to another desk to pay. And then the lady unknowingly dropped a hint, that it would be cheaper if belonged to a seat and then it struck me ... they hadn't registered my son on his seat, they had just checked him in as a lap infant on my wife even though they got all the papers right there ... that's why it was so bloody expensive. So ... I then informed the staff if this and then suddenly the price for the luggage dropped to $140 one way ... still quite a lot compared to the $105 return on the internet. Had I known, we would probably have reconsidered Scoot in the first place

My wife and son boarded and the air hostesses informed my wife that he was a lap infant and that he needed to stay on her lap. At some time throughout the flight he did get to sit on his seat, afterall none was sitting there ... right. But I'm writing this on our way back and I can see the confusion. You simply don't get any boarding pass that indicates that you own the extra seat you paid for and that might have caused the confusion with the Scoot staff. I wrote to Scoot saying that I found it fair that when they refused my son the seat we had paid for, then the should consider refunding some or all of it. The answer back was that ""during takeoff and landing the infant must sit on the lap"". I wrote back that that was not what it was about, we know that, but it got an auto reply back that the case had been closed. The motivation for me writing was mainly that I was somewhat angry. From what my wife told me, it didn't sound like they were particular polite or nice to her ... maybe because she is Thai, I dont know.

Well, she got there ... and so did I a couple of weeks later. We had a great time. And then it was time to go home. What a trip ...

At the checkin the extra suitcase suddenly cost 8kg x 1250 baht/kg which corresponds to around A$440 and it was handled as pure excess luggage. I tried explaining that in Gold Coast it was checked in as the 20kg seat luggage allowance for our extra seat, but the service agent had already called her superior and the verdict had been made. We had to pay ... I was getting a bit upset and must admit, I felt treated quite unfair, but was sure that Scoot could be reasoned with regarding this later when I would write to them so that at least we paid the same A$140 as when we flew out.

So that was it, now we were on our way home ..... NOT. We have this very smart collapsible stroller that becomes around 30x30x10 cm when collapsed. We always just bring it as hand luggage and it slides in between all the other things in the overhead compartment. But this time it was different. I stuck it in an overhead compartment, but an air hostess came and told me that it was a security risk and that she had to take and I gave it to her

It's strange though ... as I said, I'm sitting in a Scoot plane writing this and the stroller is in the overhead compartment now.

Anyway, we landed in Singapore and asked the air crew where our stroller was and they could not answer. We had to go to Counter E on the way to Arrival. We dashed ... around 2 hours is what we had. At Counter E I was asked for the luggage tag .... eeeehhhh. The lady that snapped the stroller out of my hand didn't give me a luggage tag ... so the Scoot guy couldn't help me get my $400 stroller back that the air crew took from me ... What to do. I figured it would probably end up at the luggage belt in Singapore ... but that would mean I had to go out and then in again very fast.

One hour later with a very sweaty tshirt and legs soaring I was back after a crazy dash .... I got it. Two minutes later at E4 and two minutes later they closed the gate. Time to change tshirt ... completely exhausted.

As I have said, we are now sitting on the plane. My son is sleeping, so is my wife, we are going home. I sure hope this is the last I will write. I mean, what can possible go wrong now ...

But I must admit that I feel cheated by Scoot. They do not have a system that is geared for booking extra seat with luggage for a toddler under 2. And this has now resulted in us paying a lot more than me for my baby boy that weighs far less than me. But thats really not the only thing thats wrong.

I am now completing the story here over a month after the journey. I have written to Scoot regarding the excess luggage and waited the 10 days without a reply from them. I had attached scans of reciepts. Then I wrote again and have waited another 10 days without hearning anything. But then I heard from Lyn Kho with the following message:

""Our record shows that you have purchased an extra seat for your infant, however, infants are not considered as a full paying passenger. You may refer to our Conditions of Carriage 3.3 regarding infant passenger."" and with a link to the pdf that Trustpilot does not allowed to paste to here.

Funny thing is that this document does not state what she says. In fact under baggage allowance it says ""Infants not occupying a seat have no Checked Baggage allowance"" which must mean that our son, since he occupied a seat either had a checked baggage allowance or at least was allowed to have one. So, they seem they will do anything to deflect. I have written to them with this argument. And they replied back that they have considered it and that infants occupying a seat still cannot have Checked Baggage allowance.

- There is inconsistency in the way they treat seat luggage allowance wise at different airports which cost us a lot
- The web portal crashed multiple times when I tried to book luggage ... in the crash dump it said that they had ""been informed"" ... right. Maybe if the portal had worked I could have paid $105 return for luggage for my son as well instead of the total of $540
- The air hostesses seems to look down on people, at least my wife who is kindness incarnated
- The air hostesses seemed to have no information on extra seats and who is entitled to use them.
- The air hostesses apparently just assumed that we were getting off in Singapore .... the way they handled the stroller part in the story border lines theft of $400 in my books. It was only that I broke a massive sweat to ""pull it from the dumpster"" that I got my property back.
- The people in service phone has no clue about prices of luggage, again it seems this case falls out of their flow chart.
- The customer support does not respond, responds consistently only after the 10 days probably to wear you down and will apparently try and make you give up by death by paragraphs ... but I can read and this has become a matter of principle for me.

In case there is a person with Scoot that bothers with customer satisfaction, our itinerary numbers are T37INL and OB7YFA. In case anyone disputes my story, I got lots of documentation and am happy to provide it. Except a stroller luggage tag ... but at least I didn't lose the stroller ??

I have kind of come to the conclusion so far that at least for us, Scoot is not worth the savings or the risk for that matter

Kind Regards
Franz Thomsen"
Scoot,Keep your eyes open...,3,"I flew with them from Gold Coast to Singapore, it was my first time and after all the review that I red, honestly I was bit scared.
The good part:
- I had a bit of overweight(3 kg) with my luggage, but the lady at the check-in counter was kind and closed an eye for me(don’t tell everybody). The journey to Singapore was like a good normal flight, on time as schedule.
The bad part:
- Up in the air with Scoot is like flying inside of a Hotel, NOTHING is for free, like nothing, forget about free snack( I bought my own food and drinks before my departure, even if the company doesn’t aloud to BYO FOOD, but who cares!), thanks god they didn’t ask me to pay for the oxygen, it won’t surprise me at all.

People nowadays complain about anything, you simply get what you pay for.
It can be a cheap airline as far you well organise yourself with the luggage weights and you don’t make mistake with passport details.
Hope I helped someone with my review😊"
Scoot,Don't Ever Fly Scoot!!!,1,"I wish I had read these reviews before I booked. You really do not want to use Scoot Airline!!!

Our tickets from CRK(Philippines) to SIN (Singapore) cost about $105US, but then to do basic things like select seats so that we can sit together and for one of us to get one 20kg checked bag... this added a cost of $45. So the price is now close to 50% more.

The carry-on baggage weight limit is 10kg (15lbs)... this is close to nothing... you certainly could not have much of a trip with that limit. For most anyone, you have no choice but to pay for checked bag(s).

Then the booking company (Trip.com) made errors when sending our names to the airline (put our ""first and middle names"" as first name"") which is playing havoc trying to Manage the Scoot booking. To edit/correct our names, then Scoot now wants an addition fee of $45.78US for both of us.

Their ""Manage"" website is also a real pain... if you turn around and have to do something else, then in a few seconds... they log you out... and have to go through their login nightmare again.

This experience was so bad, I will never ever fly their associated airline... Singapore Airlines either... just will not ever take that chance."
Scoot,Worst customer service ever,1,"Worst customer service ever, passenger rights are not respected at all.
I tried to book a flight from Manila to Berlin via Singapore through the valuealliance.com website and received an error message about the payment. I tried once again, and again the same error message showed saying that there had been a payment error. I received no booking confirmation by email whatsoever.
I then used opodo.de to book my flight, as I urgently needed to show a flight ticket as proof of onward travel for my Philippines visa application.
The next day, I saw that the money for the initial two flights with Scoot had been deducted from my bank account, after all. I still had not received any booking confirmation.
I then called Scoot and was told I would get a refund for both of the flights. Three weeks later, I still haven't received any refund at all, and my emails have not been answered. Upon calling them again, I was told that they tried to reach me over the phone (this is untrue or they did not manage to put ""00"" before the country code) to tell me that only one flight could be refunded. I talked to the customer service for more than one hour, being put on hold over and over again. They tried to find all kinds of excuses why they are not the right contact person (telling me to contact valuelliance, though the contact links directly to them) and why they could only refund one of the flights. I explained I already had a ticket and that the payment error was not my fault. To no avail.
This is a scam and theft of money. Do not book them. The good news is that they will not be successful with this for a long time."
Scoot,Worse than bad,1,"My experience has been a disaster from the beginning. Scoot notified me that our flights would be ‘chartered’ via Singapore Airlines because they don’t have enough airplanes - which sounds to me like a operational issue from their side that I shouldn’t be punished for. Oh but I was. I tried to cancel the flight outright and they said ‘nope’. I asked to speak to a manager and they said ‘sure, s/he will call you back’. I called THREE times and not one manager called me back. The phone answering system itself is a nightmare, loud recorded message barking at you every 10 seconds while you’re on hold. Most times I called they were experiencing higher than average call volume (at what point do they revise that average and hire more staff?) and after explaining my problems I was put on hold several times, then told ‘no, sorry, you have zero rights per the small print Terms of Carriage’ and then told a manager would call within 24 hours, within the hour, as soon as they were off their phone call. Again nope. Oh and also there was no toll free number so I actually paid money to be on hold with these people.

It sounds good that Singapore Airlines would be taking over the flight, but in reality with chartered flights you can’t (a) get access to your booking online, (b) make any seat changes or requests until you check in at the airport (NO online checkin) and (c) get your money back in a timely manner for any of these upgrades that you already paid for. Scoot says I will be paid back ‘4 weeks after my scheduled flight’ for the £84 I spent to select seats. That remains to be seen but my hopes are not high.

In addition, Singapore Airlines can do nothing to help as they are only lending the plane and Scoot is still operating the flight.

As a summary - the airline has bad policies and terrible customer service. Savings on airfare is definitely not worth the headache."
Scoot,AVOID AT ANY COST!,1,"On April 7th, 2019 I entered Malaysia holding a Scoot outbound ticket on May 7th, 2019. Immigration told me I needed to show a return ticket for an earlier date.
A person whom I first thought was an airport official walked up to me and using his own personal cellphone, put me in touch with Scoot´s call center, telling me that I needed to rebook my ticket. He never identified himself as a Scoot representative, I told him I needed to call my bank first since my card has a security block, but he ensured that we needed to solve the issue as soon as possible or immigration would send me back.

I tried to manage my booking through the website and contact my bank but the Scoot´s representative who was in a clear rush, insisted we use the call center, so he dialed again and put me through using his cellphone. When the payment got declined (as expected) the call center representative told me to contact my bank and get back to them. I got an email saying that my booking was NOT complete and that **FARES ARE NOT GUARANTEED UNTIL SCOOT CONFIRMS YOUR BOOKING AND PAYMENT IS MADE IN FULL**

I finally got a fresh new ticket from Scoot´s website and the problem was solved.

Three days later I contacted call center with a question about counter´s opening hours and check-in options, but they told me that I had a pending payment for MYR $1, 600.00 ($400usd). They told me that my booking changes had already been made and that my original ticket was lost.

1) I never got a confirmation of these changes, I had to call to find out.
2)The information I received through email contradicts the information I get through the Call center.
3) There is an extra MYR $200 Call center fee.
4) The original ticket was MYR $700 and now they want me to pay extra MYR $1, 600
5) The Scoot representative who was there with me managing the situation knew all this and didn´t say anything. He knew it was easier and cheaper to just get a new ticket but went and arranged the most expensive and riskier option. He knew that the changes had already been made and advised to buy a new ticket instead of just finishing the current request. Also, he never identified himself as a Scoot staff.

It turns out that the Scoot´s representative was looking after his own and his employer´s interests because he just wanted to go home and wanted to get some sales. I found out he was not an airport official when we were both leaving the airport and asked him about his position. This type of behavior has to be known by potential customers.

I AM REQUESTING THE ORIGINAL TICKET I ALREADY PAID FOR on May 7th, 2017."
Scoot,Do not book SCOOT!!!!,1,"They treated my 79 year old mother very badly. Offloaded her for an unknown reason and when I asked them, they just said it’s not their fault and I have to book her flight again to Germany.
They offer no explanations or discounts in re-booking.
I am letting all my friends from the media know how Scoot treated a senior citizen.

Scoot is a scam!!!!

DO NOT BOOK SCOOT!!!"
Scoot,I have had a harrowing experience,1,"I have had a harrowing experience; i booked a ticket which i was not allowed to cancel, they seem to have a no cancellation policy, something i knew only when i wanted to cancel and my only option was changing the dates for which they charged me extra 50% of the original ticket price. This no cancellation policy is non sense and unethical, and then they are hell bent to charge extra every step of the way. This is daylight robbery and i will try my best not to give them any business in future. it is embarrassing for Singapore Airlines to call this airline a sister concern. it is also demeaning for Singapore to have an airline that is touting every fair practice out there."
Scoot,Ridiculous airline !,1,"Ridiculous airline !! I paid €700 for a flight from krabi to Berlin and when I checked in at the airport I was told that only business class customers have the standard check in 20kg baggage. I had to pay another €200 to get my bag on the flight.
The flight attendants were so rude about it and told me if i should have just booked the business class in the first place ?!! Rudest people I have meet in my 3 months in Asia !! Would recommend to avoid this airline at all costs!!"
Scoot,Terrible booking system but average plane/flight cabin,2,"Scoot internal system is always having error and can’t handle any change in booking without problem although passengers paid additional for the changes. Terrible.

That said, experience on the flight or plane itself has been pleasant with no delay."
Singapore Airlines,Lost baggage and no contact telephone…,2,"Lost baggage and no contact telephone number. Their luggage chat bot is disconnected. You can send an email. So basically not fit for purpose.
Phone number is not answered after many attempts there is totally no communication possible.
I am waiting for the fourth day for my luggage or any contact about it but still nothing."
Singapore Airlines,Constantly declining service,3,"I have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 1986.
They were really good at that time, but I have noticed their service declining over time. The quality of food served, the lack of free toothbrushes and toothpaste.
Today, the flight was delayed by 35 minutes with passengers standing at the gate in Sydney.
No announcements and no apologies.
The pilots arrived promptly but the rest of the crew ""strolled in"" late.
What has happened to common courtesy??
I avoid flying with Airlines based in countries that have bad reputations regarding their human rights etc.
This is why I choose Singapore Airlines and choose to pay more, but it looks like SQ is not a good airline anymore!!"
Singapore Airlines,Upgraded to premium economy diffenately…,2,"Upgraded to premium economy diffenately not worth the money.
I thought I was paying for extra comfort but my husband and I found it very tight and uncomfortable especially when trying to eat.
Would not use this airline again."
Singapore Airlines,Lost baggage and no contact telephone…,1,"Lost baggage and no contact telephone number. Their luggage chat bot is disconnected. You can send an email. So basically not fit for purpose. Add to that no explanation and no apology. And currently no baggage. I am due to travel again tomorrow and needed this luggage to be able to unpack, wash and repack. But I can’t. Let me repeat.
No explanation and no apology"
Singapore Airlines,Pathetic,1,"Flight gets cancelled just before take-off and now stranded in London for more than 24 hours. Digital communication and phone support from airline is non existant. Ground staff not capable of handling this situation well. Dozens of confused passengers roaming around Heathrow like lost sheep looking for help.
I have lost all faith in what used to be a good airline."
Singapore Airlines,Terrible. Online shocking,1,"Terrible
Website hangs suggests one price and then hangs making you leave then gives a double price.
Customer service when called are zero help either. Might be nice V airline when you get on there but getting there is painful. Never again"
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Air Employees Steal Checked Baggage Expensive Items,1,"In Singapore before travel to JFK my large Tumi bag was rifled through and expensive items stolen. Discovered upon arrival in New York.

Considering how much I spent for Business Class tickets, one wonders how Singapore Air maintains any reputation for quality.

Appalling."
Singapore Airlines,Low service standards and many delays,2,"We travelled with Singapore Airlines on a round-trip from Copenhagen to Phuket with a short layover in Singapore for our holiday in January 2025. Thus, this review includes experiences from a total of four flights. We were six family members, including two children and one senior citizen (my mother). We purchased our tickets directly through Singapore Airlines.

The short layover time (just 50 minutes on the way out, and 1 hour and 20 min. returning) had me concerned beforehand, but as the itinerary was suggested by Singapore and they ensured me on phone that it was standard and all fine, we agreed.

I would NOT recommend this for anyone else. Of four flights, three were more than a little delayed. Already from Copenhagen, our flight was an hour delayed, and, of course, we didn't make the transfer to our flight to Thailand. This was stressful, and the cabin crew were not very helpful in informing us of next steps when arriving in Singapore. We had to be very persistent to get them to help us.

They did, however, find us a new departure from Singapore with a decent amount of waiting time. This flight was, however, also seriously delayed.

On the return trip, we only made our transfer in Singapore by storming, panting and panicking, through the airport - mind you, we were travelling with a senior citizen and children (one only four years of age) for whom this transfer proved very physically strenuous and mentally stressful. I had asked the airline for help with the transfer in advance, stressing that the travel party included young children and an elderly woman, but they didn't even send an airport buggy to help us out. As the poor planning was a fault of the airline, and as my mother was travelling on business class, I think transportation between gates in Singapore would have been in order.

On the last flight (Singapore-Copenhagen), the airline had screwed up our meal orders, so my vegetarian sister had to eat a meat-based dish, and the children did not receive their kids' menus. I did pre-register for the special meals five days in advance (and could prove so, as the order was made simultaneously with the business class special menu which my mother DID receive during this flight). This would all have been OK, had the flight attendant not rudely suggested that the fault was mine and suspiciously questioned me about my order (and demanded that I proved to her that I had pre-registered for special meals). That was NOT a pleasant experience when you're already exhausted on a 15-hour travel plan. We never got the meals (except my mother), nor did we receive any kind of apology.

Moreover, even with our best efforts at personal hygiene on board, we managed to become infected with a stomach bug on both trips. The timing lines up perfectly with our time spent on the SA flights (I caught some bug on the way out, and my daughter on the way home). This suggests that the cleaning standards are not as high as one may have hoped travelling with a large, international airline company.

All in all, not the best experience in terms of itinerary or service level. It seems that SA have prioritized short-term income over long-term customer reputation. I won't be choosing Singapore Airlines again, and I strongly recommend others to find alternatives as well.

SA receives two stars from me because the flight itself was, after all, safe (but this should be the expected minimum)."
Singapore Airlines,Always good service,4,"Manchester to Seam Reap via Singapore. Singapore airlines was very good. Clean and relatively new plane, fantastic attentive staff, good food. Good selection of movies too. The time and distance definitely felt long haul, but I arrived surprisingly fresh!"
Singapore Airlines,Will never fly Singapore Airlines…,1,"Will never fly Singapore Airlines again. Booked a flight and needed to change the dates. Was happy to pay the £200 change fee, but they said I had to pay £1,400 extra because they no longer offer the fare type I originally booked. Clearly a ploy to squeeze money out of customers."
Singapore Airlines,Delayed over 24 hours then another…,1,"Delayed over 24 hours then another email with another 3 hours delay. No helpline number nothing what do ever. 4000 miles from home with my family of 3. Utterly disgraceful. First and last time I spend a penny with these clowns. Better service from easyjet which says it all. 27 hours in total. No allowance for hotel, food, taxi, nothing."
Singapore Airlines,Great airline but wheelchair handling Changi appalling,3,Firstly I want to acknowledge the excellent service and hard work of the flying crew who are amongst the best that I have flown with. However as a wheel chair passenger I have to flag the fact that at Changi airport for the second year in a row I was dumped outside the boarding gate by the ground assistance staff and left to flag down a passing attendant to get help to get into the boarding gate. The guy who dropped me off said he would contact staff which he either never did or they failed to respond. Subsequent confusion and physical stress at the security check in despite a tag indicating my assistance required status. With instant back inflammation due to my condition. So if you are a wheelchair passenger avoid Changi. PS...the security cameras never lie. I will now try to avoid transit at Changi. Twice bitten...
Singapore Airlines,Over selling tickets Singapore Airlines,1,"I had heard that Singapore Airlines were overbooking flight from Australia and it happened to me today from Sydney i was booked in business class and they still did this from a 7am I arrived today 3rd January 2025 and waiting for thie 7.10pm flight losing out on my book accommodation in my destination this is a joke, I'm sure will not be recommending Singapore Airlines to anyone

Singapore Airlines,"Friendly, helpful, comfortable",5,"I used Singapore airlines to fly to Phuket from London via Singapore, and return. The airline staff were extremely helpful to me and my friend who had a medical emergency on board. I also saw them be really helpful and supportive to a mother travelling with two small children which both made her journey easier and, selfishly, less noisy for all other passengers. Whilst I didn't want my meals on board they were very quick to check I was OK and offer alternatives.

I'm a larger woman, and had no issues getting a seat belt extender, although I actually found the seats comfortable enough in economy. (making sure I was not encroaching on other people's space)

We did have a relatively late gate change but the app notified me. Overall I couldn't fault it."
Singapore Airlines,Do not choose this Airline if you have a possiblty of changing the date,1,"At the time of buying the ticket, it was indicated $250 and the difference will be charged for changes. But when i tried to change, fare available in online booking was not offered for change but exhorbitant fare (about double the fare as on line) was made as charge for change
I did not travel and forced to cancel return ticket"
Singapore Airlines,Service that makes customers feel like idiots,1,"I was forced to change my seat to a lower grade due to the seating situation I had no control over (and the seat I was moved to had already been used by the passenger next to me, who had left a mess of food behind). The flight itself, which forced me to change seats, was a deeply unpleasant experience, but the nightmare continued.
Despite being told by the flight attendant that customer services would contact me later, I didn't hear from them for a week after the flight, so I contacted them via the support form. I didn't hear from them for a while, and when I finally thought they had contacted me, I received a mechanical reply saying ""We are unable to compensate for this"".
Rather than customer service not working, I felt they were treating the customer like an idiot. I wouldn't give them a single star and I will never use them again."
Singapore Airlines,SQ not the airline it used to be,3,"Flew with SQ a couple of years ago flight/service was good, and paid extra to fly with them again on 6th December 2024 on SQ317 LHR-SIN. Well what a comedown from previous flights. Service was terrible, meals left a lot to be desired. No blankets for the overnight flight for goodness sake. The choice of entertainment was very poor. The plane was very noisy due to a very noisy motor of some kind. No chance of any sleep. We paid more for our flights because we chose SQ rather other major airlines. We will certainly think again before paying this good money if we choose SQ. What has gone wrong at Singapore Airlines?"
Singapore Airlines,Such a great airline!,5,"Such a great airline! flew 4 sectors with my wife and 3 young children and we were treated like royalty on all 4 flights. The staff were all so helpful and lovely, the aircraft seating config was spacious and the food was awesome! lots of extras too! the ground staff were incredible and helped us with a ticket issue we had.

If given the option I will always fly with Singapore Airlines!"
Singapore Airlines,"9 hours in between meals, no sandwiches or snacks as promised…disgraceful upgrade! Gutted we have to fly home and onwards with them",1,"Me and my partner have flown with them for the first time today, on our way to Australia for a holiday…9 hours between meals(12 hour flight), when I asked for the snacks and sandwiches promised on their menu I am advised there’s ‘none left’. They should call it Starving Airlines!

Paid for an upgrade for leg room…yes got the leg room, also got a blue light in my face anytime a passenger pressed the call button whilst trying to sleep. Then my feet and belongings stood on by passengers queuing for the toilet. Disgusting!


Sadly, we have to fly with them on our return journey in 3 weeks, don’t make the same mistake we did! Avoid! I will be complaining when I get back to the UK."
Singapore Airlines,I just returned home to NYC from…,4,"I just returned home to NYC from Singapore after one of the longest direct flights available today, and I am thoroughly impressed with the service, amenities, and overall comfort. Although I flew in economy class, I could see that the business class was exceptional. The next time I travel to Singapore, I’ll definitely consider upgrading to business class!"
Singapore Airlines,Poor handling of luggages,1,Poor handling of luggages. Both my new Samsonite were damaged during SIA flights and one of them was cracked that was beyond repair by Samsonite. SIA simply shifted away from responsibilities with no good reasons and reject my claims. I certainly will not travel on SIA anymore.
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines will have your forgotten items stolen,1,"Singapore Airlines do not do thorough checks after each flight which means that your valuables that you forgot will not be handed over to lost and found. Instead, they will be stolen. Unprofessional, not trustworthy and not responsible."
Singapore Airlines,Rome to Singapore 27 Oct 2024,4,"Rome to Singapore 27 Oct 2024. Business class. Check in, boarding and in flight exceptional service and comfort on this flight.
Only downer was the big suitcase handle was damaged(bent) when we went to retrieve it...made it difficult to transport to hotel for the overnight stay and forward flight from Singapore to Adelaide."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airways save the day,5,We booked to visit our grandchildren in Australia for a months holiday and to witness our granddaughter's first day in school unfortunately my son gave us the incorrect date which would have resulted in us missing that event. We contacted Singapore Airways and explained our predicament and Marcus was able to change our return date so that we will see the first school day of our granddaughter. You've saved the day. Thank you.
Singapore Airlines,Never ever again,1,"Never ever again. SQ used to be such a good airliner, nothing left of that anymore. Such a shame. We were frequent Singapore Airlines travellers 20 years back. Wanted to return and made a booking. Our Krisflyer memberships were expired and we did have to enroll again. Just to enroll and create a membership took 10 hours +. Apparently connected to WiFi with a laptop brought up one bug after another. Even SQ staff assisted while creating. Got so fed up with this I wanted to complain. Another disaster. One cannot complain to a customer relations agent/manager. Apparently a non existence service. I've always got directed to call centers. Whatever I did; emails, contact forms, chat..... Now AFTER 8 WEEKS I am still nowhere. At the call centers they can do nothing as they do not have any authority nor power. They let you turning in circles. I tried to contact the management team in Singapore but to no avail. We are travelling in 2 days. Poor Singapore Airlines, what happens to you? Tumbling from first to twentieth place in the ranking?"
Singapore Airlines,Poor customer service and now being ignored,1,"Extremely disappointed in Singapore Airlines customer services and their representatives lying. Flew to Denpasar in September via Singapore; our luggage was not put on our connecting flight. I was promised by baggage services that all three cases would be delivered later that evening. They did not arrive that night. In fact they arrived a day and a half after our arrival. On our return flight back to London, two cases were damaged. Again, logged this with Singapore Airlines at Gatwick. I wrote a formal complaint claiming compensation under the Montreal Convention including all relevant information and 5 weeks after returning and 4 weeks after writing the complaint, I have not had any acknowledgment to either my complaint or damaged baggage claim. I’m appalled that from an airline that claims to be one of the best in the world that they treat their clients in such a way."
Singapore Airlines,Shirkers of responsibility! Avoid like the plague,1,"After Singapore Dropped the route after putting it on general sale, they refused to rebook me as requested and is stated under EU law. They said only a refund was possible. So I accepted my fate and accepted the refund. However because I used a company called Gotogate they won't issue my refund. Gotogate blame Singapore saying they await the money back from Singapore and Singapore blame gotogate. Tbh I think this may be deliberate tactics by both to shirk responsibly. Perhaps Someone should pick up the phone to Gotogate and make it clear they refund passengers money. After all the worlds supposed best Airline is having it's name dragged through the mud? Disappointed...also you should judge a company by the agents it allows to sell it's tickets"
Singapore Airlines,I got scammed,1,"I got scammed! the airline cancelled my ticket without giving me a refund. I contacted several times the support and they refused to send me official messages or even mail about such problems, they would comunicate only via online chat. Stay away from them!"
Singapore Airlines,Terrible service,1,"Terrible service. They changed my child's seat arrangement without notice, separating the parent and child for a long 14-hour flight."
Singapore Airlines,Shame on you Singapore airlines,1,"Having watched 60 minutes last night, I encourage everyone to write a 0 out of 5 review until Singapore airlines recognise their pilots were to blame for hitting the turbulence that caused so much pain to so many people.
Singapore Airlines made a $3 billion profit last year, they need to do compensate the injured passengers accordingly.
SHAME ON YOU SINGAPORE AIRLINES"
Singapore Airlines,Some Singapore airline cabin crew from…,1,Some Singapore airline cabin crew from Malaysia work here become arrogant and proud look down on typically people Asia people . Then very admire foreigner like white skin colour ! Very arrogant ! Work sia cabin crew can get the bonus a lot very stable very impressive!!!!
Singapore Airlines,The recently reopened Sydney lounge,3,"This is about the recently reopened lounge at Sydney. It is pretty ordinary the usual open space with lots of rows of seats. The biggest disappointment for is the food. The only Asia style food offered was steamed rice and vegetarian stir fried. No chicken rice, noodles or anything else i associate with Singapore food. Even the drinks are ordinary, no real champagne just bubbles and the couple of wines are very ordinary. It is to say the least noting special so if you have the choice go to the Air New Zealand lounge next door."
Singapore Airlines,Uncomfortable seats and hungry on board.,1,"l travelled extensively and flown mostly Singapore Airlines but in the last 2 years of flying with SA , l had found the flights most uncomfortable and the food supplied from Singapore to Australia/ New Zealand / Japan most unpalatable, salty, dried and very tiny portions. Most passengers were hungry within 2 hours and by half journey, the snacks had ran out. Too few toilets with massive queues.
The seats had very little support in Economy class as the planes were old. These seats are not suitable for 12-14 hours flight , it was so bad it was telling us , go economy premium but SA is not cheap.
SA con you with charming flight attendants but that did not compensate for my uncomfortable experience with seats and food.
l am off to Japan and South America soon and l have discontinued future booking with SA. Always review seat and leg room and menu onboard and check the age of the plane of other Airlines. l will definitely consider going premium on my longer flights."
Singapore Airlines,Cancelled our connecting flight without…,1,"Cancelled our connecting flight without notice, customer service non response - unable to make any claims online as they only have their insurance company Allianz contact. Had to purchase another flight. We feel cheated and are now on debt having to book another flight. Still no response to date, we just have an email saying our return flight was cancelled. Left stranded."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines declined compensation for flight delays and bus tickets.,1,"I experienced significant disruptions during my recent roundtrip journey from Manchester to Manila via Singapore. Flight delays on both legs of the trip (Manchester-Singapore and Manila-Singapore) caused me to miss my connecting bus back to Leeds. Despite these disruptions, Singapore Airlines has declined to offer compensation.
Furthermore, my interactions with customer service were unsatisfactory. Representatives were unable to provide clear and concise answers to my questions regarding the flight delays, compensation options, and applicable policies. This lack of clarity and support significantly impacted my travel experience.
Based on these experiences, I will unfortunately be unable to consider Singapore Airlines for future travel."
Singapore Airlines,We flied from Denpansar to Singapore and from Singapore to Germany Frankfurt…,1,"We flied from Denpansar to Singapore and from Singapore to Frankfurt Germany.
18 hours of freezing.
I god so sick because of the low temperatures inside the airplane, so many passengers coughing and asking for more blankets including me, i asked for a sore throat tablets!! AND JUST nobody cared to regulate the temperatures.
Now i am lying in my bed, completely sick and i can not go to work after 3 weeks of holidays!!
It was a disaster experience!!!!"
Singapore Airlines,I'm reviewing your website,1,"I'm reviewing your website, it is shocking, even to call your customer service centre and be hung up on. Getting back to the webpage, it's too difficult to navigate through. I would love for someone that does not work with Singapore Airlines but has an affiliation with you to try this shocking service and see how they go about booking a return flight. I really wanted to book with you but not this way, I'll seek an alternative, wasted too much time on your page already."
Singapore Airlines,Refusing to refund difference for down graded flight,1,"Booked a premium economy flight from Zurich to Singapore September 2024
Connecting flight from Frankfurt to Zurich was delayed
Put on a down graded economy flight with Emirates and Singapore airlines refusing to provide refund for the difference ."
Singapore Airlines,The worst customer service,1,"The worst customer service

Every person I have spoken to in customer service has been actually useless. They cannot answer clear questions, they cannot help you understand policy, it's been a genuine nightmare. I would never fly with Singapore airlines again."
Singapore Airlines,Get the basics right Singapore Airlines!,1,"I have flown with my family with the likes of BA and Virgin and they always endeavour to ensure families sit together. On looking at my booking for one month's time for my first flight on Singapore Airlines, I was shocked to see there were only 4 seats left, at completely different sides of the cabin, meaning our family can't sit together for a 13 hour flight.
My children are prone to sickness too.
How can they claim to be a family friendly airline when they don't ensure families sit together as a basic and obvious need?
Customer service is worst than useless.
This will be my first and last time flying with them. Back to BA and Virgin for future holidays."
Singapore Airlines,Follow up with left-behind cabin baggage was excellent,4,"Flew into Changi from Milan. Granddaughter left her iPad in seat pocket at Changi, by the time we realised we were already boarding the Melb fight. Contacted SATA from Melbourne via the online enquiry form then followed up with a number of emails. So a fair bit of faffing around over a few weeks but the end result was that they delivered the iPad to the Singapore Airlines office at Melbourne airport at no cost to us."
Singapore Airlines,Have booked our 1st holiday to bali…,1,"Have booked our 1st holiday to bali travelling on Singapore Airlines 1st time but they're so UNHELPFUL. In the past have always travelled with British Airways and virgin Atlantic and both have been fantastic. I'm disabled and have requested bulkhead seats from other Airlines atleast 6 to 8 weeks prior to travelling and they've helped me. This time I did the same as my husband has cancer and other health issues too but all Singapore Airlines keeps doing is asking me to pay £82 for 1 seat and if we want to sit together elsewhere have to pay £132. They just don't care about customer care.

THIS WILL BE MY 1ST AND LAST TRIP ON THIS AWFUL AIRLINES.

😟😟😟😟🥹😟😟😢😢😢😢😢😥😥😥😥😥😥😥"
Singapore Airlines,What a shame,3,"Some meals were inedible, cabin temperature on a 10hr leg from Johannesburg was uncomfortably cold.
People on the plane were walking around to socialise or just standing in the aisle without regard to safety. Check-in staff lied and told me that I had been given an aisle seat. Despite pleasant in flight staff, I will try to avoid this company."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines cancelled our flight…,1,"Singapore airlines cancelled our flight without informing us and rebooked us on a flight 2 days later when we were both back in work. We only found this out at the point of check in. No emails, calls l, messages.

They were of little help when we phoned them offering no alternative flights home, and a refund that was less the 10% of the original ticket price.

Very evasive and unwilling to help in any meaningful way. Wouldn't recommend as we are currently thousands out of pocket due to needing to book alternative flights home from Singapore at a days notice."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines staff despise economy pax!,1,"Singapore airlines was once a company that prided itself on service, it would appear that has changed. While at Perth airport l had need to go to the service desk with a query about my flight. You would have thought l had asked the counter staff to remove one of her legs, after 40 minutes l was redirected to a young man that dismissed me as l had what he called a ""lower end"" ticket. Keep in mind this ""lower end"" ticket was purchased after an email from Singapore airlines. So in short why have a service counter that does not provide service and why sell tickets that your staff see as beneath their time to deal with?"
Singapore Airlines,Avoid this Airline,1,"After only being given a prawn option as a meal, I stated that I had an allergy to prawns so therefore would accept the tray as I had not made the airline aware prior to taking the flight. The tray arrived with a prawn salad side dish. Appalling customer service both inflight and online.
My review however is for the overall standard of this airline which has dropped considerably over the last year or so, therefore if flying economy, would avoid at all costs. Reviews of those in business/first class are unrealistic. As a frequent flyer through work I am now opting for any of the Middle Eastern airlines when possible which are far superior to Singapore Airlines. Really disappointing when I am about to turn to gold frequent flyer status with Krisflyer. Avoid at all costs."
Singapore Airlines,Phone battery died while on hold,1,"As of this afternoon, I was put on hold during the 6th call for 40 minutes until my landline phone battery died! Had to call back again to inform SIA to call me back once their accounts department is able to tell me exactly what’s going on and when I can expect repayment. This time SIA could not find my payment!!! What is happening?!?!? Needless to say, I still haven’t received any repayment."
Singapore Airlines,Worst experience ever,1,"Cairns-Singapore; Singapore-Frankfurt. The first flight had a delay of more than 1 hour and so I missed my connecting flight. They said my next flight wasn’t willing to wait 5 more minutes. Singapore Airlines than rebooked me to another flight, through which i had to change the flight even 1 more time in Zurich and would arrive 4 hours later than i would have with the planned flight. On top of that they didn‘t send my luggage with me and it was still in Singapore when I arrived. Funny because I even asked the staff what would happen to my luggage when I arrived in Singapore and they told me it would be transferred with me as well. Worst airline experience ever. - Junhao Cao"
Singapore Airlines,Ground staff at airport,2,"My parents Travel to India through Singapore airline they have paid for wheel chair service.
But when they reached Singapore they have refused to provide a wheel chair.My dad is on medication he hardly walk that why I booked a wheel chair service.
Fortunately other passangers help them and assist him to the gate.
Singapore airport ground staff attitude is really bad towards people who don’t speak the same language and doesn’t know how to treat passangers they need to do their job properly not just take the passangers money and put in their pocket."
Singapore Airlines,Put on hold for >30mins,1,"We just got out of covid and i only started travelling extensively from Feb 23 onwards.

Otherwise, my qualifying period for Elite status is from 27 Jul 22 to 31 Jul 23. I am short by 6k+ miles and ask them for 1 month extension on the qualifying period as i have already booked 2 outbound flight in Aug 23 to achieve the mileage. During my 3rd call, the customer service officer from Philippines Bam put me on hold for more than 30mins while she claimed to have ""talked"" to her supervisor about the situation. She of course reverted with the same reason that if mileage is more than 5k short, they can't put the case up for review! Well done SIA!!"
Singapore Airlines,Please upgrade your website - you are losing business !,1,"Please upgrade your website - it is completely useless when prompts don't work and information which is entered does not register. You are left sitting in a page that does not process anything and does not let you proceed in the reservation process. You are losing online business. I have attempted several times to book flights on the Singapore Airlines website to be told that my password is invalid, but it does not allow me to reset it. Does Singapore Airlines no longer want loyal customers ? I ended up booking with other airlines on more than one or two or three occasions. Very disappointing !"
Singapore Airlines,Booked premium economy from Melbourne…,1,Booked premium economy from Melbourne to London 30/3/23. On the second leg my wife's seat would not recline and staff were unable to fix it. I spent a lot of money to use a 'premium' service and was offered a SID150 voucher as compensation. I have refused this and fought Singapore Airlines all the way. The fact is I paid for a service that I did not receive and Singapore Airlines has essentially stolen my money through refusing my reasonable request for appropriate cash recompense. I believe there is at heart a serious cultural problem in this airline. They think they are the best but the reality is that their glory days are behind them.
Singapore Airlines,Beware of Singapore Airlines,1,I dont recommend this airline. They have changed my flight without any email notification. I booked my return for 27 July but they moved it to 28 July and they do not even provide free accommodation. Booking with this airline is such a waste of money and time. Please beware
Singapore Airlines,Useless customer care,1,"Their customer care is absolutely useless. My husband tried adding his frequent flyer number to the flight booking. But they won't allow it because his name ""doesn't match"". This is because his first name and middle name hasn't got a space on the flight ticket which is correct! I have purchased flight ticket via an agency. They wouldn't add my frequent flyer number on the booking as I will need to do it via agency. Just a lot of excuses to try and avoid work and make it difficult for the customers!"
Singapore Airlines,"Great service, rubbish website",1,"If you miss the days of dial-up and frustrating UI, you'll love SingaporeAir's website. It's not only slow, it will decide to make you put in all your infomation again because it decides not to bother saving your passport/ frequent flyer miles/ something else. Sisyphus must have designed it."
Singapore Airlines,Doesn't look after its loyal customers,2,"Singapore airlines is great unless you need to make a change, then they dig deep into your pockets. The App is awful and gives widely inaccurate information on change of flights details. If you need to change a date, even on a flexible ticket you are often much better off buying a new ticket with another airline. Its difficult to get to speak to the right person with their automated service, like being on a merry-go-round without the fun."
Singapore Airlines,Very flexible and kind,5,We booked economy lite tickets for our trip from London to Australia. Unfortunately we have a family member who has become unwell. After a lot of back and forth Singapore Airlines very kindly waived the flight change / difference fees which were almost £2000. They recognised we were in a very difficult and upsetting position and really went to extra mile to help us. We are very grateful. Thank you
Singapore Airlines,Especially from singapore to kathmandu…,1,"Especially from singapore to kathmandu nepal ,they really need to upgrade the facilities such as atleast an infotainment system.
It feels like 4 days just to travel 4 hrs flight
Plzz do something."
Singapore Airlines,Requested for receipt for my flights…,1,"Requested for receipt for my flights every agents has a different statement regarding on the process. Rude, promise not kept and the worst is they provided a differ time frame everytime I chatted them. Will not use your service again. Just only for a receipt and the process is almost a month."
Singapore Airlines,No transparency and waste of time - Poorest customer service experience,1,"As part of my student privileges I get 1 free change which they caused unnecessary delays of over 2 weeks to help me with. They have been asking personal information and the exact same documents repeatedly with me talking to different representatives over the same thing again and again. They will act like they want to help but will actually provide no transparency and will only waste your time. In fact, their technical team prevented me from logging in to my account and magically on making a complaint and sending them screenshots of reduced fares, they responded and took 2 weeks more to let me login to my account. Their actions need to be reported. Not sure if our data is even secure with them"
Singapore Airlines,Flight was like being in a cattle truck…,1,"Flight was like being in a cattle truck 13 hours in cramped conditions hour and a half into flight handed a tray full of food cheese and crackers included, they never came back with coffee apparently you have to ask for it but it's only given as t meal times so basically your eating dinner with glass of water, glass of wine and a coffee in majorly cramped seats then after dinner we have to pull shutters closed and lights out for 9 hours then quick breakfast before we landed. No snacks or water during flight. Never again worst airline I've been on"
Singapore Airlines,Scam airline. SA need to be investigated.,1,"I wanted to change flight dates and went to the app, however they greyed out the Manage Flights and it instructed me that I need to contract customer service.
I called them but having someone search with a super old/slow system for multiple dates and times was excruciating and very confusing. I demanded that I be allowed to make changes online and the agent said she raised it for the IT team to fix. 24 hours later and still no online access, I called again as I decided I would just change the flight on the phone as I had no choice.
In 24 hrs the price had risen £150. They had zero empathy and were patronising, saying it was my fault for having not booked the first time.
In 2024, prohibiting customers from making complicated flight changes online is outrageous. They only do this to frustrate customers and ensure they postpone changes until the prices are much higher.
I waited 25 mins on hold for the second guy to speak to a superviser, after which he told me it was all my fault.
I’m beyond appalled. They make billions, yet have old systems, horrible customer experience, and it must be a horror show working for them."
Singapore Airlines,I had always enjoyed my flying…,3,I had always enjoyed my flying experience with SIA but I have yet to receive the refund for one of my cancelled flights and it has been 1 month now.
Singapore Airlines,Poor Show Singapore Airlines,1,"Flying Business class from Heathrow to Brisbane on 30/09/24 on Flight SQ305 scheduled to depart at 9.25am.
Get a WhatsApp message at 04.19 to say the flight is delayed and pushed back to 13.40pm.
Big problem this means I miss my connecting flight to Brisbane and they re-route my journey via Port Moresby Papua New Guinea with an airline I have never heard of which makes me and my Wife very nervous.
My request to Singapore airlines was to stay overnight in Singapore and fly to Brisbane the next day. They did not say if they would arrange and cover the cost of the overnight stay. That was a no go other than to offer a flight 1 day later from Singapore to Brisbane in economy with no compensation for downgrading.
Not what you would expect from this airline so this will be my first and last experience of flying with them, no help whatsoever. Emirates every time in future.
I will be lodging a complaint and will expect compensation for the stress and inconvenience caused to me and my Wife."
Singapore Airlines,5*....Don't make me laugh,2,5* airlineDon't make me laugh! In economy you are treated like cattle. Stewards disappear for hours on end. Toilets not cleaned. Food was inedible. Virgin and BA much superior
Singapore Airlines,Bad treatment and cannot be trusted,1,"Singapore airlines sells you the most expensive tickets if you want to convert your credit cards' points to miles. Be very careful. Their call centre staff hang up on you when you call them to ask why there is a long ""wait list"" when there are hundreds of seats available. Well of course they want to sell the seat at the highest price."
Singapore Airlines,We travelled Premium Economy Singapore…,1,"We travelled Premium Economy Singapore to Melbourne. The seat mechanism to recline & to raise the leg rest required superhuman force, and then it jammed. The seat pocket was broken. I booked the cook but the meal I ordered was not served. Instead I received oily curry puffs in a cardboard box, followed by 2 choices. I selected fish in a gloppy green sauce & tired vegetables.The fare was the same for economy.Champagne was cheap, nasty & acidic.There is more leg room but very expensive for what it is. Next time I’ll fly economy & pay for an exit row seat for the extra leg room."
Singapore Airlines,"Great help from Miko, Rahmad and Vicky",5,"In the afternoon of Tuesday 9 January me and my family travelled from Medan to Singapore. Due to circumstances we had to reschedule the flight for a family member. We had great help from Miko, Rhamad and Vicky of Singapore Airlines and everything was arranged that we could travel with our whole family united. We are very thankful to the people of Singapore Airlines and Miko, Rhamad and Vicky especially. Best regards Prof dr Peter van der Kraan ( The Netherlands)"
Singapore Airlines,BE AWARE ON LONG HAUL FLIGHTS !,1,"BE AWARE ON LONG HAUL FLIGHTS - BAGS REMOVED

Singapore airlines will happily removed baggage from flights. They did so on a recent NY to Singapore flight for several passengers, including me to to save on fuel. This is common practice by them, so no problem.

Problem is it took 3 days to receive my actual bags, all contact is with an outside agency in the meantime who really don't care and if you try and ask for any compensation afterwards Singapore Airlines simply ignore you.

Ive messaged 3 times over 2.5 months, all I receive is a reply to say someone will contact you, but they never do, just look at the other reviews.

So if flying long haul and your bags and items are actually important to you (wild thought), Id be careful and possibly avoid."
Singapore Airlines,Horrible experience,1,"Horrible experience, the service was so poor. They lost my baggage and after finding it. They made me wait an entire day and I still haven’t received the baggage. Horrible experience ever. I will never fly ever again."
Singapore Airlines,"I had to cancel a return international…. ""How can I talk to someone about this !""",3,"I had to cancel a return international flight within the 72 hour cutoff time. I’m old school and like to speak with a customer rep.
Emergency contact number took my call and noted the cancellation, fine.
I found the assistance form process sent by the airline confounding.
What I found out is; you can be forwarded to a real live assistant via the “ Lets Chat” bot at bottom right hand side of webpage. After three days plus me trying to get it sorted they had it verified in two minutes.
Go to the chat bot; request to be transferred to a customer assistant ; )"
Singapore Airlines,Bad experience of delay and the airline…,1,"Bad experience of delay and the airline won’t pay any compensation.
My flight from London to Manila transit at Singapore was delayed for 8 hours. I had to book a hotel at Singapore airport during long hour transit. It was caused by the delay of their second leg of the flight. I contacted airline after and they insists they won’t give me any compensation, they only offered some air miles. I told them I’m not going to use them ever so why offer me that.
I will never use it again"
Singapore Airlines,Wonderful airline. Full Stop.,5,"Wonderful airline. We have flown SIA business and first class, 6-7 times over the past two years (long-haul) and absolutely love it. Cannot fault the service and the customer team has always been accommodating, thank you!"
Singapore Airlines,All my trips to Australia have been…,5,"All my trips to Australia have been with SIA, from booking flights to airport booking in, never had any issues, lovely ground staff and aircraft stewards and stewardesses, last time I had an upgrade flying from Heathrow to Perth, really spoilt by all the staff, excellent service.
Would only fly with SIA . They spoilt me , how can I fly economy when I have experienced business class?
Thank you SIA, I look forward to flying with you later this year (2023)"
Singapore Airlines,0/10,1,"Seat space is terrible and they’ve definitely added more seats into economy on their long hauls. On a 14 hour flight were only fed one hour into the flight and one hour before landing. When asked for a snack off the menu was told only a small muffin was available when they advertised there being sandwiches and more filling options. Staff were very rude on one of our flights. On return we were unable to do online check in and as a result were not even sitting together. As a nervous flyer this was a nightmare. Will never spend my money with this airline again, the quality has dropped through the floor."
Singapore Airlines,Devenu une mauvaise compagnie,2,"I remember when Singapore Airlines was one of the top 2 airlines in the world, today it's a shoddy company. Bali / Singapore, we had a B787 in good condition for 2h30 flight, for Singapore / Paris, we had an old worn B777 for 13 hours of travel, it's a shame. The staff is not friendly, the distribution of meals is an ordeal for them. family and I will no longer choose Singapore Airlines, which I had advised everyone.
I am very angry about the quality of your service"
Singapore Airlines,I booked my flight to Denpasar,1,"I booked my flight to Denpasar, nine months ago. I booked my usual seat. fast forward to the trip Singapore Airways took my seat away and give it to a family on standby with a child because they said they needed a bassinet and then they never used it. I booked a seat because I have a knee problem and now I have to spend three weeks in Bali with a bad knee. The apology was this a credit at being tea leaf for a coffee. Singapore airways have changed from quality to quantity and they obviously and they don’t care."
Singapore Airlines,ATTN: protect your hard earned money and fly emirates,1,"Absolutely shocking service ! When you ask for them to deal with anything other than a sale they have no idea what to do or say. They did not advocate for me with the airline the way a travel agent should. Instead became rude to me. Protect your money and use someone else.
Attached is an email from Singapore stating that once I send “proof” through that an unexpected error occurred during the booking process they would issue me a cancellation/ refund. They still won’t tell me exactly what is considered “proof”

It also states “the passenger should review the flight once I receive the confirmation number otherwise I can request cancellation or refund”
I can only receive a confirmation number after I have booked. So as soon as I received this confirmation number I tried to correct the error and no one is telling me still what is considered “proof“"
Singapore Airlines,See above,4,"I travelled from Singapore to London on 7/8 august 2023 on flight 322 . I was a disabled passenger who needed a fair amount of assistance. The flight attendants were Bhoomica, Angie, Low, Effa, Moo, Taha and Muneera. The flight attendants were wonderful - always ready to help me without a fuss. Very caring and welcoming. I would like to thank these individual attendants for their attention. They made the flight so pleasant . I hope you will pass on my thanks to these individuals and the Airline. Thank you.

Singapore Airlines,Overly expensive for the same service…,1,"Overly expensive for the same service from other direct flights. My experience is from economy and premium economy.

There were promotions later in June (stating flights from £667 from 14 August to 7 Dec) but when clicked, in spite of complying with all conditions, there was nothing close except for two weeks or so at the end of November. This was offered from November in an earlier promotion.

When quieried, Singapore Airlines did not care, responding with repetitive excuses which were irrational."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines staff abused me…,1,Singapore airlines staff Theo called me a child via an email message ( which i have a copy of ) when i asked them how to claim miles for Krisflyer. I contacted the head of customer service Fran Reyes but no response.
Singapore Airlines,SCAM?,1,"Now you have spent on credit cards, flew with Singapore Airlines and Star Alliance etc etc. and accumulated your miles in your KrisFlyer account. Time to redeem and enjoy, right?
NO, you will hit the wall with Singapore Airlines. How? well, Singapore Airlines management knows that well. But you, the customers may not know. Almost 99% of the redeemable good value purchase with miles fares are not displayed or there is a waitlist. This is how Singapore Airlines screw you. That is exactly as I write. It feels like a scam to me. I am usually right about my feelings. And their customer service is useless, lip service over the telephone. Not to mention that your miles will eventually expire because of inactivity. Good luck to get screwed."
Singapore Airlines,"""Worst service ever",1,"""Worst service ever! The airline's check-in staff charged me an extra $200 for a 10kg backpack, just slightly over the 7kg carry-on limit. This experience was incredibly frustrating and inflexible. Furthermore, it felt like she/he was racist toward me because of my nationality. I strongly discourage this airline."""
Singapore Airlines,Flight cancelled whilst trying to find…,1,"Flight cancelled whilst trying to find bag drop in T2 at Heathrow.There then ensued total chaos, with passengers shepherded into what can only be described as a holding pen. Literally nothing happened for hours, we were standing by a lady in her eighties that was visibly struggling. We had to point this is out to a SIA rep. The handling of the delay was truly incompetent. SIA shouldn’t be operating large aircraft if they can’t do better than this utter shambles.
Now booked on another flight 2 days later, with our 12year old daughter separated by 8 rows of seats. She is absolutely petrified. Ryanair do a better job than this.
There are other flights available much sooner but obviously will incur SIA some cost. What a cheap nasty airline this is. I am truly shocked at how poorly SIA have dealt with this situation, woeful in every respect.

I honestly think, actually I honestly know, SIA doesn’t actually care one jot.
They’re not alone most airlines are the same, it’s just the total hypocrisy of trying to portray themselves as some kind of elite 5 star airline when in fact nothing could be further from the truth."
Singapore Airlines,We love our flight,5,"Our flight to Singapore from London Heathrow was just amazing. It was 13 hours direct flight with Airbus A380.
The staff was amazing, kind, polite, friendly and professional. On the board they offered a lot of options as a food and drinks, nice choice of nibbles that we loved. The seats are very comfortable, each seat is provided with pillow and blanket, eye masks and sets of headphones to connect to your screen. It was a huge option of films and music.In the toilet you can find all amenities that you may need like toothbrush and toothpaste, period pads.
We really enjoyed the flight and the amazing Singapore."
Singapore Airlines,First time with Singapore Airlines and definitely not the last.,5,"From start to finish Singapore airline were excellent. I needed assistance and could not have asked for anything better. Flew business class from Amsterdam to Singapore then and singapore to Sydney.
Singapore airport was beautiful and the business class lounge there is the best I have seen. Staff all very attentive, with excellent food and service. We flew on the A350 but from Sydney to Singapore it was the A380. Thought the A380 was uncomfortable and had to sit/sleep at an angle. Minor thing but definitely prefer the A350."
Singapore Airlines,Bad experiwnce,1,"Bad experiwnce

My past experience with Singaporean was ok, the food on the plane and the lounge is good. The staff are polite.

BUT this time I flew to Sydney form Copenhagen via Singapore and return. And wow what a bad experience. Even though I had specifically bought the ticket as a SAS Code Share and logged my SAS EUROBONUS loyalty number. The Singaporean just added my mileage to Kris world (their loyalty program) to some account, which I have but never use.

There exists no costumer service with the Singaporean loyalty program (kris world) and I could not get them to undo the mistake. I had to get the good guys at SAS EUROBONUS to help me.

As I fly a lot my status with SAS EUROBONUS is important. Therefore I will avoid Singaporean in the future !!!!"
Singapore Airlines,Worst service we ever received from any…,1,"Worst service we ever received from any business.

We took a flight from Katmandu to Singapore in Dec last year. Out over head AC wasn’t working so our space was super-hot like oven.

And worst we couldn’t take our connecting flight from Melbourne to Canberra because Singapore Air didn’t book ticket for my daughter.

We had to hire a car and drove whole night to reach Canberra.

I have raised a complaint in Feb 2023 but still no resolution. We haven't got our money back for the flight we couldn’t took.

I was using Singapore Air for last 14 years but I will do our best to avoid this airlines and will share and advise everyone I know to avoid this air."
Singapore Airlines,WORST AIRLINE!! RUBBISH SERVICE,1,"WORST AIRLINE!!! Cost me money for their incompetence as an airline. Been making a complaint to be told by the rude staff they won’t speak to anyone on the phone and all done by email. Won’t just pick up the phone and actually provide customer care. The plane was old, dirty and not what I expected. EASY JET provides a better service. Shocking company. Make sure to avoid."
Singapore Airlines,Flew into a cyclone into Auckland,1,Flew into a cyclone into Auckland Airport in February. Plane almost crashed on landing. Baggage took 8 days to arrive (couldn't remove baggage from plane as too windy). The holiday should have been cancelled.
Singapore Airlines,Substandard airline,2,"I have no idea how this is the world's best airline!! Below average service, flight was very uncomfortable - outdated technology, and the list goes on.
Emirates is miles better. Not going to make the mistake of flying with Singapore airlines ever again."
Singapore Airlines,Zero stars.,1,"Zero stars.
Very disappointed with Singapore air. Not so much due to in flight issues, but from a customer service/policy standpoint.
I had hundreds of thousands of air miles banked with the airline. These are miles I accumulated by spending hard earned money to receive.
One day I logged on to use the miles and they were gone. I called Singapore and they told me that the miles had expired. I did NOT receive a warnings about this and when the issue was looked into, I was simply told - sorry no miles anymore.
This is really an insult. If you bank miles for future use with an airline, what gives them the OK to simply zero them out???
I will never fly with them again and I have pulled my company account as well. I advise that you choose them wisely and look around for alternative travel."
Singapore Airlines,CHECK your charges,1,"CHECK your charges! Was supposed to be charged X amount and ended being charged extra $140 AUD. I emailed SIA to credit the difference but after 2 months of emails and investigation of the problem, they said it is my bank's fault. I contacted my bank and they replied within one day to say that it is indeed SIA putting through the extra charges. I emailed the reply from my bank to SIA and SIA has stopped replying. I am so disappointed. Why is it so hard to get good customer service these days? My bank has advised me to initiate a dispute in the transaction and initiate a chargeback but this was not the desired outcome i wanted. Customers are just not looked after anymore these days. So disappointed and appalled at SIA customer service!"
Singapore Airlines,Watch out you dont get a Scoot flight,2,"You pay a full amount on Singapore website . You are a Golden member with free access to their lounges (waist of money all that warm food ,better give me extra discount).
And than one leg of the flight schedule is from scoot.
Than Singapore Airlines wil not help you in Anny way and you can not check in online and also no lounge acces.."
Singapore Airlines,Flees on the plane,1,Just got back from New Zealand with Singapore airline’s absolutely covered in flee bites. The plane had trash under the seat when I boarded and now my arms and legs are covered in bites. Absolutely disgusting
Singapore Airlines,A let down and disappointing,3,"Great customer service from call handler however was let down by air cabin crew. They missed me out in serving me food in the plane and later when I complained and asked for a cup of tea, this was refused. I went to the toilet 20 minutes before landing was due and the air cabin crew was banging the door to tell me to get back to my seat. Terrible service from air cabin crew. I will be looking to book with other airlines as they are half the price and even if the service is like what I experienced at Singapore Airlines."
Singapore Airlines,Please don’t fly with Singapore Airlines,1,"Just know the risk if you need to access customer service from Singapore airlines they are hopeless.
They can’t take action, they escalate without callbacks, lose your reference number and don’t take any remediation action to resolve what was a simple issue.

I was meant to have my flight points credited to virgin Australia (their partner airline) but they mistakenly didn’t do so, then proceeded to have me call more than 8 times, spend an hour on the phone, not call me back despite saying they would and completely dismissing any responsibility.

A small issue, but handled horribly and not resolved as yet."
Singapore Airlines,Unable to find lost baggage from an AirTag Map,1,"A week ago I flew from Brussels to Singapore via Zurich, my wife's suitcase arrived, mine didn't.
The Singapore Lost and Found department said it was almost sure to be in Zurich as the transfer time between flights was short.
Cutting the story short, after sending an Apple AirTag map showing that it was still in Zaventem Airport, A week after departure I'm still getting regular ""trying to locate"" messages from their computer, and even received an email asking ""if my concerns have been attended to and resolved"" almost at the same time as another ""trying to locate"" message!
Nobody seems to be able to use the map and bag description to find it."
Singapore Airlines,If you cannot sit in economy with the arm rests down pay for 2 seats!,3,"Airlines really need to specify that if you cannot fit in an economy seat with the arm rests down, you really need to book two seats. I flew Perth to Singapore next to a very large woman and her quite tall husband. She could not sit in her seat with the arm rests down meaning she was occupying part of MY seat as well as her husband's. Their daughter conveniently took a seat in the row behind her parents leaving a paying stranger to share their seat with the mother. I spent 5 hours with my seat belt on squashed up against the plane wall and window. The Singapore crew said nothing. In effect I paid for part of her seat!
I was even travelling with a fractured vertebra and as a passenger needing assistance. Just awful."
Singapore Airlines,1st Class Ticket Budget Airline Customer Service,1,"Poor Customer Service - First Class ticket - Budget airline service. No ""Book the Cook"" options if you require special meals* - Gluten free diet. Attempted to negotiate food options for a month before flight - and recieved poor service from reservation and feedback service.

*On a Gluten free diet for health reasons."
Singapore Airlines,Best trip ever?,4,"Once had a chance to use this airline when I was forced to have a trip around this country by my company. I wasn't really against the trip around Singapore, because it is a great country, I was just lazy to go to a business trip but it's a side question... Speaking of the airline, then I liked everything. I entered the website, booked a flight in the blink of an eye, as the section where you need to buy tickets is right in front of your eyes. Moreover I examined conditions on using business class cabin and I liked it. The price doesn't matter much as trip is paid by the company =) So I used this opportunity and perhaps had a best trip ever."
Singapore Airlines,Consumer protection violation,2,"I have just finished an incredibly disappointing experience with Singapore Airlines. I was informed that my initial flight was delayed by approximately two hours, which meant I would miss my connecting flight. Instead of rebooking me on a comparable flight, the airline transferred me to their low-cost partner, Scoot. This substitution seems to violate consumer protection laws, as I had paid for a flight that included in-flight entertainment, complimentary meals and drinks, and access to a power outlet—all of which I did not receive. To add to the frustration, I arrived at my destination more than two hours late. The entire process was completely automated so I had no opportunity to voice my frustration. I feel robbed."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines should have customer…,1,Singapore airlines should have customer service numbers easily available to customers. It took me several hours to reach a live customer service to cancel my flight a chatbot is not helpful. Yes I submitted a form to cancel my flight thru the website but was still uneasy since the policy says i have 24 hours to cancel without charges. And besides canceling thru the website keeps you questioning because there is no confirmation email sent regarding my request.
Singapore Airlines,Bad exchange-rate between CHF/EUR,3,"There was a bad exchange-rate between CHF/EUR from Singapore Airlines. I lost approximately 40 Euros because of the bad exchange-rate between Swiss Francs and Euros. For 880,20 Swiss-Francs, I was paying 940,78 Euros (actual official exchange-rate was 0,98). I am not used such ""tricks"" from such a famous Airline. There is also a ""manipulation fee"" of 14,11 Euros on my Mastercard."
Singapore Airlines,Fabulous Flight,5,"After Many years i flew with SIA from Singapore to Colombo on BC SQ 468 as i boarded one of the crew members took my hand luggage andput it away for me which took me by surprise

Singapore Airlines,I was given food poisoning on the…,1,"I was given food poisoning on the flight and they have taken zero responsibility. Said it could have been due to stress. It was the only food I ate for 12 hours and can confirm it was from them.
Never want to fly with them again.
It's been 2 months and only now I'm just getting a response - never fly with them"
Singapore Airlines,"Good service, uncomfortable seat",3,"The service was good and staff were friendly, however, my seat was broken and it was a 13 hour flight. I couldn’t move my seat up or down and was extremely uncomfortable trying to sleep sitting completely upright. Would have been a much higher review if I wasn’t so horribly uncomfortable"
Singapore Airlines,Poor customer service,1,"Poor customer service! Robotic reply ""i am sorry"" ""i understand"" Had spoked/chat with at least 5 agent supports, non of them really pay attention. ""we will look into it"" ""sorry non refundable"" Hello! i am not asking for full refund, i am asking to check as i was overcharged. Do they listen? No! Even i provided proof, they still stated, ""sorry there is no possible of refund. Have a nice day"" What kind of service this is? Very disappointed. If only one can pay attention and listen to the customer, i won't have to made so many calls repeating raising my issues ended nothing solved. Not only took my time and energy and even lead a scammer imposnate SIA staff trying to compensate me but instead trying to scam me. Never again!"
Singapore Airlines,WORST EXPERIENCE with SIA'S Customer Service,1,"WORST experience with their Customer Services. My son wanted to book his student fare tickets. Verified that he was a student by SheerID but somehow unable to access the portal to book. Called/emailed SIA several times and requested for them to help him book over their end but they refused; yet SIA can't fixed his problem to access the portal to book. It has been over a month, and numerous phone calls/emails and yet cannot resolved. He wanted to book when the price was reasonable, now it is so high and SIA refused to acknowledge that, and still have no solution to resolve the issue. I still haven't book his ticket and was pushed here and there. SIA also keep making me resend printscreens to verify this and that, which we did, many time. PLEASE ... LET SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE CONTACT ME ASAP!"
Singapore Airlines,We booked our flights a full 9 months…,1,"We booked our flights a full 9 months in advance and paid well over $11,000 for a trip in 2 weeks time. we then booked our trip around the flights. Over the past 2 months they changed our flights over 6 times resulting in over 15 hours of stop overs and delays, making the trip almost 32 hours long.
We booked through flight centre and paid the extra to be able to cancel the flights.
Now we're having to fight tooth and nail just to get a response let alone our money back.
We're now at the unenvious point of paying for litigation to reclaim our funds that they have had for 9 months to use as they wish.
I have flown well over 30 times with this airline and our business and family hundreds of times but this is the end of our relationship and we will never fly or recommend them again.
Such poor integrity."
Singapore Airlines,Bad customer service experience,1,"We booked a ticket with more than a 10-hours layover in Singapore. We emailed customer service with our booking reference to ask if we could extend our layover to visit the city. After a few days, customer service replied, asking for photos of our passports and confirmation of the passenger names. We sent our documents in an email, and the next day, we received a response from Singapore Airlines stating that our tickets cannot be changed and are non-refundable.

I would have understood if Singapore Airlines had informed us that the layover extension was not possible in their first reply. However, after requesting all our information and passports, we expected that the extension would be granted. Instead, we received a refusal, which felt like a slap in the face.

We are not happy with the customer service and do not think we will fly with Singapore Airlines again."
Singapore Airlines,Absolutely disgusted with the company,1,"Absolutely disgusted with the company, would give 0 if possible.

Changed my destination without any options to get to the same destination even on a different date. Refund has to be miles because they have already cancelled my flight once, so I had to repurchase a flight that worked with me using miles. And now I can’t even get my cash back. Their miles are useless anyway because they still can’t get me to my original destination.

Additionally, My wife called initially to enquire for me, and couldn’t make changes because she was
not the person flying. Today when I called and I asked to authorise my wife to make changes on behalf of me, and was told she is able to as long as she can pass the verification questions, which she did yesterday. There was an alternative yesterday that my wife would’ve accepted."
Singapore Airlines,I had the worst experience with this…,1,"I had the worst experience with this airline manager, Nariandar Khalsi from Mumbai Airport terminal 2, during my recent flight. When I approached them for assistance during the check-in process, they were incredibly unhelpful and downright rude. They showed zero empathy or concern for my situation, leaving me feeling stranded and frustrated. It's shocking that someone in a customer service role could be so indifferent to passengers' needs. I will never fly with this airline again, and I strongly advise others to steer clear if they value even a shred of customer service."
Singapore Airlines,I’d give zero stars if I could,1,"I’d give zero stars if I could. I always see online that Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines. But in my experience they are the worst I’ve ever flown on. I was humiliated and singled out on an outward flight by a flight attendant. Abused by a fellow passenger who was protected by the attendant regardless that I clearly was the victim. This was over a seat issue which on complaining to customer services at a later time they actually admitted that my seat was faulty!! As a female flying solo I avoided confrontation as I was flying long haul and would be alone at Changi on a layover for hours.
I sadly had to fly home with the same airline later on. On the way back hoping to avoid anymore issues I paid for a particular seat only to find that I had been reassigned a seat when at the gate. The exact same seat as before!!! I explained the issue and the Singapore Airline staff member laughed at me! Not only did they take my extra seat booking money (they refused to refund the extra seat booking cost) I was humiliated once again by their staff! I would absolutely love to see them go under! I could grumble about other airlines as none are perfect. We all expect some issue or other. I worked in Customer Service at the time so I managed my expectations. But I could never believe it would be this bad!"
Singapore Airlines,Worst Airlines Ever,1,"Worst Airlines Ever, they forced me to take a flight that it is not convenience and I tried to change it they said I have to contact the agency I booked through, plenty of back and forth between airlines and agency without any success. STAY AWAY IT'S A RIP OFF."
Singapore Airlines,hidden payments,1,after booking my tickets the singapore airlines provide info that they partner with scoot. so to book some seats we need to go scoot select and pay for the seat. this is actually stupid or you wait until the day of flight and they going to assign a random seat. now what happens to the those who have little kids do they seat randomly. ppl one seat cost is $18+.THis info is not provided anywhere when you book tickets. wow what a trick to make easy money.people be alerted to this when u book tickets with singapore airlines.
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines cancelled my flight…,1,"Singapore airlines cancelled my flight to Brisbane from Sydney in the early hours of June 22nd no alternative flight was offered just cancelled. With no other option I proceeded to book my own flight as I had arranged for my Grandson to pick me up in Brisbane at a cost to myself of AUS 262. On return to the UK I proceeded to ask for a refund. Not compensation just a refund which they refused to honour. They have offered £18 which is an insult. I’ve told them to give it to charity. I have travelled with this company many times in the past and so the treatment and good Will received from them this time is an absolute disgrace and needless to say I will not use them again , and recommend you avoid them also."
Singapore Airlines,A company that damage your luggage…,1,A company that damage your luggage (reinforced one)and say that too old not our issue don’t deserve more . If you add the price it makes it even more unbelievable
Singapore Airlines,"Exasporation, frustration, racist discrimination, and being unreasonable",1,"After the amount of exasporation I have had with SIA, I feel this review is warranted.

I am currently in Australia, on holiday, leaving tomorrow to return to UK.

While I have been here, I have gotten in to a new hobby... skirmishing... I also purchased a pair of gel blasters, a P90 SmG and a Glock G17. They are NOT REAL firearms but according to Singapore Airlines, having a hobby like this makes me a criminal and dangerous... I am unsure how, since the battery in my phone is more dangerous, and these gel blasters will be in a locked area in checked baggage.

I have an air rifle at home that is more dangerous than these things! This is perplexing, and outrageous!

They claim that they cant let me travel with them, as they are illegal in Singapore. Fair enough, but I have sought permission from the Police in Singapore, and even with that they still say no. This is just totally unreasonable, and discrimination.

I fail to see, how it is a big issue if I get permission from Singapore Police."
Singapore Airlines,I paid almost double than what Qatar or…,1,"I paid almost double than what Qatar or Emirates charge. Only to get below par service, food option very limited; eg the beef option gets finished before it gets to those at the back. I will not use them again."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines WILL NOT honour the…,1,"Singapore Airlines WILL NOT honour the included free seat when the flight is operated by a codeshare partner. I booked a return from to Singapore, operated by SWISS. The ticket, purchased via Singapore, included free seat selection. After completing the purchase, a Premium Economy ticket, I was told that Singapore takes no responsibility for seating and that I need to contact SWISS. SWISS told me that they will not provide free seat selection and that I must pay an additional fee. This is illegal and misleading behaviour from Singapore Airlines and far below expectations. I will think twice before using Singapore Airlines to book any flights in the future. Customer service was also absolutely useless and takes days to reply."
Singapore Airlines,Fantastic customer service - 5 star!,5,"We received fantastic customer service from Singapore Airlines on a flight from Singapore to Bali on the 2 July, returning on 12 July. The food was 5 star and it was nice to see the food had paper 'environmentally friendly' packaging.
It was also nice that we were able to check-in for our flight in Singapore 5 hours early, so we enjoyed the airport.
Lots of choices of in-flight entertainment and they even gave us blankets as requested.
Singapore Airlines are now my favourite airline and I have travelled with many 5 star airlines.
Lots of smiley and friendly faces at both the airport and also on board the flight.
Very easy check-in process too!"

Singapore Airlines,SIA corrected their fare,4,"3 days ago I was shocked that SIA wanted to charge £854 to change the date between Penang and Singapore for this 1 hour flight. Remarkably, SIA contacted me to apologise and I have now successfully rebooked on a most reasonable fare. Thank you SIA."
Singapore Airlines,Disappointing end to our Honeymoon,1,"We were delayed on another Singapore airline flight from Bangkok to Singapore, which caused us to miss our connection at Singapore to travel to London.

We had paid for extra legroom as a nice end to our honeymoon on the return leg, being a 13hr flight, but were downgraded to standard legroom middle seats away from each other, despite there being two seats next to each other available in a higher class which we could have been upgraded to, but Singapore airlines wanted an additional £1.7k each for the pleasure. I understand not upgrading people in general as others have paid large sums of money for the next class up, however when the only option is being downgraded from extra legroom seats next to each other, to middle seats away from each other, due to Singapore Airlines’ own delay, the outcome here did not seem fair.

We were also promised a honeymoon cake and champagne on our return leg, but this was never received."
Singapore Airlines,Good day,5,"Good day, I was on the flight from Singapore SQ324 11ty of June. I want to thank the amazing crew, Deryl, Thivesha, Yunan, Iskandar, malar and Edward for the wonderful way they gave sercive to me in BC. I had ""book a cook"" and had the lobster and it was very good! Thank you for the lovely chats, the good service and a great experience to fly Singapore Airlines!
Kind regards, Geraldine de Raadt"
Singapore Airlines,Value for money and great service again,5,"As always our trips with Singapore airlines were amazing service compared to their competitors, feel the cabin for economy are getting smaller on all airlines tbh but the service was great. Our recent flight back to NZ from Singapore was on a tired older vessel and this was evident but the service was good. We wouldn’t fly with anyone else, price and service as I say are fabulous compared to their competitors,"

We had been down graded from premium economy with a 10 month old baby and 3 year old.

We weren’t informed of this beforehand.

We were placed at the back in economy and the basinet rows were filled with only adults. These adults were then moved for other families with older children.

There were 12 business class seats completely empty at the front where our baby could cry and not bother any other passengers. We were told we couldn’t be placed in these seats.

Even when I clarified that were they to do this we wouldn’t require a refund thus saving their retention, and that we wouldn’t expect a business class service.

We only needed more space and to be away from other passengers so not to bother them.

There was absolutely no way they would be making any further revenue on these business class seats.

Downgrading without warning and failing to help a young family and baby when visibly able to do so.

So instead we sat at the back of the plane surrounded by other passengers with a crying baby and upset toddler.

Whilst 12 perfectly good seats lay empty at the front of the air craft.

How does this make sense?"
Singapore Airlines,Responded within 24 hours with all of the information,5,"I have flown Singapore Airlines a couple of times and never had a problem (that they could control anyway). Their in-flight service is excellent.
I required some information so that my carrier's loyalty program (which partner with Singapore) could credit me with loyalty points. I sent an email to Singapore Airlines general enquiries through their website yesterday, and a customer service operator called me today, verified my details and then provided everything I needed. Although it was my fault that I had not kept a copy of my paperwork, they were nothing but polite and helpful."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines is a HORRIBLE,1,"MY daughter is in SQ flight from Jakarta to London, paying an extra charge compare to other airlines, She should be flyng a direct flight from Singapore to London. However due to her SQ flight from JKT to SGP was delayed, she has to wait 7 HOURS in Singapore WITH NO ACCOMODATION provided and to fly to London the NEXT DAY using non SQ flight, INSTEAD a Eva AIR flight! And they don't compensate at all. Why we have to pay SQ airfares to fly other airlines?? What a CRAP SERVICES.

Instead of rendering apology, they offered to PAY an upgared to business class should my daughter wanted to fly the direct flight to London the next day. What a MONEY oriented service! They should directly upgrade her without paying as they made my daughter to wait for more than 24 hours for the flight. Shame on you SQ!!!! I am as the PPS Member really dissapointed with your CRAP services. PPS number: PPS CLUB

ITS A ZERO STAR services."
Singapore Airlines,Horrendous customer service,1,I went to write this review thinking my review will make no dent in a 5 star rating of this fantastic company. And turns out my 1 star review is a drop in the ocean of terrible reviews. Flight cancelled - follow up a couple of hours later rebooking us on a terrible flight option. (We are flying with 2 children and certain options of 7 am flight with another stopover are just not worth it when you are trying to have a holiday). We were offered a partial refund which we were about to take but said we would call back and after calling back 30 mins later we were told partial refund wasn’t available anymore - only full refund which we didn’t want because we wanted our flight back to stay the same. We lost a night in the hotel at this point and there was zero attempt to find a solution or make it better. Only after saying we will be speaking to a manager and an hour on hold they conceded we could keep the return flight. It might be a great airline if you are flying first class when your company is clearly overpaying for caviar and champagne but in the core it’s a crappy airline as any low cost without the low cost.
Singapore Airlines,Their Customer Service for special assistance is terrible,2,Contacted their customer service for special assistance using the online form. Really unhelpful & standard responses. I don't think they have qualified people to address these needs so why have the form?
Singapore Airlines,SIA / Kris Flyer rip off!,1,"Please explain why you rejected my mileage claim.

I flew Business Class with a Star Alliance Partner in Nov 2023 and Jan 2024 Munich to Singapore.
I submitted what I thought was a current Kris Flyer number to Turkish Airlines.
Turkish Airlines told me to claim directly with SIA
I requested a mileage claim in February 2024 to SIA and found that they had cancelled my account and didn't tell me.
I opened a new Kris Flyer Ac and requested that this be used for my mileage claim.
I have supplied all my flight documentation.
I have fulfilled all the requirements that they have requested all within 6 months.

They now have the temerity to dismiss my claim out of hand, without any explanation whatsoever or justification as to their reasoning. I have fully complied with all the terms and conditions and yet they patronise me with a gesture offer of 5000 points as an apology. I cannot be held responsible for the inadequacies of their system, they have all information I have supplied which constitutes a legitimate claim.

For eight months, I have been treated as if I am trying to defraud SIA. I have been told lies by their staff as to when I first submitted my claim which they were using to justifying the rejection of my claim. They persisted with this 6 month lie for seven months, fully knowing that it was not true. All my correspondence proves these lies.

I am tired of speaking with and communicating with the Customer Service Executive staff, sixteen of them so far and wish to have a Manager who is well above that pay grade to contact me and explain SIA's actions.

What are their reasons? If they haven't done anything wrong, then why are they apologising."
Singapore Airlines,Lost my luggage and have no clue of…,1,Lost my luggage and have no clue of where it is. No help from customer service and no empathy whatsoever. Lost all my designer clothing and trainers which cost a lot of money.
Singapore Airlines,Involuntary class downgrade and lost meal order,1,"Paid full price for an ugraded class of service for a flight with several segments to Asia because I wanted to be comfortable. I’ve only had positive experiences with SA in the past and trusted them. A couple of months before my flight, they emailed to say they are changing my plane for a 4 hour flight segment and will reimburse me for the fare difference in my now downgraded class.
It’s been 2 months, my flight has completed, and I have no reimbursement- despite spending a couple of hours on the phone with SA customer service and my Am Ex travel agent. SA said “rest assured” that Am Ex could take care of the reimbursement. This made no sense to me and Am Ex then confirmed they could not do it.
Also, during my flight, I preordered vegetarian meals and “the system didn’t receive it” on their end. My reservation showed it was confirmed, and in advance. So then 17 hours in flights with a chance of no food- and only found out while on the plane.
So frustrated. How is it legal to downgrade a class of service without a refund?"
Singapore Airlines,Beware - their promotions are scam - read the fine print carefully!!!,1,"In short:
Greedy airline that will try to rip you off. We bought two way tickets (Booking confirmation 5ATUE4) during one of their promotion periods and the hidden fine print terms of these tickets are outrageous. Our plans had changed so that we had to take an earlier flight but they insisted they will cancel our return ticket as well if we don't use the outbound ticket!!

When we complained to their customer service we were promised to be called back at 3pm the next day - but just received a short missed call at 6pm the next day (same time zone..) and no further follow up.

They used to have great customer service - very sad to see them become just another greedy airline that doesn't care about its customers and tries to make an extra dollar wherever they can.

I can understand that we should fully pay for the first non-refundable outbound flight (even if we don't take it), but it makes no logical sense (other than to make extra money) to then deny us the right to use the return flight at the later date that we already paid for in full.

Very disappointed in Singapore Airlines - used to be a great airline. After dozens of flights with SQ in the past, certainly not our choice of airline going forward."
Singapore Airlines,Terrible inflight facilities,1,"Terrible seat, bought a ticket due to the inflight entertainment and good food, but ended up with neither. SQ193 was basically a budget airplane."
Singapore Airlines,Flight from to Mumbai from Singapore,5,"Flight from to Mumbai from Singapore
The food was as good as a Michelin-star restaurant. No turbulence at all. landed 30 mins early. don't know why all the hate"
Singapore Airlines,SQ have been too desperate,1,"I would give a 0 star if possible. This SQ is getting more and more desperate. After increasing the miles for flights, service have been very poor and bad.
I booked a flight and used all miles to pay as they are expiring. After which balance is only a couple of hundreds. After I proceed to pay, a message from my bank card show I pay the full ticket amount. So I tried to contact SQ immediately but I had encountered some difficulties as I was in Korea. So I used the miles to buy my hubby ticket and I managed to speak to a customer service about an hour later. After explaining my intention to use miles to pay was not properly executed. And she advised me on how to cancel the ticket. As I intend then to use my hubby miles for my ticket later.
But I received a mail today that the cancellation fee is KRW 207000.
There is a lot of better service airlines with more competitive price and services. SQ change flight and cancel flight charges are way too ridiculous. And let alone I booked and inform to cancel within an hour."
Singapore Airlines,Pretty Good Airline,5,"Pretty good airline, good food, espacially if you are in first class and a pretty safe and comfortable flight experience. The only downsides are that the customer service takes quite long and it's pretty expensive."
Singapore Airlines,Flight Off Boarding Debarcle…,1,"We were flying from Melbourne to Dublin via Singapore and Copenhagen, the flight from Singapore was late leaving which meant we landed in Copenhagen 30 minutes before our next flight to Dublin was supposed to leave, we made it to the gate before boarding had commenced only to be told that we had been off boarded because there was not enough time for our luggage to get on this flight!! Off we go to the transfer desk get given details of new flights which is now Copenhagen to London to Dublin and 6 more hours added to what had already been a 30 hour journey, finally get to Dublin to discover that our bags are still in Copenhagen. Sheer incompetence if your going to off board passengers because there luggage won’t make it onto the flight wouldn’t you think that you would make sure that the luggage gets onto the new flights. If the is how they treat their business class passengers heaven help those in economy."
Singapore Airlines,I was going to write a bad review but…,1,I was going to write a bad review but turns out they really dont care from all tbe terrible reviews on here so I wont bother.
Singapore Airlines,Plane like a sauna,1,"Plane like a sauna , staff charging up and down the aisle disturbing passengers, food stone cold , complete lack of drinks on a long haul flight, and rude security at Singapore airport trying to steal my cake."
Singapore Airlines,The worst business class seat,2,"The worst business class seat, cannot lie horizontal like other airline business class seats, had to sleep in an uncomfortable diagonal position and this is not we paid for or expected. Don't waste your time in flying Singapore airline business class, not worth the money, fly Qatar, Emirates, JAL etc."
Singapore Airlines,"Destroyed Surfboard, rude staff, cancelled flights",1,"Went on the trip of a lifetime to the Maldives, the first time with my surfboard as it wasn't possible to rent where we went.
The way there was ""ok"" but the way back was an absolute disaster.
After a very exhausting but beautiful week, we went to the airport, only to realise that our flight was delayed. This caused me to miss my connecting flight in Singapore and instead of a two-hour layover I had to spend nine hours in Singapore, all at my own costs obviously.
After arrival my board bag looked all fine and it was super late and I was exhausted from the lay over so I went to bed only to discover the next morning that they've absolutely destroyed my only surfboard even through all the bubble wrap and special board rail covers. Which are now, destroyed as well. They did absolutely nothing online or in that useless App so I drove back to the airport. Girls, take care with the Singapore Airlines Customer Service in Bali! You might leave feeling harassed. Doesn't matter if you wear a thick sweater btw.
After two weeks of annoying back and forth, I got... nothing and had to pay for all damage by myself.
Oh and absolutely thirsty after the wait for our delayed flight from Male I got water denied by staff on the plane!! Two of my friends booked with AirAsia for half the price and everything was perfect! Where is all that money going to SA? Obviously not into giving any sh** about customers or luggage. Ridiculous."
Singapore Airlines,Food for Asian vegetarian on long floght,3,"We always like Singapore airlines Asian veg food. Last 15 years travelled many times with your airlines.
But in this flight food was not good. Bread was as hard as stone. Dahi boondi was like fine pebble vey dry and hard. Rest was ok for dinner.
For breakfast dry Masala Suji was given and I wonder anyone would eat normally water is added to make soft but either the same water dried or you chose to give dry rava. Please check your garbage bag , you will find no one eating.
Bread again very hard. Fruits were not soft.
Water in toilets were not there within 3 hrs of take off.
Comods are dirty.
Please preserve your brand.
Thanks, this is only for improvement as our Indian people take your flight for masala tea and good food. Most of the passengers I met before taking next flight to Mumbai shared the same experience.
Your hostesses are very courteous and good."
Singapore Airlines,I was sexually harassed and bullied by…,1,"I was sexually harassed and bullied by a jumped-up, narcissist Indian in a monkey suit with some kind of badge, spelt ""mamager"", as I boarded a Singapore Airlines flight. He was high on amphetamines or cocaine or something, had red, watering eyes, kept on rubbing his nose like an addict under a sick mask and was very aggressive. The CCTV would have caught it. He attacked me and pushed his body up against mine and jostled against my breasts and vagina and then ordered me around to stand here or go there after his dopey staff didn't look at my ticket or direct me properly even though I held it up for them. The dopey ticket checker just stood and looked at me quizzically, rather than doing his job of looking at tickets and directing people down the aisles, so I said the number of my seat out loudly, but not shouting. The ""Mamager"" then physically attacked me in a nasty sexual and aggressive way and told the fat pilot, who was so obese he looked like he ate the whole food trolley each flight. The aggressive, abusive Indian in a monkey suit carried on with the fat pilot for a long time and they told me to catch the next flight and ignored my request for a refund that day. He thought he was the God of all Airlines and told me I would never get to my destination. Don't ever fly Monkey Airlines!"
Singapore Airlines,Excellent,5,"Where do I begin
Singapore Airlines are simply the best airline to travel with
Their in flight service goes above and beyond nothing is to much trouble for them.
The inflight menu is excellent and the wines are very good to
Only very very slight issue was the AC was a bit cold at times
Have travelled with all the major airlines over the years and Singapore are top of the table.
When travelling to Asia will go with them
Keep up the great work getting to the top is easy but staying there is harder"
Singapore Airlines,My first time flying with them,5,"My first time flying with them, great service, nice employees, good movie choices and technology better than other airlines. Also the Flight was smooth."
Singapore Airlines,Not viable for most travellers anymore due to illegal practices,1,"Singapore Airlines used to be a decent airline, and I used to like travelling through Singapore, but their luggage policy means it's just not viable anymore. They only allow about 25kg, or 30kg on flex tickets, which if you're doing any kind of sports like Scuba diving is often not sufficient. Normally airlines offer to let you take a dive bag for this situation, or discounted sports luggage. This is especially true given they have one of the worst hand luggage allowances in the industry of 7kg when companies like KLM offer you 12kg and British airways offer you 23kg hand luggage. This really highlights how utterly unsuitable Singapore's luggage policy is for long haul as they've squeezed allowances down to the level where it's no longer possible to fly with them.

I don't even mind paying for extra luggage, but here's where the problem came in - their website said an extra 15kg would be 405 USD (£320), and as part of our flight was with Scoot that we had to phone them as we'd get a further discount on this. Upon phoning them I got an incompetent customer service rep who insisted it would be £388 each way, which is more than their advertised price, much less discounted as they advertise on the website. This is a firmly illegal bait and switch tactic that is banned by law, yet Singapore Airlines not only do this, but actively repeat it when challenged. He tried to argue the website is advisory but it's not - the price is clearly and explicitly stated with no clause about it being a pretend number or otherwise. It states that those are explicitly the costs, so for them to pretend there is a discount when in fact they charge significantly more is insane. The customer service rep wouldn't even let me speak to anyone else or their manager, so the customer service itself is abysmal, he also told me he wouldn't accept a complaint. The worst part is Scoot give you a free dive bag but Singapore Airlines itself doesn't, so they want you to pay for something that's free for part of your journey on top.

As such Singapore just isn't viable anymore for anyone wanting to take much with them other than a few clothes etc. From the UK Emirates is now a much better option, the service is much better and they have far better luggage policies. They don't lie on their website and try and rip you off, they charge you what they advertise. Go Emirates, ditch Singapore and save yourself time, money, and having to deal with incompetent staff.

Let's hope they're not also breaking any other laws, like airline safety standards if they think laws on bait and switch don't apply to them."
Singapore Airlines,I cannot up grade a flight,1,"I cannot up grade a flight. The first barrier is your staff will not accept a phone transaction. Then your internet will not accept debit cards only PayPal. Then your back up system (number 2) the debit card system does not work. What sort of back street business is this?

You system seems have all the right click and push about it but it doesn't work.

Just to complete this story, finally after 2.5 hours, which started because staff refused to upgrade my on the phone, they have finally accepted that they had to take a payment over the phone because their website does not work.

The story gets worse because then I had to book a meal on a Code Share. Their human chat-bot told me that could be done on the phone..... But no, it turns out that the Code Share company has to do it. They, being Air NewZealand did it in minutes. Why is Singapore Air so bad?

I have to admit I am completed worried about the flights now as clearly they are incompetent at everything they do."
Singapore Airlines,Travelled business class from London…,3,"Travelled business class from London Heathrow to Singapore then to Siem Reap and back to London. Seats were incredibly hard and uncomfortable. No full flat bed just a side pull out foot rest and a seat which was expected to fill the gap. Had to try and sleep diagonally during a 14 hour flight in an abnormal position. I returned home with acute sciatica costing me trips to the physio. I complained on each flight where the cabin crew were sympathetic but the design of the seats were at fault. Got little sleep resulting in extreme jet lag. Had a poor experience at Siem Reap Airport where we had no business class lounge but a cheap food voucher! Not a business class ticket experience yet Singapore Airlines believes my husband and I received money’s worth!! The attitude of staff at Singapore airport left much to be desired and one young lady thought my complaint was funny!!Since complaining in the U.K, I was dismissed and told there was no compensation due! Having read various reviews, strikes me this airline charges high but delivers low and cares little about passengers who end up with genuine problems as a direct result of its awful designed seats. I would go further to remind SA it’s captive business class audience is over age 50 and we expect comfort!! Would never recommend anyone who expects to sleep well on a long haul flight to choose SA. Ethiad and Emirates are the best."

I immediately contacted Singapore airlines for assistance. they replied with several different emails requesting documentation and pictures which i sent. I am flying back to Johannesburg tomorrow (29/05/2023) without a bag i can use for my luggage. Ive indicated the urgency to Singapore airlines but theres absolutely no regard for this. I will definitely not be flying with Singapore airlines again because of this poor service. The disregard is unbelievable. i will also be informing my company and other companies in our network to not use Singapore airlines for any of our staff going forward. I never expected this type of service from what i thought was a reputable company

And I call SQ office in Jakarta, and they give me new booking code, but same can not do check in. and the same solution, pls go to airport.
What is SQ service ???? just check in online can not do.
This is very bad airlines, simple things can not do.

Singapore Airlines,Booked on flight Puket to Brisbane…,1,"Booked on flight Phuket to Brisbane Friday 19th May 2023 and how Singapore airlines can delay the first flight meaning we miss the second flight at Singapore. Booked extra seats for length and had the nerve to rebook our seats separated from each other and not with extra leg room. No refund or common sense from Singapore airlines who don't care or offer anything back and has now been over 2 weeks. The staff are so rude and one particular female must have been that time of the month as she was extremely rude and very lucky I did not punch her in the face stupid slut. Singapore is also the most expensive airport in the world and the most disgusting airport I have ever visited.

If you are over 5.5 feet tall you will have 100% no leg room and be backed in like sardines with the food served absolute crap and not fit enough for a dog. Ask for alcohol and serve only one glass and order completely wrong, given a scotch when ordering a bourbon.

You end up paying 3 times the price to the budget airlines and service is absolute crap and when they are clearly in the wrong DO NOT give you a refund or how or when you will get your money back.

At the end of the day Singaporeans are therudes and up themselves nation going around and will never have any respect for Singaporeans based solely on this flight from Phuket to Brisbane.

Do NOT fly this airline or visit Singapore."
Singapore Airlines,Delayed flight and missing connecting flight with no apology from ground staff,1,"My flight from singapore to Sydney was delayed and as I had a connecting flight there was an attendant on arrival to pick me and take to the next flight. Initially she informed me that my luggage has not arrived but after I insisted that it can't be true, I managed to get my luggage. She then told me to take a taxi and go to the domestic airport and go to the counter and collect the boarding pass and checkin. The taxi driver took 64 AUD for the transfer and the checkin counter had a long queue. I managed to skip the queue with helpful passengers kindness and the lady at the counter says my flight is closed. I arrived in Sydney at 9.30am and the next available flight to gold coast was at 7.30pm but I had no choice but take it.
I am still waiting or a response for the following questions,
1. Why did the lady ask me to take a taxi and go by myself to domestic airport when there was a free shuttle between the airports?
2. Why didn't the lady get my boarding pass from the international airport rather than sending me to the crowded domestic airport to be humiliated by the other passengers begging them to let me cut the queue when it was clearly the responsibility of their team to sort everything as it's not my fault that the flight was delayed.
There was no apology at all ."
Singapore Airlines,Super friendly staff,5,"Super friendly staff, amazing food and comfy long haul flight! I would pay more to use this airline in the future."
Singapore Airlines,Unacceptable refund delay. The airline industry needs a consumer regulator with teeth.,1,"We booked premium economy return flights to Australia from Heathrow. We had to pay in full at the time of booking- which was months before departing.

The day before leaving we were advised that we had been downgraded in the leg from Singapore to Brisbane- because the aircraft didn't have a premium economy cabin.

They could have chosen instead to upgrade us given that it was their fault, but they chose instead to diminish the experience and downgrade us... Despite having paid an increased fare.

We have now had to wait 3 months for the differential repayment from Singapore Airlines. In reality, they have had this overpayment for the better part of a year and sold a ticket which they had no intention of fulfilling. They never fly Singapore to Brisbane with premium economy- so why are they charging the inflated fare?

When will the airline industry be subjected to genuine regulation with teeth? Until they are, they will continue to treat consumers with contempt.

The mismatch between consumers being forced to pay in full months before the service is delivered, compares badly with a 3 month delay in the refund for an unjustifiable and unacceptable overcharging.

We don't pay for a meal in advance of dining in a restaurant...

And there is little or no support for consumers when things go wrong. Sadly, our experience with international airlines is that they're all as dismissive of accountability as each other. Unless you are flying business or first you don't count. Shameful."
Singapore Airlines,Is there a score less than terrible,1,"Is there a score less than terrible? Currently traveling. Lost my bag. Was not put on my plane, it was sent to Narita and then to Montreal instead of Singapore. No updates over the past 6 days. Called customer service and lost baggage every day. Still to find someone in SIA who cares. Bag has now been in Montreal for 3 days without moving. I now enter into my second week traveling with no luggage, clothes, meds, supplies….

Find it hard to believe they were voted best airline. I have had better experiences on EasyJet. I only know where my bag is as it has an AirTag in it. SIA has no idea where it is, even with me telling them. It has not moved for 3 days….no one cares

Have asked for them just to send my bag home and I will get it there. But again no updates or action. I have asked what I can claim for my expenses….clothes luggage etc….but again they are quiet end will not confirm.

Hello

I am very angry and very unsatisfied. Stop fobbing me off with lies on this please !!

Please inform me urgently if you need any more information, as I am consulting a lawyer and talking direct to Singapore Airlines about the disgusting treatment from your staff.

Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines deliberately makes it impossible to claim compensation for delayed flights,1,"Our flight SQ351 to Bali via Singapore was canceled due to technical issues. After 5 hours of waiting in Copenhagen, we were offered to leave the next day. We were allocated taxi vouchers to and from the airport, which was perfectly fine. The next day we turned up, but were told that there was no reserved seat on the plane and that this could not be changed. We were then offered that 8 hours later, in the evening, we continued via London to Singapore and from there on to Bali. However, this meant that we were delayed by a total of 56 hours. We arrived a total of 2.5 days late at our hotel. The hotel cost USD 250 per day and was not reimbursed. However, the journey home was without problems of any kind. After the journey home, I found a form ""Disrupted flights"" to fill in regarding flight delay compensation on the Singapore AirLine website. First of all, you had to state which flight was delayed. I did but was rejected because apparently the system refused to know about SQ351??? I tried to contact SA by phone on 4 numbers. 3 did not answer and the 4th machine referred to SA's Danish branch. Here I found SA's only Danish phone number. which turned out to be a reference to lost luggage??? I tried via chatbot to get in touch with SA. Again I was guided to dead ends. It just referred to the aforementioned phone numbers. This certainly seems like SA is deliberately trying to avoid customer contact by hazzling them around to give up. I hired a company that handles these claims. They knew SA and their policy well. They stated that SA deliberately pursues that policy because it saves them millions of dollars every year."
Singapore Airlines,it appears that Singapore Airlines…,1,"it appears that Singapore Airlines slogan ""Placing you at the heart of everything we do"", only applies when you are actually travelling, any customer service does not extend to dealing with complaints regarding delays, quickly and efficiently. We were delayed 24 hours in September 2023, and are still waiting for the airline to resolve and comply with UK civial aviation rules regarding compensation."
Singapore Airlines,Krisflyer - poor customer experience,1,"This is feedback regarding Krisflyer team - I have been a loyal member of Krisflyer for over 10 years now, with many years being a Gold status member. I have personally in the past received a 3 month extension to my membership to allow a little bit of extra time to continue to maintain the Gold status. I am also aware of other colleagues and friends who were able to receive this same consideration by Krisflyer in the past to be able to maintain their status. Even though I have flights booked, and Krisflyer agent himself confirmed he couldn't quite fully calculate correctly what the miles of these flights would be, Krisflyer today have not been very customer service minded to allow once again an extension to be able to maintain the status. Whilst I appreciate there are policies, if policies have previously been ""broken"" and the agent himself confirmed he couldn't accurately determine my miles, how could they not consider? It is super disappointing to know that after many, many years of loyalty to krisflyer & star alliance group that I will now lose my gold status after many many years, especially considering Krisflyer have in the past granted extensions to members. Extremely disappointed by this inconsistency given by Krisflyer!!"
Singapore Airlines,Worst Customer Service Center/Hotline,1,"Singapore Airlines may have some of the best in-flight services and amenities but its customer service center and hotline is atrocious. I had booked my flight via one of their Star Alliance partner airline (Egypt Air) and was told by Singapore Airlines subsequently that the booking class in Egypt Air is ineligible for miles claims. After a few rounds of back and forth, Singapore Airlines said that they would process my miles claims if Egypt Air provided proof that it is eligible under Egypt Air's system. I obtained the necessary documents from Egypt Air and Singapore Airlines acknowledged this proof in July 2023 and agreed to reimburse my miles claims within 6-8 weeks. 4 months passed and my miles were still not credited and I reached out to Singapore Airlines again, and they told me that my Egypt Air booking class is not eligible for miles claims. It is as though all my efforts between May to July 2023 went down the drain. When I resurfaced Singapore Airlines previous emails promising that they would process those claims, they not only did not acknowledge it but merely pasted template answers each time they replied me. I tried to call their hotline but was put on hold for over an hour. I requested callbacks and was given specific timeslots for the callbacks but when the time came. My phone did not ring. When I emailed them to say that I did not receive any callbacks, Singapore Airlines merely said they tried but could not get through. If the agents truly tried, why didnt they immediately send an email to inform me of their effort? Instead, I have to initiate all the conversations. Once again, this is such a horrible experience that as a Singaporean that used to fly Singapore Airlines and/or Star Alliance whenever I travel, I would stop doing so. There is no benefit from being loyal to one airline and/or alliance these days when they treat their customers so atrociously. This is such a huge disappointment."
Singapore Airlines,Incredibly poor customer service team,1,"This unfortunately has been one of the worst experiences I have had with any airline, ever. Singapore Airlines consistently deliver inaccurate information to passengers, and in mine and my partners experience, point blank lied to our faces when we checked in for our flight by telling us we are permitted to skip a leg of our journey, which caused our return flight to be cancelled and leaving us stuck in Singapore. I spent 2.5 hours on the phone to Singapore Airlines customer service costing hundreds of pounds trying to resolve the issue, only to be told that the airline aren't going to do anything else for us, to rebook a new flight for 3 x the price originally paid, and hung up the phone.

When I returned to the UK my complaint was escalated to R. Bartlett in the UK complaints team, who failed to review the complaint in detail, disregarding majority of the information I provided. This airline and customer service have fallen incredibly short here and I would suggest anyone who is thinking of booking with Singapore Airlines to think again - although the service and product itself is great, the customer service leaves a lot to be desired."
Singapore Airlines,TERRIBLE SINGAPORE AIRWAYS EXPERIENCE,1,"Overall, I will not use Singapore Airlines again. Please don't be led into thinking they are a Premium Airline Company, as they do not operate as one.
On a positive, the staff on the flights were pleasant. But when confronted with a problem, not so.
We paid more thinking we would receive better service and flight than the next company, but were ill advised regards Singapore Airlines service.
Customer service, overall, very poor. Long telephone waiting times. Poor help. Actual communication poor too.
I randomly checked the seating arrangements weeks after booking. Singapore Air Line had changed our seats without notifying our family!?? Splitting our family oall over the plane! ** MY 2 YEAR OLD WAS TO SIT ON HER OWN four rows back from my partner and I?!! **
NO REFUND GIVEN FOR EXTRA LEG ROOM SEATS WE DIDN’T RECEIVE – after receiving an email stating we would receive est £50.00. Customer service to date no reply regarding. We originally paid £400.00 just for EL Seats.
When we arrived to Singapore Airport ON TIME we were told we had been reassigned to another flight. For a 2 HOUR wait for no reason with our two year old!
And there no choice of meal on return 16-hour flight.
Unfortunate for myself I had an issue with a couple on the long return flight. Staff didn’t address the issue. They let a couple use my walkway from my extra leg room seat as an area to put their luggage. I advised staff quietly as I didn’t want to fall out with these two people. Esp with my infant on board. The female staff member moved there items once and then just left them to do what they wanted. Leaving an obvious TRIP HAZARD and total blockage at times. No joke, I had to ask to leave my seat three times!! The staff member sat right in front of this Australian couple. An did nothing.
I had a duration of 13 hours back to London Heathrow enduring this !
To be brutally honest, I had ended up nearly having a panic attack twice. Not really helped by lack of sleep, child care and this stress.
I emailed the Airline and they ignored the issues and promised a £50.00 credit for seats we didn’t receive. Two weeks later and no payment.
Our family is booking a trip now to Indonesia with Qatar Airlines this week.
Please learn by others mistakes.

Singapore Airlines,Unscrupulous airline to squeeze a few dollars after receiving a few thousand extra dollars from customer,1,"I have never come across a company that would ask a customer to pay a penalty fee for switching from a cheaper to a more expensive service

I bought a one way Economy class ticket from the US to Singapore (ticket number 6182446679719/reference number 5932KI) at first, planning to take another airline for the other leg of the trip.

Being a loyal customer of Singapore Airlines, I decided to be more generous and pay a lot more to buy a 2-way Business class trip (ticket number 618-2446953857 06/reference number 54GRQ5) in place for the original one-way Economy class ticket.

I cancelled the one-way Economy class ticket after buying the 2-way Business class ticket and found to my horror that Singapore Airlines charged me a cancellation fee of US$200! I called Singapore Airlines and wrote in to ask for the US$200 cancellation fee to be waived and refunded.

The experience was a nightmare and the response was shocking to a long time customer. It took a long time to get through the hotline. My request for refund was rejected with no good reason provided.

What is the motivation behind the rejection?
- why would the airline want to squeeze a customer for a few extra dollars after being paid a few thousand US$ more by a customer to buy a more expensive service? Is this even reasonable? I like to invite any customer to comment on this point
- or does Singapire Airline not care about the customers being happy and doing what’s right for making a few extra dollars?"
Singapore Airlines,Five-Star Experience - Highly Recommended,5,"From the moment of booking to the final destination, Singapore Airlines provided a premium service that exceeded all expectations. The staff were not only professional but also remarkably honest and trustworthy, guiding me through the booking process with ease and transparency. Onboard, the experience was nothing short of exceptional. The attention to detail, comfort, and quality of service were evident in every aspect, ensuring a truly luxurious journey. It's clear why Singapore Airlines is renowned for its excellence. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a top-tier flying experience."
Singapore Airlines,I am writing to share my appalling…,1,"I am writing to share my appalling experience onboard your company's aircraft on Tuesday, 9 July. I requested mobility support (wheelchair service) due to a fractured foot and DVT. The customer service agent at the Bangkok airport for Singapore Airlines was very attentive, supporting my request for assistance to the gate and booking a wheelchair service from Singapore Airport to Immigration. However, not even five minutes after boarding the aircraft, a flight attendant named Nicole Ng approached me and questioned whether I was seated in the correct seat.

I explained that I was in the correct seat and had paid for the upgrade due to my fractured foot and large medical boot. She then told me that a couple was seated in my seat and would not want to be separated, and insisted on seeing my ticket. I showed her the ticket and reiterated that I had paid for the seat. It is a three-seat row, and I was unsure why a couple would complain about the seating arrangement. I was the first person seated and had not been approached by anyone to switch seats.

Not ten minutes later, two passengers sat in the same row. They arrived at different times, and I asked both if they were a couple wanting to sit together. Both passengers were strangers and were unaware of the flight attendant's so-called concerns. Nicole Ng came to the row several times but never approached either passenger nor requested to review their tickets. Her behavior was rude and created a very uncomfortable experience onboard the aircraft. She was also our flight attendant for service and rudely handed me a drink. I have never encountered such behaviour on a Singapore aircraft.

Singapore Airlines has a reputation for being a professional airline carrier. However, your flight attendant's unprofessional behaviour and poor customer service was beyond disappointing. Additionally, I inquired about a wheelchair picking me up at the gate, and the attendant promised to get more information by the end of the flight. No one followed up, and a wheelchair was not waiting for me at the gate. It was a nightmare experience for someone with my physical challenges."

Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines is dishonest,1,"I flew on SQ217 from Singapore to Melbourne on the 4th of January. My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldn’t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don’t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane’s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. You can’t trust an airline company that lies like this. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher. But they replied saying they can only give me a voucher to be used for my future bookings through Singapore airlines. I refused to accept it because I will not fly with them in the future. Even a budget airline would have been more comfortable than this flight. But the greatest worry is their dishonesty."
Singapore Airlines,Superior Business Class Enperience,5,"Wonderful Business Class experience. Friendly, attentive flight staff, comfortable and spacious lie-down seats.
So much better than our disappointing experience of BA coffin like Business class experience."
Singapore Airlines,My recent flight with Singapore…,5,"My recent flight with Singapore Airlines was truly outstanding. From the smooth check-in process to the comfortable and well-maintained cabin, every aspect of the journey was exceptional. The in-flight entertainment options were extensive, and the meals were delicious and well-presented.

A special thank you to Nur Atisah, whose remarkable service and warm demeanor made the flight even more enjoyable. Her attentiveness and care exemplify the high standards of Singapore Airlines and significantly enhanced my travel experience.

Overall, Singapore Airlines delivers a superior flying experience, and I highly recommend them for anyone seeking comfort and exceptional service."
Singapore Airlines,Horrible Customer Support,1,"Flying back from Australia to the UK and my 2 year old daughter got moved seats so that me, my partner and daughter were no longer all sitting together. When we went to check in, i queried how a 2 year old was supposed to sit by themselves and they said there was nothing they could do about it because the flight was full and said ""She was probably moved to accommodate a child"" SHES 2!!
Lucking both adult seats were still sat together so after asking the check in desk, help desk and boarding gate with no one doing anything or even caring we just swapped seats so that my daughter was sat with my partner and i was sat alone.

After this, due to the stress of departing the airline with a young child and carrying all the bags, i had accidentally left my iPad on the plane. I realized 30 minutes after deboarding when about to board the 2nd leg of the flight. I instantly flagged this to the boarding gate and they said they would put out a message and get someone to board the plane and get it for me but that it may not get back to me in time for the next flight but assured me it would go on the next flight to the UK and get posted back to me. I also informed the lost baggage staff in the UK who then told me to go back to the check in desk and tell them. So i did. The check in desk then said it wasnt for them to deal with and to go to the tickets desk. Luckily, a manager overheard this convocation and asked me to write down all the information (e.g what flight, seat and item description) and said they would get in touch with the Singapore team of Singapore airlines (as they were the London team) and get it posted back to me. After arriving home, i also filled out an online lost baggage report. A couple of days later i got informed that my iPad could not be found and there was nothing i could do about it (Informed by the online baggage report through SATS Baggage) and have still not been contacted by the Singapore or London team with whom i spoke.
I know its not the airline or staff fault that i left my ipad on the plane but at evert stage of the process the staff have been incredibly unhelpful in trying to recover my device. This cannot be a rare occurrence for people to leave things on a plane so how is it so hard to get anything back?!

Paid over £3000 for return flights to Australia for my family and will never fly with them again after the way we have been treated."
Singapore Airlines,SQ305,5,"Before we took off, the crew handed out hot towels to passengers in economy. Yes, hot towels!! This was top notch from Singapore Airlines, and out of all the many times I have flown the LHR to SIN route, this was the only flight service where I was given a hot towel.

The meal service was ok, but not the best I have had from Singapore Airlines. For the first course after takeoff, the crew served breakfast. I had the Indonesian Style Chicken Noodles, and there was another option of a Mushroom Crepe with Herb Sauce. This tasted good, but not as well as I hoped. Drinks were also available onboard, and I opted for a Sprite. Usually, some airlines only give you a cup of sprite, but on Singapore Airlines, they served me a whole can. I’m not sure how many other airlines does this, but this definitely put Singapore Airlines above market.

There were also snacks in the galley. There were various snacks available, from chocolate bars to crisps. On another note, the toilet was clean and tidy, and there were facial towels, as well as soap and paper towels to dry your hands.

Unfortunately, supper was not good for me. I had the fish fillet, whilst the other option was chicken rice. This may have been my tastebuds, but nonotherless, I didn’t like it. The starter, which was a shrimp salad was very good, and I thoroughly enjoyed eating it. For desert, we were given a chocolate brownie pot. This tasted very good, with a rich creamy layer on the top, and a cake like layer on the bottom.

There were a range of amenities provided on this flight, such as blankets, pillows, eyeshades, toothbrushes and toothpaste. These were very handy in freshening up after a long 13 hour flight.

The 11.1 inch IFE screen was highly responsive, and came with a touchscreen remote. There was a map that showed where we were, and information about our destination and what time we were going to arrive. There were many entertainment options that kept you occupied for the long 13hrs, from latest movies to new releases music playlists. In addition to this, there was the standard cup holder, charging ports and table, however unlike any other airline, it came with a mirror. This was very convenient for me, as it would have been for many other passengers onboard.

Overall, I am pleased to say that I had a very pleasant experience onboard Singapore Airlines flight SQ305, and am looking forward to flying with them again

Singapore Airlines,Connection between the 2 flights was…,1,"Connection between the 2 flights was very short, plus the first flight was a bit late, as I was worried the luggage couldn’t make it, I asked at the gate before boarding the second flight and they confirmed that the luggage would be sent the next day, I have been told that I could either take the flight and wait for the luggage to arrive next day or stay there and take the flight the next day. They said that no compensation was offer for either paying the hotel to stay there an extra night, or to buy a change of cloths for next day, not really happy about it as it’s absurd that I need to spend more money for the airline inefficiency, plus one of the girls on the counter, different than the one I was talking, she intervened and she was very rude telling me if I wanted to get the flight or not with a tone that made it sound like an ultimatum. You shouldn’t offer a flight with such a short layover if you are unable to handle luggages and definitely shouldn’t hire persons like the one on the counter.
Also the plane wasn't that comfy, there is much better companies."
Singapore Airlines,I am writing this complaint as i feel their official responce are nothing but bureaucratic loops,1,"I am writing this complaint as i feel SQ has initiated the ignore and bureaucratic loop strategy in the hope i give up and accept their mistake as fate. Well let me tell everyone i intent to spread the words be it in this site or elsewhere.

So here is my story:::::

On the 19th of October 2023 my wife was travelling from Brunei to Dubai through Singapore using the SQ all the way.

Unfortunately due to the lateness of the SQ flight arriving from Singapore meant that her departure to singapore was also delayed and it also meant that her arrival into singapore was also delayed.

This made her miss her SQ connecting flight.

Fortunately the SQ ground staff were helpful in getting her on the Emirates flight later that evening which meant that she has more than 5 hours to roam around changi airport.

As i am a SQ solitaire card holder my wife is a supplementary solitaire card holder.

So when my wife asked if she could use the SQ lounges to rest her feets as she suffers from knee pains even after a recent corrective surgery in view she was a supplementary solitaire card holder and that she was travelling on SQ flights from Brunei and the missed flight to Dubai.

All be it the case, when she approached the ground staff on this they told her. FLAT NO.
She didnt even get any meal voucher for tea or dinner as her emirates connecting flight was in the evening.

So I sent an email on the same day enquiring SQ on the eligibility of solitaire supplementary card holders use of the kris lounges in singapore or anywhere its available.

I also asked

1. Have the policy changed for pps club members that a solitaire or a solitaire supplementary member cannot use kris lounges when arriving on SQ flights and is ONLY allowed if departing on SQ flights.

2. While it is much appreciated that SQ got her on the emirates flight the delay was as a result of the late arrival of the SQ flight. And as a solitaire supplementary member could that have not been considered to allow for the use of the lounge even though her connecting flight is no longer SQ.

So far aside from the emails that stated

“ We have escalated your inquiry to the relevant team since our last reply and deeply apologize for the delay in response.

Your inquiry has been expedited at the time of writing and one of our representatives will be in contact with you the soonest.

We highly appreciate your patience in this matter.”

Nothing but nothing concrete has been given and now its already christmas day More than 2 months have passed by.

I will now also initiate to tell this story on any possible online platform to inform everyone how SQ actually dont care about its passengers but more its profit"
Singapore Airlines,Worst experience / Hotline,1,"My father, who is aged 62, embarked on a journey from Adelaide to Ahmedabad today, on 14/11/2023. However, he encountered an unfortunate situation where he was provided with only one boarding pass from Adelaide to Singapore due to ""technical issues"" as explained by the Singapore airport staff.
This unexpected circumstance has caused considerable distress to my father, as he perceives it as a lamentable level of service offered by the airport staff. Regrettably, no contact numbers were found online to establish communication with the Singapore airline and discuss this troubling situation.

We would appreciate it if the relevant authorities or airline representatives could address this matter professionally and provide us with a solution or explanation regarding the incident. It is important to ensure the smoothness and comfort of passengers' journeys, as such unfortunate experiences can mar the overall travel experience."

Singapore Airlines,"Avoid if possible, in particular in business class. Very disappointing, not what it used to be, not up to their responsibility in case of problem",1,"Out of 4 recent business class flights between Europe and Australia I had problems with two, which made the journeys very uncomfortable and troublesome, and created other problems. They inappropriately dealt with both of them, according to me, on top of telling me things that turned out to be wrong, further showing unreliability of their claims.
In one case, my expensive “business-class” seat had no electric power at all, for a 12-hour flight (out of a 24-hour total flying trip with them) ; This, even though they knew it before the flight. So, no electric command was working: The electronic commands of the seat, so that I could not move the seat nor adjust its position or shape ; The headlights were also not working (so no real light when cabin lights were off) nor was the call button, so I could not even call the staff for any kind of assistance, but had to go and see them to ask for anything. This for 12-hours …
For this they offered a voucher of 200 Singapore$ (147 US$, 136 €) limited to purchase in their gift shop … Singapore Airline staff in two different locations, told me things that turned out to be false, resulting also in waste of time: That their customer service would contact me for this ; they didn’t. Then (the sales people, basically the only ones that I managed to call) that if I wrote, via their website (essentially the only real way to contact the customer service, since other claimed options didn’t work in practice and so were just a source of further waste of time), Singapore would answer “within 72 hours, maximum” ; They did after 1 month ... (perhaps thanks to a reminder I sent 12 days later). And this didn’t turn out to be very constructive either.
This case shows how little they value customer’s comfort in business class (in spite of advertising the opposite) and customers' time. So does the 2nd case: we missed the connection between 2 SA flights, in Singapore, due to late 1st flight, but no assistance from SA, eg to reorganize our arrival, (resulting in waste of time and money). Except for having automatically rebooked us on a future flight, even though we could have just made it for the initially planned connecting flight, particularly since flying business class: we could have arrived at the departing plane 8 minutes before its closing door time ; I told the ground staff but they refused.
I asked whether European law (or similar Singapore law) would apply ; After 1.5 months they told me they are still reviewing the question ..."
Singapore Airlines,How is this a top rated airline?,1,"We
have travelled with Singapore airlines a few times before prior to lockdown and they were very good. This was a very special trip for my family and I but this time the airline was terrible and I am not
normally someone who complains. This airline is supposed to be ranked in the top 10 in the world and in some lists they are ranked number 1 I do not know how this could possibly be it was terrible there is no leg room we have had more leg room on Ryanair only this flight was 13 hours I am not tall 5ft 9in and not fat I have a bit of a tummy but had to breath in to put the meal tray down.The food was horrible and tasted of the containers they came in. They offered no eye mask earplugs and more important deep-vein thrombosis socks which we have always got on long haul flights prior to lockdown.
On the outward journey the check in was good and the crew were very nice. The return trip was appalling again the food was terrible. On the manage my booking page it showed the meals and supposedly we had the option to opt for a vegetarian option but it was not available to us and said we could change it on board however the dinner course was fish or
chicken I am allergic to fish so chose chicken they were only about 20 rows into the economy section but we were told there was no more chicken
I told them of my allergy they said they would get me something else.
This was a night flight we were 4 row from the front of our section by the time they got to the front they started to collect the trays even when people were still eating as was my wife so they tried to take the
bits that had been used I tried to get the girls attention to ask about my alternative meal but she went straight by at which time I gave it up
ate my wife's roll and tried to sleep the crew clearly wanted to finish the meals turn the lights off and retire to the back of the plane as to do what ever they do there the next we saw of them until breakfast the
choices there was scrambled eggs or chicken porridge I do not eat eggs and do not know what the other thing is so declined I was asked if I wanted the vegetarian option I said yes the tray the lady pulled out was the same tray with the main course removed at this point I had enough complained at what they had done she asked me would I like a chicken wrap I said yes please then a male member of the crew came to mewith 2 different sandwiches one supposed to be beef and I have no idea what was in the other I said I had been promised a chicken wrap (there suggestion) to be told they had no chicken wraps I then told them sarcastically I would leave it as I had eaten 2 rolls during the flight so was full
Fully frustrated I put on my mask to sleep whilst this
happened a member of the crew approached my wife to offer me a packet of crisps
I am so frustrated that I intend to write direct to the CEO of Singapore airlines but in truth I expect no reply as I was a economy ticketed customer and I think they only pander to Business and 1st Class
passengers but I will give him the benefit of the doubt until that time as I am sure there are big business men who care about their small man and women customers so please be aware before paying this airlines over inflated prices would be my opinion"
Singapore Airlines,The refund that disappeared,1,"We need help in getting our preapproved refund from Singapore Airlines of the amount of US 14, 508.30
On September 24, 2023, we made reservations through the Singapore Airlines website for two tickets to Singapore for myself and my wife, paying via PayPal in the amount of 14,508.30 USD, that is, two tickets at 7,254.14 USD each (SQ 21 New York to Singapore, December 19, 2023, and SQ 22 Singapore to New York, January 24, 2024, with the booking reference 5AFPCN.
Unfortunately, since I was diagnosed with a double hernia and scheduled for surgery on 28 December, we had to cancel our flights and file our request, with documentation, for a refund (10/03/2023). Our request for a refund was granted, with my refunded ticket bearing the designation 6182446682751, and my wife’s the designation 6182446682750. We received an email from Singapore Airlines on October 4, 2023, indicating that the tickets had been refunded through our Paypal account, with the Transaction ID 7PV23098EY7515027.
However, we did not receive any refund at that time, nor have we received any sum since then. On October 19, we called the Singapore Travel Office at 1-833-7270118, and an individual who called himself “Daniel” indicated that he could find no record of our transactions but asked us to submit screen shots of the email, which we did. Several hours later, an individual who called himself “Ryan” and claimed to be “Daniel’s” manager, upon being sent other screen shots of the transactions, told us that Paypal had rejected the transaction because of the high amount. He told us that he would try to find a way to refund us our money.
We soon received an account verification email from MOONPAY, and “Ryan” asked us to read him that number, which we did. He said he would keep working on our case and would contact us (10/20/23) with a solution. Upon investigation, we discovered that MOONPAY is a pay site associated with cryptocurrency investing, at which point we concluded that we were the victims of some sort of scam organized by the SIA-USA employees.
We called every available telephone number belonging to Singapore Airlines-USA, asking to talk to a manager who would look into this matter with us, but employees such as one who called herself “Lisa Garcia” told us that her manager was out of the office and invited us to call other Singapore numbers for help. And so on.
We filed a complaint through Paypal to request some answers and refund (10/26/2023), submitted all the documentation and to this day, Singapore Airlines which had been contacted by Paypal has not responded. Paypal on 11/20 informed us that SIA-USA has refused to respond.
We also went through Better Business Bureau on 11/06/23, submitted all the paperwork, and still no response.
SIA-USA was contacted 3 times (Paypal, BBB, GetHuman) and still refused to respond. Why?

Please could you advocate for us and communicate with Singapore Airlines about their lax security structures which allowed “employees” to divert refunds for illegal purposes.
Thank you in advance for your help."

To our disappointment the Singapore aireline, customer service unable to proceed with the open ticket with all their excuses like u are flying from Penang and now they will not be able to board us in even if we top up to purchase Penang to singapore on a separate purchase.

After a lengthy flight delay my family missed our connecting transport and were told to book new transport and submit the receipt to an email address they provided me. There was an ensuing 6 months of ridiculous back and forth emails and I had to send the receipt through three separate times. Final result, they refused to reimburse. What a joke. I wish I could contact the original staff who gave me the instructions of making the booking and submitting the receipt. I suspect they were completely genuine in telling me I'd be reimbursed. Extremely poor customer service from Singaoore Air"
Singapore Airlines,Refunds not received from 2020 until…,1,Refunds not received from 2020 until now. I’m so disappointed with Singapore Airlines. Some contact centre agents are very rude. I need my money and compensation to what you putting me through.I am tired of your promises Singapore airlines is a liar!

Singapore Airlines,Worthless airmiles. Your loyalty will be punished!,1,"I’ve been a loyal customer for years and as a result accumulated a lot of airmiles. SQ have now made it impossible for me to use my miles. I have 183k miles and it won’t even get me 25% off my booking. You’ve changed the value of miles so significantly that they are almost worthless now.
I used to be able to get so much more from my miles as a reward for my loyalty. And now hardly anything.

There are plenty of other airlines to use! That’s where my money has been going since you started punishing your loyal customers!"
Singapore Airlines,I flew several flights in business…,5,"I flew several flights in business class and all were of a high standard. Unfortunately, hot towels and amenity kit were no longer served, otherwise everything else was great."
Singapore Airlines,The half star singapore airlines,3,I like their first class of A380 and their cabin crew. But their food and toilet not so delicious and clean.
Singapore Airlines,Business class BNE KUL,3,"I decided to change my preference from Qantas to Singapore airlines following my disappointment in quality of service during my very recent journey. I remember having greatest experience onboard SINGAPORE airlines during the past trips.
I did receive a very caring service onboard but the total lack of communication with ANYONE prior to the departure was astonishing! ?
First of all, it is almost impossible to find their contact details little well hearing from their customers service operators. Numerous emails, phone calls gave zero results.
I felt as if I stepped into the past rather than future.

It could have been a 5* review if the airlines improved their on ground operations.

Great in the sky hopeless on ground."
Singapore Airlines,Simply the best in any class,5,Simply the best in any class. Unfortunately quite expensive sometimes.
Singapore Airlines,Aweful customer services and website…,1,"Aweful customer services and website and mobile app fares not updated, what is shown on website and mobile app are not the same fare as per customer services. And their customer service is aweful!!! Furthermore, the economy seats in DXB-SIN and SIN-DXB flight is so smalll and the food taste like hospital food. Never flying with Singapore Airlines again and i will make sure none of my family and friends ever will."
Singapore Airlines,Changed Flight Without Proper Notice,1,"They changed my flight without proper notification. And then when I asked them for any possible solutions they were extremely rude. They refused to take any responsibility and were just horrible to deal with. I even asked to speak to a supervisor and the guy simply said there is no one else to talk to. They will send an email to your spam folder, tell you that you didn't see it and it isn't their problem. Horrible company will never deal with them again."
Singapore Airlines,Writing on behalf of my mother,1,"Writing on behalf of my mother. Extremely poor communication service.
My parents booked flights to Thailand through your airline. Had to postpone due to covid, and paid extra for the privilege. Postponed again with offer of refund. Never recieved. My father has since passed away and now mum has on multiple occasions through a variety of means tried to get in contact to try and follow up the refund, wantng to rebook for herself and another family member to hold a memorial service on the 1st anniversary of his death with friends in Thailand with no response help or even acknowledgement. $2307 outstanding plus the extra $539 when rebooking, plus $129 for seat selection. This is extremely rude and poor customer service. Mum is dads sole beneficiary and is entitled to receive this service, but to date has had no response."
Singapore Airlines,My best flight,5,"The BIGGEST thank you to the crew of SQ 26 from Singapore to Frankfurt on Apr 21st, attending me on upper deck Business Class. I felt that they were not only doing their job but that they also enjoyed doing it. Top service, a natural smile and so professional. I already wrote this to the airline too. Anddy Chow, Raymond Than, Ryan Chua, Addison Pang, Jieling, Rachel and Karren: THANK YOU! Safe travels in the future."
Singapore Airlines,So so,2,"Just flew Sydney to
London with them and clearly cutbacks compared to pre covid. It was mediocre and better to fly cheaper airline in future."
Singapore Airlines,Wouldn't recommend Singapore Airlines…,1,"Wouldn't recommend Singapore Airlines to anyone. We travelled to get married in Australia. Most of our trip and stay was lost on worrying and picking everyone from airports on different times. Family members split into different and longer flights, with long stopovers. With all our flights booked no even once anyone congratulated us on special occasion. Neither offer a simple treat to make us feel special. Lack of empathy from customer service due to long complain. Only suggestion given, that they will learn from. This is not good enough for all we have gone through with them. Please think twice if you wish to book a special journey with them."
Singapore Airlines,Gesture of Goodwill,5,"I rated Singapore Airlines poor recently because of my unfortunate experience with them when I was travelling back to Manchester, UK. After I sent my complaint to their customer service team, I received a feedback that they will credit £145.00 back to my account as a gesture of goodwill to compensate the 5kgs charge of my baggage. I was not expecting this refund when I made the complaint however, I am very grateful that you honour my case no. when I chatted your representative via online about the baggage matter. Thank you so much."
Singapore Airlines,Our Recent Experience on SQ34,5,"I along with my wife travelled by SQ34 on 15th April 2023 between Singapore and Sanfrancisco in Business class. Our experience has been awesome. Crew were very freindly and service was excellent. Our crew members:
Inflight Manager EDDY

Flight stewardess : RADHIKA
They did a commendable job and our Compliments and Best wihshes to them.

Singapore Airlines,"Endless flight changes, poor service and zero compensation",2,"Booked a family trip from Uk to Australia via Singapore, Premium Economy, almost a year in advance. Chose the flights due to time of flights, length of stopover and price.
Prior to flying, the airline changed the flights on 7 different occasions. Changes were substantial meaning we had to completely change our holiday plans which incurred a lot of costs, cancelling and rebooking hotels (obviously the airline said it wasn’t their problem) We lost the capacity to sit together, as flights were changed once everyone else had booked seats. We were also booked onto ridiculous alternative flights with stupid transfer times which were always going to be unattainable. On each occasion I spoke to the airline, they were unapologetic and had a general attitude that I should be grateful they were helping me at all.
Unsurprisingly the flights didn’t work and we missed connections. The airline was again unapologetic ( they say the word sorry but do nothing). We were bumped onto economy flights and told they didn’t give compensation. On the economy flights we were seated next to the toilets and there wasn’t enough food to give us a meal. Again we were told they don’t give compensation.
I flew Singapore 20 years ago and it was great. It’s a very different airline these days and is purely living off its past reputation. Won’t use them again."
Singapore Airlines,Horrible customer service and experience,1,"First and foremost horrible customer service. I have been trying to reach them over 3 months to receive compensation for delayed baggages, without any response or luck. Additionally, they have sold their ""Scoot"" (their low cost airline) flight on Singapore Airline prices which was disastrous! +4 hours delays, no charger or entertainment, minimal food 1 time served over an 8 hours direct flight (Singapore, Melbourne). I used to have high regards to the airlines, but no more."
Singapore Airlines,What happened to the hot towels when…,1,"What happened to the hot towels when you first arrived onboard, what happened to the hostess bring water and juice several times during a 12 hr flight, jeez what happened to the meals?? I now know why that daft american with the baseball cap in the news was saying ""give me water, give me water"" a few months back.
No longer the best by a country mile, now on par with british airways! All the ME airlines have now over taken singapore airlines in standards.
Shocking down grade since covid!!"
Singapore Airlines,Simply breathtakingly bad service that is inexcusable and indefensible.,1,"I've been flying with Singapore Airlines since I was 18 years of age and I am now 64. My husband and I are Elite Gold Members.

I have always had only the best things to say about Singapore Airlines over the years, however, their standard of service, food, etc. etc. etc. is slipping and it is just not good enough.

Firstly, Singapore Airlines needs to understand that people book flight times that suit THEIR NEEDS and THEIR COMMITTMENTS.

My husband and I recently holidayed in Singapore and Singapore Airlines in their wisdom changed BOTH of our flights TWICE.

We were originally booked on SQ 226 on 2nd March ’23 Perth to Singapore departing at 14:10 and returning home on SQ229 8th March ’23 Singapore to Perth departing at 12:30 and they cancelled both flights. So, it was back to the drawing board to select NEW DATES.

Our new flights we were booked to fly out on Sunday 26th March @ 14:05 and Singapore Airlines rescheduled our flight to leave at 06:25 in the morning! We had to get up at 2am in the morning – not fun.

We were due to come home on a 12:20 flight to Perth on Saturday 1st April. However, the airline in its wisdom decided to change our flight to depart @ 18:45 As a result of this change, my husband and I had to pay 1/2 day’s accommodation to cater for a later check-out. Half a day was approximately 300 AUD.

There was a storm in Singapore on the day of our departure and my husband and I watched it in coming in from the Lounge at the Airport. Heavy rain is plentiful in Singapore and something they are used to.

Our plane was delayed BY AN hour and a half due to the storm. I have no issue with that as it was the 'safe' thing to do.

Anyway, we eventually arrived home at 2am on the 2nd April to find that our suitcases were saturated all the way through. Every piece of clothing etc. was soaking wet. Many pieces ruined. Clearly, someone hadn't bothered to shelter the flights luggage from the storm.

My husband contacted Singapore Airlines via email the next day and lodged a complaint. He also sent a follow up email last week.

It's hard to believe, but to date (16th April), we have not heard back from Singapore Airlines, let alone received an apology.

Simply breathtakingly bad service that is inexcusable and indefensible."
Singapore Airlines,Don’t respond adequately to customer complaints around delays and lost baggage.,1,"Had delays on flight, check in and lost baggage. When making complaint have been stonewalled with a lack of response. Really disgusted by the customer sevice what is meant to be a highly rated airline. Does nkt make me want to fly with them again or recommend to anyone else."
Singapore Airlines,They won't honor their promises to customers,1,"I was looking to earn 1,800 elite miles to qualify for Silver status (status doesn't mean that much to me, but it gets you further up the waitlist when redeeming miles for flights, which I do care about). I contacted their customer reps prior to booking on a partner flight since I don't live in Asia and was told I would earn elite miles on this partner airline. After I flew, I saw regular miles accrue, but nothing credited to my elite miles balance. I contacted their customer service, who told me they would fix this but it would take 2 weeks. I contacted them after those 2 weeks and was told they would address it, but they would need at least another 4 weeks. It's been about a month so I followed up and am now being told I won't be able to get those miles credited.

I'm so incredibly angry about the fact that I booked a flight to earn this nominal amount of miles--and had confirmed I'd earn elite miles with them--only to be told I was given misinformation by them THREE times--and that they won't resolve this for me. I've flown with them quite a lot this past year and have an insane amount of frequent flier miles with them and am shocked at how poorly they're handling this."
Singapore Airlines,"I was sneakily downgraded, nobody cares",1,"I had an 8 hour flight booked on an A380 which offers their FULL business class product, and was downgraded to an A350 with their REGIONAL product, which is usually used for their shorter (2-4 hour ish) routes. What annoys me most is that I wasn't even told about it and thus wasn't even offered the chance to rebook. The cabin crew were great, but I didn't get what I paid for - after countless emails and escalations (their customer service centre agents are appallingly bad - I've had better luck with bots), I still can't find anyone who cares. Book with them at your own risk."
Singapore Airlines,Takes no responsibility of their own…,1,"Takes no responsibility of their own mistakes.
We bought a 600 USD baby stroller matching the guidelines from Singapore Airlines, meaning that we were allowed to bring it to the gate and store it in the overhead compartment.
Everything went well until our return flight when all the overhead compartments were full, meaning that we were forced to leave it at outside the plane.
When we got it back it was completely trashed and Singapore Airlines took no responsibility at all. Even mixing up their own rules to avoid compensation.
Flight crew is nice, but I would avoid as long as they dont tale any responsibility at all."
Singapore Airlines,What Water Are We Drinking?,2,"On a long haul flight from Singapore to London, there was no bottled water. Usually, an airline has bottles at the back where you can help yourself. I have been emailing and emailing but no-one will tell me - firstly, what happens to all the plastic cups. Surely that amount of plastic waste should be illegal in 2023? And secondly, what water are we drinking? They told me it was ""tap water"" but what does that mean? What tap are they getting it out of?? I have never been on a flight before where there was such inadequate access to water."
Singapore Airlines,Terrible Customer Service,1,"Singapore airlines single handily made our honeymoon an absolute nightmare.
We were heading to Thailand and Bali for our 2 week honeymoon. THE DAY OF our flight out to Thailand, they cancelled our connecting flight from Singapore to Bangkok (after we had upgraded our flights from premium economy to Business) and we spent THREE HOURS on the phone until they were able to finally fix it and find us a connecting flight (which they told us didn’t exist, but magically it appeared after fighting with the customer service rep).

Then, on our returning flight, we had received an email about upgrading our flight again to business class and the email clearly specified that we would be upgrading both legs of our flight. After paying to upgrade, only one leg of our flight was upgraded. Mind you, it was the 2 hour flight and not the 18hr flight back to NY. Upon realizing only one leg was upgraded, we immediately called customer service to have the issue fixed. Because it was late at night, the woman on the phone promised me she would have a supervisor contact me the next day. After not receiving a call back, I called back and spent another 2 hours on the phone and after talking to FOUR people was told that they would be able to fix the issue at the ticket counter once we checked in for our boarding pass.

Not only was that not true, but then I had to speak with multiple people at the counter as well as call customer service back AGAIN only to be told they could do nothing and the “matter would be escalated”.

Not only do they false advertise, but they outright lie to customers just to get them off the phone and their customer service could care less about their actual clients.
We will NEVER be flying with Singapore airlines again and will be filing a report with the better business bureau as well as consumer affairs. Terrible business practice."

It's now April 8th and they still have not reimbursed me for the items they lost. Also, all they ever say to me when I call, is that they are looking into it. NEVER FLY SINGAPORE AIRLINES THEY WILL LOSE YOUR STUFF AND NEVER REIMBURSE YOU!"
Singapore Airlines,Got ticket on Singapore airlines using my Alaska airlines…,1,"Got a ticket using my Alaska airlines miles . Singapore airlines is one of the milage partners.Got a good deal for a flight from Manila to lax using my miles. Then Singapore airlines started double charging for seat assignments ,the triple charging for seat assignment. then only locking in half the seats ,then charging again for the seat I just payed twice for .If you call them get ready to be upsold and double talked and offer an up grade for the balance of you Alaska miles plus $4500. Wow .Called Alaska airlines card membership and the manager advised me....Dont argue with Singapore airlines or the might leave me stranded 6000 miles away from home. We will work with you on all these extortion charges once you get back.wow. Great partners!!Oh just got another mystery charge from Singapore airlines. The US Dept of transportation should have a field day with this outfit."
Singapore Airlines,Food on flights is very average,1,"Food on flights is very average. Seating is too close when seats in front of you are reclined; making the viewing screen straining to the eyes. Surely this is in breach of health and safety. Damaged luggage. 3 wheels missing from my suitcase. In-flight movies are mainly old. I reported damage at the airport. The DPR baggage damage report was incorrectly filled out by SIA staff. No file reference number was written on the form and so I cannot follow up.. It was left blank. I was told I would be emailed within 48 hours and more than 1 week later have received nothing. Additionally, I emailed MNL_baggage and received no reply."

Singapore Airlines,Took a flight from Singapore to London…,5,Took a flight from Singapore to London and it was a pleasure all the way through the journey - well done guys keep up the good work!
Singapore Airlines,Our last flight with them was a disaster,1,"Our last flight in Frankfurt with them was a complete disaster. It started with their checkin crew, The crew were pretending to be working but really not working. There were open counters but only one is working and we had to get inline to get serviced. It felt like checking in with a really bad budget airlines. Because of this we got delayed in going to immigration. There were no last call made by the ground crew. We heard nothing. When we got to the boarding gate, we were denied boarding by their ground staff because they said we were 4 mins late.and they wouldnt want to open the gate for us as well. We were even scolded when we begged to be boarded as the plane was still in the boarding gate. But the rude staff that was just really RUDE! were happy to offload us instead which took longer if they were to let us board the plane. The plane stayed in the boarding gate for 1 hour since we arrived the boarding gate. We have asked the staff who is in-charged and who can help us for rebooking our flight. Their cold answer was they are incharge and they cannot help us. The staff just continued chitchatting or pretending to be working. The bad experience never end because they also didnt offload all of our baggage. It took 4 days for our bag to get to our hotel. We didnt receive any receipt that they have delivered our bag as well. We rebooked our flight ourselves and paid the expensive new ticket. The second supposed to be flight, we had to deplane due to technical issue. We had to go to the airport 3x just to take the same route. When we complained to the helpdesk about the whole experience, it took them 3 months to “investigate” just to come up with a big lie of reason. Their insurance that they sell along with their ticket is also not of help. I would never recommend nor will i buy it again for myself. Overall experience, it was so traumatic that I am blocking them for all my future travels. I highly do not recommend."
Singapore Airlines,No stars deserved!!!,1,"No stars deserved!!!
We had return flights with Singapore Airlines to Phuket in Thailand. Their service was vile.
Our krisflyer details were given when booking but system would not recognise as correct during online check-in. Therefore unable to earn points, use previous points and unable to access full inflight services so spent half of every flight without inflight entertainment.

Booked a SQ coded flight to return but were put onto scoot flight for return from Singapore. Got a meal (it was small, one choice & a can of coke) and a rubbish polyester blanket but still expected to pay $4 or more for coffee etc and no service from attendants and again got kicked out of the entertainment hub (it's games only) so bored witless. ""If a customer has an SQ booking they should get a better service than someone who paid a scoot fare and not have to pay again for what is included in an SQ fare"". Plus side: it was a stripped back dreamliner.

On the way back they lost my luggage (checked in with my partners) because the planes were late (AGAIN!) Not one flight left on time because the flight before was late!!! Time of departure is a recommendation not a guarantee of anything!!!

Was told my bag was left behind because of no time to load it (I call BS on that) as only 3 people claimed lost luggage not a full cart of luggage) They are aware of luggage losses in Phuket but seem unable or unwilling to do anything about it.
Totally unhelpful at the airport lost luggage office in Australia. Human staff reading from a script. I had to break down in tears to get any recognition or compassion. Always blaming something else for things going wrong. They lost my claim and weren't going to notify me. I had to keep ringing them to find out my bags were found and then after they priority shipped them to our airport nobody bothered to check they were on the courier delivery van and weren't going to advise me about that until I rang up and demanded to know where my suitcase was. You take the times they offer or tough luck. It's an hour's drive to the airport so no way I had time to go pick it up. Very poor service and just pushed my stress levels to the max.

I have been told I will get my points allocated in the next few weeks (if they can be bothered I suppose).
I won't hold my breath.
I've had better service from Jetstar (a budget airline) and they are underperforming at the moment. Nothing like they're previous service.
Nowhere near the experience expected from a world class airline.

According to our travel agent if you're booking has
""flight subject to change"" due to fare and taxes they are no longer liable for anything going wrong and can do whatever they want because you were warned. Be very careful when booking.

Don’t recommend this airline to anyone. Worst flying experience ever!!!"
Singapore Airlines,Utterly disappointed,2,"Utterly disappointed, not worth the cost of the flight, would be using Etihad or Emirates from now, please improve your services, you used to be the best airline in the world but lately it all went downhill."
Singapore Airlines,Disappointed,1,Travelled to Japan from Melbourne. Crew was good but I got the feeling the Airline is cutting the cost of food. I travelled economy. No breakfast or dinner provided. Singapore to Melbourne we boarded the plane at 7.35 no proper meal for 6 hrs. I have never experienced such bad quality from them before. Very dissapointed.

I have been writing and e mailing since 31 December using their complaints process and have not had one single reply. I have reached the end of their complaints process now. Am now raising on every platform just to prompt a response, I can’t afford to phone them!"
Singapore Airlines,Brilliant airline,5,Brilliant airline. Dealt with our challenging requests with the compassion and understanding needed. Will book again with Singapore. Thanks.
Singapore Airlines,Booking disaster,1,"Booked a return flight from Auckland to London for August 2022. Holiday plans changed and needed to make some changes to the flights, but this was impossible to complete.
On 4 separate occasions i called the Singapore Airlines telephone helpline and talked to operators in the Philippines, spent 5 to 6 hours trying to undertake and confirm simple changes to my flights. On each occasion the operators were not able to process and confirm the changes.

I also (on numerous occasions) emailed Singapore Airlines with the details of the required changes and the details of the telephones conversations.

From all of my attempts to communicate with Singapore Airlines i did not receive a single communication or confirmation in response. Incredibly there was no audit trail or evidence of any of my conversations with them.

Checked my itinerary through the Singapore Airlines website about 3 weeks before i was due to fly to find that my return flight to NZ had been cancelled. I then decided to cancel the flights, but was incredulous when i found that i would have to pay the flight cancellation fee - this despite the debacle that had occurred up to this point.

In the end i had to purchase a last minute, expensive flight with another airline - which was a very simple and straightforward process.

In summary, i spent and wasted significant amounts of time dealing with Singapore Airlines, had to pay a cancellation fee and incurred significant additional cost as a result of Singapore Airlines ineptitude. I have flown with Singapore Airlines previously and have found their aircraft and services to be good, but i am disgusted with how i have been treated on this occasion. On this basis i would recommend other airlines in preference to Singapore Airlines."
Singapore Airlines,Booked Business Class flight months in…,1,"Booked Business Class flight months in advance. Seats got confirmed the seats months in advance (have proofs). When turned up to airport 2 1/2 hours earlier the airline has given the seat to another. No other seats were available and was forced to fly economy in an overnight flight. Dreadful experience, very badly treated and after many emails of complaints for 3 weeks got an apology!

They take your money and sell you a service. Then when you try to receive the service, it’s not honoured. You are given vouchers to upgrade next time. So you have to buy tickets and fly again to upgrade!

These corporations need to be governed better and held responsible.

Beware!"

Singapore Airlines,Very good experience,5,"Very recently flew economy class to Thailand via Singapore and the reverse trip.

The airline was excellent on all flights. Easy online check-in, flights on time, excellent polite efficient air crew on board, seats a little hard but the entertainment system was good.

Was worried given some of the reviews but everything went very smoothly and will use them again."

During the booking they had tricky way , the but scoop flight as a part the trip under the Singapore contract that’s is a rubbish flight
Food was terrible no service

No respect no loyalty
I’m really sorry my self that I trusted this airline payed double no respect
Don’t recommend this airline to anyone"
Singapore Airlines,Not so much about experience but the cost,2,Not so much about experience but the cost of flying with Singapore Airlines long haul to Australia. I have travelled with Singapore Airlines since 1980 and have loved the experience of Changi Airport and delightful Singapore. My husband and I booked a business class flight and accommodation in Singapore over Christmas but unfortunately had to cancel due to my husband being rushed to hospital 2 days before we were due to fly out. We were informed before paying for the package holiday that the fare prices had gone up. I looked at the airfares for this year and was totally appalled at the price of SIA flights. I am now flying with British Airways. I cannot fault the cabin crew but the price rise is not worth it. I will not be able to redeem my considerable amount of Kris points as well.
Singapore Airlines,We flew from Singapore to San Francisco…,1,We flew from Singapore to San Francisco in the business class. 16 hour flight with two screaming babies by me. Didn’t get any sleep and in the morning they served us lunch! Said we are on an SF time schedule. No breakfast. I thought paying the big bucks would give us a quiet flight but not so. Also their fold out beds are really hard and uncomfortable. Terrible experience!!
Singapore Airlines,Baggage lost,1,it is no longer the quality airline that I know yesterday on the flight from Milan to Kuala Lumpur they lost my luggage causing serious damage to my holiday I also sent an email to the lost luggage office who did not even reply airline to avoid
Singapore Airlines,We are sitting in an airplane for 5…,1,We are sitting in an airplane for 5 hours and they are not able to find out what is broken. There is one thing expected by customers hsve a olane rady that works. Bad communication. No solution offered
Singapore Airlines,What Business Class should be,5,Flew Business class Singapore to Brisbane.Excellent service from all staff ground and air crew. Pod configuration was very impressive. Food was outstanding. Nothing was a problem for staff. Fab flight.This is what you expect in Business Class.
Singapore Airlines,Dreadful experience,1,"Dreadful experience. Have lodged a complaint weeks ago, chased for a reply - no response."
Singapore Airlines,LACK LUSTRE AT ITS BEST,1,"Once a premier airline ….. now, no better than a low-cost carrier without the luxury of a budget price!
Appalling and incompetent customer service, only used because their “manage my booking” feature, was not working. Of course, any change attracts a $70 change fee and, surprise surprise, a “penalty” fee, albeit my fare cost a king’s ransom. Please note that all three customer service agents gave me three different prices for the penalty. They are badly trained and read from a script.
Then - they bump you onto their budget airline, Scoot, for one of the legs. Never before have I been served such a diabolical meal. Glancing around, nobody was game enough to eat it. It takes the term “no frills” to the next level. You should, however, get a seat but don’t expect anything more.
For me, there won’t be a “next time” with Singapore Air."
Singapore Airlines,Absolutely appalled by what is supposedly a good carrier,1,"Absolutely appalled by what is supposedly the best airline in the world. We booked our flights for our honey moon in July ‘22 and upgraded to extra legroom (my soon to be husband is 6”6 so a necessity for 16 hours of flying). A month ago we just an update that the flight number had been changed but notice that anything serious had happened. When looking at details to plan hotels I noticed that the outbound flight had been moved from Singapore to Manchester, leaving us for 52 hours in Singapore airport with no compensation, no hotel and no information. After complaining they were able to move the flight from Bali to Singapore out by a day leaving us for 5 hours in the airport but all legroom seats had been taken.

Again no compensation offered however they did say they could offer a complimentary refund on the legroom upgrade that we wouldn’t be able to use for the outbound flight… which is incidentally a legal requirement as they have not honoured the service paid for.

We will not be flying with Singapore airlines again and unless they can resolve the issues we’ve had so far, we will be requesting a full refund."
Singapore Airlines,"I have flight with Singapore Airline in the first time, and never flight with them anymore",1,"I have been flight with Singapore airline from CPH to Vietnam. But I am very unsatisfied even with business class. Terrible, uncomfortable seat
Evenmore unsatisfied, I have to pay a very expensive extra amount even I had paid for an compliment for 1 free changing a retour date. They explained that they donot have more the tickets that are same type of my bought ticket (type J). Who knows what kind of type when we buy online, we have no any remind about that when we were asking to pay an extra. Our flight tickets are 2 business class, and if I want to change retour date, I have to pay an extra with a value is more than 1 retour business class. I feel like I have been cheated.
I will never flight with Singapore airline anymore"
Singapore Airlines,Did Not Even Help My Pregnant Wife.,1,"Took a fully booked midnight flight from Singapore to Sydney with my pregnant wife. During the flight, the man in front of us was very aggressive for some reason and kept on reclining his chair and rocking it to annoy my wife who was sitting behind him. As my wife preferred an aisle seat, we asked if they flight attendants could speak to the man or switch my wife's seat with someone. They attendants said that because the man was so aggressive, there was nothing they could do. So I gave my wife the middle seat instead and which made her feel claustrophobic. I asked the attendants again if they could switch her seat but because it was a fully booked flight, there was nothing that they could do. I am quite disappointed with Singapore Air because we had heard such great reviews about their service.

I also contacted Singapore Air directly via phone, email and web form - all of which have been ignored."
Singapore Airlines,We recently travelled to Australia and…,1,"We recently travelled to Australia and back with Singapore Airlines. Having travelled with them in the past we expected the same experience which was a comfortable seat, very good meals, bag with toothbrush, socks etc. but unfortunately got none of this. A very uncomfortable flight. The meals were definitely not up to standard, in fact would go as far as saying almost inedible. Definitely wasn’t looking forward to travelling home! Would never go with them again and certainly wouldn’t recommend them."
Singapore Airlines,Unimpressed - Lack of Communication,2,"I was informed that the Melbourne to Hobart leg of our flight had been cancelled about 5 days prior to our journey. Upon rebooking I requested 1 day free accommodation because a 35 hour journey would turn into a 59 hour one. No definite answer was given to my request ahead of time or even in person at Changi Airport during the journey. Then, I received an email that we were scheduled to travel on the original scheduled flight, which seemingly was never cancelled. I do not intend to travel with Singapore Airlines again as the situation sparked much anxiety.

On a positive note all legs to and though flew on time."
Singapore Airlines,Horrible Singapore airlines,1,On May 2022 I flew to Bali with Singapore airline. My suitcase was badly damaged on this flight. for 9 months i try to get the damage compensated but still the problem is not solved. apparently they don't know what customer service is and don't want to take responsibility for harm they cause others!!!
Singapore Airlines,Flight home overbooked wanted $600 more to get us home,1,We booked a flight and was told our flight home was overbooked and we would have to pay an additional $600 to get a seat. We booked this flight almost a year ago and paid extra to select our seats in advance. We were on our way to the airport and had to cancel our vacation that we've been planning for over a year. Thank goodness we didn't get stuck halfway around the world. We are still fighting to get a refund. Airline is refusing to refund the cost of the tickets. I don't yet know if we can get the hotel refunded. (We had travel insurance so we have now referred this to them.) Never fly with an airline you can't trust will get you home. Telling everyone I know about this experience. We are experienced world travelers this is the worst customer service I have ever seen. Would give 0 stars if I could.
Singapore Airlines,Appalling customer service for lost luggage.,1,Would give zero stars if I could. Luggage didn’t arrive in AKL…5 days into trip luggage ID GPS shows it arrived in Auckland the day after arrival but not responding to emails or calls and no word on when luggage will arrive and have had to spend $300 of holiday fund to buy replacement clothing. Beyond a joke.
Singapore Airlines,The website doesn't work at all for…,1,"The website doesn't work at all for bookings.
errors errors errors..."
Singapore Airlines,Terrible and appaling airline with poor customer service. 0 STARTRAX should be correct.,1,"Appaling airline. Startrax 5 stars? NO WAY! Lost my luggage for 4 days, and their customer service -Cathleen Jahnz took 6 months to respond to claim and only offered to reimburse 50% of expenses. Let me teach you how to provide good customer service. FIRST, DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE. SECOND, RESPOND AS SOON AS YOU CAN. (you know why you're delayed? because you have too much claims as a poor 0 star airline.) Third, I DON'T WANT the interim stuff i bought, so don't tell me I can still use them and give me 50%. TAKE ALL OF IT BACK.

I WILL NEVER FLY THIS AIRLINES AGAIN"
Singapore Airlines,SIA just don't respond to emails,1,SIA just don't respond to emails. They pretend they care but I believe they don't. I have now sent 4 emails requesting a response to a redemption. I have been so frustrated and would never recommend Singapore Airlines to anyone.
Singapore Airlines,Abandoned in a foreign city,1,"My flight was cancelled at the airport but the cancellation didn't show up on singapore airs computer system so they didn't believe me and would not rebook me even though my travelling partner was rebooked within an hour. They wouldn't do anything and left me abandoned in a foreign city 30 hours from home with no way to travel. I had to find and pay $2500 for a flight on another airline and travel 6 hours by train to another city to catch it. 8 months on singapore still will not refund me or call to discuss, only standard email responses that aren't relevant to the matter. will never fly with them again"
Singapore Airlines,Price gouging thieves.,1,"They will give you one price for upgrading your flight, but mysteriously there will be a technical error and your payment doesn't go through. As soon as you re-try, the price has gone up 20%. What a coincidence this must be. I am starting to despise this airline. I won't be using them again; this is the second time they've done this."
Singapore Airlines,Choose a different airline,1,We flew in the new Airbus A350 from Manchester to Singapore. We had flown with Singapore Airlines several times previously and I am a KrisFlyer member. The seats were narrow and cramped. I was in a middle seat and as well as being cramped I spent the whole flight apart from mealtimes with the seat in front being reclined in my face. I wear varifocals so it was almost impossible to read the screen as it was so close. The seats were very uncomfortable and 4 days later I am still suffering back problems. The fare this time was twice that of our last trip. Singapore Airlines is no longer one of the best. My advice is avoid and fly with a different airline.
Singapore Airlines,I did not pay all this money only to share my seat with a stranger,2,"I recently had the misfortune to fly from Singapore to Manchester on SQ52 on the 24th January.
I always make a point of flying with Singapore Airlines as I find them tge best by a country mile. This particular flight I found was being shared by those people heading for Houston, Texas.
My seat was an aisle seat situated at the rear of the plane. Sat next to me was a man I can only describe as morbidly obese so much so his excess body fat intruded well into my seating space. I therefore only had approximately 75%of my seat making it very uncomfortable to say the least.
I find it difficult to understand how the booking in personnel failed to see there was no way this person could not occupy a seat without spilling out onto fellow passengers seated immediately to his left and right.
This flight was the worst flight I've ever experienced and airlines need to address this problem."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore-Copenhagen no help when sick.,1,"Flew Singapore-Copenhagen with a colleague.
At takeoff she got very sick, and was later confirmed as food-poisoning.
During the 12 hour flight she was -very- sick, and we had help from flight attendants several times.
We where on Economy Premium (very expensive), and I could see several available business class seats.
I asked if I could PURCHASE an upgrade, so she could lie down for some hours.
This was denied by the crew.
I actually expected the crew to suggest the use of business class seats for free, but I didn't want to sound impolite, and I would have gladly paid.
I am extremely disappointed in Singapore Airlines for not helping out.
My colleague was admitted to hospital overnight, and had a lengthy recovery after this.
Will chose another airline next time."
Singapore Airlines,Missing luggage for nearly a month and zero compensation for it.,1,"My luggage went missing for nearly a month after flying abroad. I completed the lengthy delayed baggage claims form as they requested and to date I haven’t received any compensation for it. Their customer care service is slow and horrendous. I won’t ever be flying with them again. I’ve flown with many other more affordable airlines before, and I’ve never experienced a delayed baggage issue like this."
Singapore Airlines,Lack of honesty,1,"Badly let down by Singapore airlines by their lack of honesty. Take great care when dealing with them. Promised compensation, in writing, within 3 weeks. Nearly 10 weeks ago."
Singapore Airlines,Worst customer service,1,"Worst customer service. I have not finished my food but flight attendant won’t let you finish my food and snatch it. It happened in Melbourne to Singapore flight business class, date 8th January 2023."
Singapore Airlines,Had great flight with great proce when…,5,"Had great flight with great proce when I used them 2018 in joint with air new Zealand. Shame I not seen their good options together anymore
Flight I had long haul was very comfy and very accommodating. Plenty of cocktail amd snacks whenever u wanted I'm between meal times"
Singapore Airlines,Worst customer service ever,1,Worst customer service ever. Tried to change a changeable flight to an earlier one as we need to go home. They were unable to find availability despite seats showing online and unable to tell us how much a refund would be. It appears to be a call centre with untrained staff.
Singapore Airlines,How I invested on Bitcoin and got daily…,5,How I invested on Bitcoin and got daily return. I can teach you for free
Singapore Airlines,i agree the worst customer service of…,1,i agree the worst customer service of any airline ive used in my life terrible
Singapore Airlines,Scammers!,1,It’s an absolute disgrace how long you’re taking to refund my money. I want it back asap and will continue to leave you bad reviews until you have helped me
Singapore Airlines,Beware of the beds!,3,"Having flown Singapore air several times to Brisbane before Covid I was looking forward to being in Business Class. However I really disliked the bed. It was a diagonal arrangement and uncomfortable. I found the seat very hard especially on my 13 hr flight from Singapore to London.
The crew on both my outbound flights from London to Singapore then on to Brisbane were very pleasant and caring. When I flew home the service was efficient but lacked warmth.
I used Book the Cook but the meals were nothing special. The starters were the best part of the meal."
Singapore Airlines,I was dressed down at boarding gate…,1,"I was dressed down at the boarding gate by a woman who pulled me aside as I was about to board SQ478 from Singapore to Jhb in Business class. She had told me that my inflight entertainment was faulty and when I told her that that was unacceptable and that I had paid for a business class ticket for comfort and that a plan should be made, she went mad, shouting at me in full view of the other passengers. A gentleman colleague tried to suggest something to her but she would not have it. I don’t know if that is the way you treat your customers. I shudder to think how the lower class passengers are treated.
I simply asked for an apology of which none has been forthcoming for the past 8 months. Your Mr. Mustafakamal Mdsidek Does not seem in the least concerned and is not responding to my complaint.
I insist on having this issue resolved."
Singapore Airlines,mon expérience sur Singapore Airlines,2,"experience personnelle sur vol Singapore-Paris SQ336:
siege 54k dossier cassé impossible de s'allonger. Personnel impoli. Nourriture infecte. Pieds gelés, je n'ai jamais eu aussi froid sur un vol. Singapore Airlines est elle devenue une compagnie à service low cost et à prix élevé ?"
Singapore Airlines,Ne choisissez pas Sinagapour Airlines!,1,"We purchased air tickets from your official website, but when we did not receive our luggage at our final destination, you pushed us to another airline and asked us to deal with them. We paid you, not the another airline. When you delayed your flight, you never inform your passengers, and we sat there and waited! We had to run in Changi airlines to catch the following flight! You lost our valuable luggage and pushed us away! Shame on you SIA!"
Singapore Airlines,"Great way to fly, TERRIBLE way to land",1,"Great way to fly, terrible way to land - if your baggage was damaged. Yes, the in-flight service is impeccable, but the customer service is almost non-existent! My aunt's baggage was damaged and she filed a claim on the spot. The staff even took pictures of it and reassured us that the claim will be processed and we will receive an email from them. We called the number on the claim slip, but it was SATS (the baggage handling company) and they said they can't do anything until they receive a claim from the airlines. 15 days later, not only has the claim not been processed (no emails from them), but I have been asked by Singapore airlines to verify her flight information again, resend images (that was initially taken by them) and I still do not know the fate of her damaged baggage. There is no human behind the customer service number, emails are only answered in 15 working days, and when I call them on the helpline, it's at odd hours - usually in the evenings in my local time - STILL NO EMAIL REPLY. This is supposedly a global brand, 5-star airlines (only when in the air, I suppose), and a Singapore brand. As a Singaporean, I am so embarrassed by our national carrier and the way they treat non-PPS members (the common folk). Only PPS members (i.e. people who buy their business- and first-class tickets directly from the airlines) can request for a call back from the customer support people.

UPDATE: They recently changed their customer support platform from an email address to a webform and they have requested me to resubmit everything. I cannot even...."
Singapore Airlines,Rubbish Customer Services,1,Singapore Airlines changed flight times from Manchester to Penang on the 11th Jan. The connection at Changi depts 5 minutes before the flight from Manchester arrives. The guests are both in their 80’s. No help from Singapore airlines. We have been trying to sort this out since the 29th Dec but just getting the run around from Singapore Airlines. Their Customer Services is absolutely shockingly bad. Never again will I use this airline.
Singapore Airlines,Baggage lost,1,"Baggage lost: impossibile to contact the company and get some help. We know where the luggages are as we put Airtags on those, still, impossible to contact them. Our honeymoon is ruined and we still have 3 weeks of travel ahead of us.
With NO LUGGAGE!! Terrible service"
Singapore Airlines,Miles redemption always unavailable??,1,"Each time we try to redeem miles for flights, it's always unavailable. No matter what airport and what airline partner... not available. I find it hard to believe that a serious mileage programme would run out of redemption flights so quickly, no matter how far in advance we book. It almost feels like Krisflyer has just given up on their redemption programme and left so few seats available, that virtually no one can redeem their miles. So all of us loyal members who have been accumulating miles for years (flying business & first class) simply don't get what we're promised. Very disappointing. It's not the first time that's happened to me on Krisflyer, but this time, I decided to warn others. Please find other mileage programmes."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines are disgraceful,1,"Just like the previous reviewer my luggage was lost on 21st December, it is now 28th December and still nothing. Also no medication, no Christmas presents, nothing to wear, I have tried ringing all numbers all over the world literally and cannot get onto anyone. it is worse than the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was intending to book a 1st class ticket to the States in April but i will never fly with them again ever, I would rather swim!"
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines Support,1,"Terrible experience with Singapore Airlines customer support service!!! My account got audit for some reason, and I'm really having a hard time of clearing this audit. I sent all the necessary and unnecessary documents and finally I got an answer that the account is not under audit anymore, BUT when I called them to make sure, they said ""NO WAY, your account is still on audit status"".
1. No one told me me the reason why the account got audit status, no matter how many times I asked them
2. All 8 agents I spoke with and promised to call me back, never got back to me again
3. No responses for emails, people who were assisting via email via email stopped replying my emails
4. All agents I spoke with told me that they put the case as an urgent matter but nothing happened till now
I have a suspended flight on 4th of January, it was suspended due to audit, no matter how hard I tried to clear the audit and normalize the account by that time, none of the Singapore Airlines was able to help me. That's definitely NOT A 5-STAR AIRLINE SERVICE"
Singapore Airlines,Terrible customer service,2,"Lovely once on board, but don't loose your luggage. Nobody will answer you :(. Christmas presents, medication and personal stuff now missing for more than 48h eventhough they knew it missed a connection when we arrived. An especially... Nobody answered anywhere! Not the phone, not fb, not the chatbot ...!
Terrible customer service!"
Singapore Airlines,Terrible customer service,1,"Terrible customer service. Just because we didn't do advance check-in, SQ gave up our pre-reserved seats that we had paid for. Due to full flight, SQ asked us to move to the next day's flight. In the end, we got on our flight but had to sit separately and at the last few rows. When asked for a refund for the cost to pre-reserve our seats, ground staff told us to write into customer feedback. We did so, providing all our details only to get a 'copy and paste email asking for the same details again for 'verification'. Customer service post pandemic has truly hit rock bottom, not to mention in flight entertainment is limited and the standard of meals have definitely deteriorated."
Singapore Airlines,Worst airline ever,1,Most probably the worst airline I have ever encounter. I have been trying to contact their customer service as they have damaged my luggage. Avoid this company at all cost.
Singapore Airlines,T'was a great flight with SIA from MNL-LDN,5,"T'was a great flight with SIA from MNL - SG, SG - LDN! they have better service than Qatar airways! Good food! There was enough legroom for an economy seat. Staff are superb! Special mention to Imran at flight SQ 322! You were amazing man! God bless you always! and the whole company!"
Singapore Airlines,Refund taking long,1,"Refund taking long. Nobody answers phone for refund request or change dates. Only web request form allowed. Its 10 days of trying to get refund. No refund given yet. Worst experience. No person talks for refund. Only email communication allowed. Reply email comes exactly after 3 days asking more information. After three days, First they ask details of f tickets. Then they ask if payment method is still valid. They will reply again after three days. Like this back and fort they're wasting 3 days at a time. Now system not even recognising my PNR for requesting refund. Fortunately i got their email address to request refund. Very bad customer service. I am doubtful if the refund will come finally. Best thing is to file complaint with USA DOT (department of transportation, government regulatory agency), if you are US resident."
Singapore Airlines,What a shame. Better customer service from Low cost airline,1,"What a shame.

Delayed baggage when I arrived at the Paris airport. The representative told me that it would be sent the next day.

I arrived on Thursday evening and it is now Saturday evening and I have not seen my luggage. Neither received any calls from anyone.

I dont know where is my lugagge and I am left waiting for it at home.

Even low cost airline provide a better customer service support. I have no idea why it is cited as among the best airlines. It is not even Top 20 in my book.

Was my first time flying with this airline and it will be the last."
Singapore Airlines,How can it be 5 stars with a 1 star customer service?,1,"I was on the fence whether to bother writing this review for an airlines which already has 1.9 rating. However, I have NEVER seen this kind of customer in my entire 30 years of flying (to over 80 countries in over 30 airlines) and this compels me to write.

I have been chasing for a refund of my points on a cancelled flight for FOUR MONTHS!!! I have been calling on an almost daily basis over the past 6 weeks, and constantly hear ""we are so sorry, this is with the relevant team"". It is beyond infuriating and not what you would expect even from a dodgy regional airline, let alone a presumed global five star airline. Utterly shameful for Singapore Airlines."
Singapore Airlines,Thieving Company!,1,"I would leave lower if I could. The WORST customer services I have ever experienced. They will not refund my money despite chasing them constantly for over a month now. Terrible at replying to emails, waiting a week now for a reply and responses are usually brief and not addressing the issue. Phone lines are open ridiculous hours and equally unhelpful. Cannot even put into words how truly awful the company is. DO NOT USE!!"
Singapore Airlines,Singapore can't give our money back,1,"We bought our tickets through an OTA, Singapore Airlines ticket number with first and last flights on Lufthansa as Singapore does not fly out of our city. Lufthansa cancelled the first flight, so with the OTA we moved the itinerary one day forward. Same itnerary, one day earlier. 2 weeks after this change was made Singapore sent a message that they have cancelled the entire trip.

In the mean time we had paid for seating for all flights, made directly on Singapore website. Singapore will not refund the money, saying that we should talk to the OTA. OTA doesn't have the money of course and won't deal with the request."
Singapore Airlines,Dead to the world,1,"We read, you read-best airline in the world. But once you started calling SQ customer service in Jakarta, they are dead to the world! You are better off sending an email.
By the time you are on hold you have arrived Changi. I have 12 hrs transit at Changi and they won’t let me change flight as I purchased the cheapest ticket. I guess “beggars can’t be choosy” -no change at all and everyone in SQ customer service are on vacation 365 days/year. Why bother listed a phone number?"
Singapore Airlines,Warm and friendly service,5,Warm and friendly service. Comfortable flights to/from Australia in November 2022. We really enjoyed our experience with Singapore airlines and would be happy to fly with them again. Food was excellent. Entertainment offering maybe not as good as other airlines but only a minor improvement opportunity. Flights all on time.
Singapore Airlines,The flight was part of flight from ukUk. from UK…,1,"The flight was part of flight from UK via frankfurt.We changed to singapore airline for last leg of flight to Australia.We were packed like sardines.The lady in seat in front reclined her seat for whole of journey making it impossible to move or leave my seat .We had seven hour flight torture,We only were offered a glass of water before we landed I know we have had cut backs but we are paying more for our flights and I find this awful from a company that states its one of the best in the world. I will not be flying with Singapore again if I can help it."
Singapore Airlines,Tried to log into my Kris Flyer…,1,"Tried to log into my Kris Flyer membership only to be told password does not match my membership.
Applied for new Password but no link arrived. Tried to apply for new membership but told already a member.
Phoned various SIA numbers but never able to speak to a person. Do not reply to Emails.
What can you do? Most pathetic 'customer service' I have ever experienced and at total variance with image projected."
Singapore Airlines,There's much better alternatives.,2,"This review covers four business class flights with SIA and they don't come close to either Etihad or Emirates. The lounge at Heathrow has a great view with floor to ceiling windows, or it would have if they were clean. Obviously there'd been children wiping their hands and faces all over the glass, a little off putting to put it mildly, and the lounge itself was very busy. The food was awful, I've had better breakfasts at Wetherspoons!
The flight to Singapore was ok apart from the seat configuration meaning that if the seat was in lie flat mode you had to lie at an angle with only a small recess to put your feet. The inflight entertainment offered a very poor selection right across the board, very little on there to interest me which is something I've not encountered on any other airline.
The positives were the food and the crew, both very good.
Flying from Changi on different flight, the lounge was packed and had hardly any western food, not great when my only real choice was crisps. The flight to Adelaide was ok but, given that it was a night flight, it was obvious that the crew just wanted to get us fed and turn the lights down as quickly as possible, a real dip in service there.
Our flight from Cairns to Singapore was a beauty, upon check in we were told there was no Business Class lounge and we were given a voucher each for twenty Australian dollars as compensation. Some compensation this was as it wasn't even enough to cover a drink and a sandwich but surely it would get better on the flight? No, the starter advertised as smoked duck somehow morphed into smoked salmon, ah well, they both live in water so I suppose that was near enough. My wife asked for a glass of Shiraz as advertised in the in flight menu, none available so she settles for the Chianti. Upon asking for a refill we were told they'd run out so it was on to whatever they could find! The choice of five deserts shrank to just ice cream or cheese and biscuits but by this stage we were no longer surprised although when they told us that they didn't have any brandy we were really taken aback. It should be noted that there was only ten business class seats on this flight and they couldn't even service that small number efficiently, not a criticism on the crew, just shocking planning.
Our flight back to Heathrow was again marred by the seat configuration, when you've paid such a premium for business class only to find that you can't get comfortable on a fourteen hour flight is simply not acceptable.
In my opinion, SIA are now a long way behind their competitors and, reading other reviews, it seems they don't care. I have communicated my thoughts to their customer service but I'm not holding my breath waiting for any response or resolution. There are alternatives to this airline and I would suggest that people should explore them."
Singapore Airlines,I've just discovered that KrisFlyer…,1,"I've just discovered that KrisFlyer miles are worthless.
I tried to book a return flight from NZ to UK and despite having over 28k airmiles accrued there was no option to part pay with airmiles despite the website saying you can. The fields to part-pay are missing and after making the booking you go straight to credit card to make payment.
I initiated a live chat with an agent, who to be fair was very patient and helpful to find out why. Apparently you're now not able to part pay with Kris Flyer miles on flights that aren't operated solely by SA despite them being partners with others in the Star Alliance.
The agent found roughly equivalent flights operated by SA but these were much more expensive and after the air miles were applied it worked out much more than the partner-operated flights and with transfer times much longer so it's just not worth applying a discount.
Basically my air miles are now useless. I can't find anywhere on the website that says you have to fly SA only, although there's probably some very small print somewhere.
I've flown SA regularly every couple of years to the UK but I think it's time to find a different carrier."
Singapore Airlines,Worst customer care service ever,1,Worst customer care service I have ever seen. It took 7 days to follow up on the cancellation process and still they are not doing it. And on top of it they says that it will be no show and tickets will be cancelled without refund. Now with no time left they keep on asking for different documents. These people doesn't know the value of time and how to provide a good customer care.
Singapore Airlines,Krisflyer GOLD but less perks,1,"I just became a gold member with Krisflyer. They scrapped the welcome pack ! No more physical card or luggage tags. The worst is when they justify it with that same old sad song :due to Covid19..bla bla bla...can´t hear that anymore. Not sure about Singapore, but where I live we stopped worrying or wasting time to talk about covid many months ago. From my travel experience it is the same pretty much around the globe. I think its a shame when companies still pullout that dull excuse to justify their lack of customer service. I was expecting more from Singapore Airlines."
Singapore Airlines,I am shocked how poor the customer service is…,1,"I am shocked how poor customer service is now for Singapore Airlines. I have travelled with them many times over the years and have always been very happy with the flights and service. But that appears to have changed and the poor reviews people are leaving have been well earned by Singapore Airlines. In September I missed my connection in Kuala Lumpur because the flight to Singapore was late and I missed my Singapore Airlines flight to KL. I was then put on the next flight and that was late too! Because I was in transit I could not change my KL flights and ended up having to re-purchase the tickets. When I got back and contacted customer services, they were very helpful and suggested I put in a claim for the new tickets I had to buy. I did and since then - nothing. For 2 months I have phoned and emailed multiple times, and no one will tell me when they will get back to me about my claim. Then they suggested I put in a complaint. So I did - and guess what, I have not got a response to that either. I also tried Facebook, and they just replied saying they have passed my concerns onto the relevant team. As if I have not been doing that for 2 months. I now realise that I need to face up to the realities that (a) I cannot rely on their flights arriving on time anymore and (b) when that happens, they do not care and have no interest in retaining me as a customer. Still, at least I know this for when I next book flights to the far east!"
Singapore Airlines,What a bad customer service,1,"What a bad customer service. The agent had no authority to solve any problem. I received an email from mySQupgrade to upgrade my seats. What a horrible program. When I upgraded they only upgraded one leg of the journey. Last two days I have spend so much time with them. Now they can’t fix my previous reservation. This is the first I am writing a review for any company.
In the future I will NEVER flight with them."
Singapore Airlines,lost luggage and lack of care,1,"luggage should travel with the flight. They have digital tracking on all luggage, but they make little effort to locate it and return it. This must happen a lot as there is a lot of luggage unclaimed at Sydney airport, so there must be a lot of very unhappy customers.
5 days later, still cant track luggage even though we have had it since Tuesday. Lot of misplaced luggage at the airport"
Singapore Airlines,They cancelled the flight now I have to…,1,"They cancelled the flight now I have to pay the travel agent £50 great!!! NOT

They dont care about their customers, if they cancel the flight, we just shoulder the additional admin fee for it to be transferred. No offer for pay per lounge . My original booking was only 2 hour wait from Chianggi now it will be 8 hours. I have to bite the bullet and pay the travel agent otherwise I will lose the seat.



I WONT TRAVEL WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE THAT IS FOR SURE"
Singapore Airlines,Boarding while there is a power problem…SA,1,"Boarding while there is a power problem sq 945 Bali to Singapore! So plane where no lights. Startup again power then no airco! Delayed already, then excuse and safety demo. Then again captain still problems and sitting already one hour no airco and just have to wait when or if they fixed it

Last time SA for us ;(("
Singapore Airlines,Never again will i fly Singapore…,1,Never again will i fly Singapore Airlines! Been waiting for a flight that was supposed to arrive 5 hours ago. No one knows where the aircraft is and we have not been updated for over 4 hours. No compensation and we were bluntly refused to use their lounge despite even offering to pay. I will never fly with this group again!
Singapore Airlines,I was treated like a king,5,"I was so well looked after by Singapore airlines all the way from the UK to the Philippines as it was my first time out the U.K.
Singapore airlines staff are pleasant and kind and very helping a massive thank you to All my flights from 16th to 31st Oct 2022 from London to Singapore to Cebu Philippines return to London 30th/31st
Food & service excellence 100% lovely

Singapore Airlines,Flew Perth to Bangkok with Singapore…,4,"Flew Perth to Bangkok with Singapore Airlines on 6 October 2022.
The Perth to Sing flight was delayed by 30 mins, but my connecting flight was waiting but was a very long walk to the gate. They should have golf carts to transfer passengers when it is such a long walk to the connecting gate.
I fly home tomorrow, so will report back.
I don't know why so many people are complaining as SQ was fine. Try flying Jetstar then you won't complain about SQ
Fl8ghts were comfortable."
Singapore Airlines,Post-covid customer service takes a sharp dive,1,"Called to make a change to my booking from the 17th to the 19th on 4 occasions and my issue is not resolved.

Fist call: The customer service said she had to split my booking from the rest of the family in order for me to make the change. When I hung up the phone the online system did not allow changes and she had booked me in on any flight on the 19th without consulting me for the time or confirming she was able to make a booking for me for that day. She emailed me my new flight itinerary and I had been booked on two flights home on 17th and 19th.

2nd call: called customer service again, and they said they could not change my flight time on the 19th without incurring a fee for changing the booking. I settled with 19th flight time they had chosen.

I then logged in a few weeks later to book seats and meals online and noticed my flight on the 19th had been dropped and reverted back to the 17th and it now costs over $1000 to book flight on the 19th.

Third call: I called Customer service again and they informed me i needed to pay before a certain time. I informed the customer service the first and second people i had called did not tell me about this process of needing to pay an amount for the flight or notifiy me of an amount i needed to pay and i assumed that was because of the complementary rebooking policy. Neither was it in the body of the email when they resent the itinerary ir the attachment of a cost. Additionally, the intinerary stated the flight was ""confirmed"" for 17th AND 19th. I assumed that was an error on Singapore airlines that they hadnt canceled my old flight or were in the process of correcting my booking.

Fourth phone call: customer service was resistant to resolve my issue with my free change of booking or to make amends for the prior poor customer service communication. I said I would be happy to pay the 500$ had someone told me that was what i needed to do but no one did. They would not accept that or make ammends for their poor communication and only the over$1000 payment for changing the booking.
Also what about the complementary re-booking policy? This is a money grabbing as it's not actually a complementary rebooking.
I have asked to speak with a manager. She was not happy about me asking to speak to a manager, and said i should be available for 38 hours, while previously she had booked in a time to call me back.
UPDATE: I never received a call back from a manager.
Not flying the Singapore Airlines again."
Singapore Airlines,BIG ISSUE with booking payment online,1,"Sadly I made 2 attempts to process and pay for flights to New Zealand yesterday but on both occasions the Singapore Airlines Payment System would not accept my credit card for payment despite my bank accepting security clearance for payment for 2 return tickets with an overnight stop at Singapore for the total sum of £4677 inc seat reservations. I tried calling on their London Office this morning and received a voice message asking to log in some reference. Typically, their prices have increased today! What is wrong with businesses today where you are not allowed to speak to an understanding person at the end of a phone! Even the late John Lennon understood, ""HELP I need some body, not just anybody, HELP I need somebody now""!"
Singapore Airlines,Bad experience,1,On-board service is mediocre for a would be first class company. The long layover at singapore airport is one of my worst travel experience. No assistance from singapore airlines and condescending/ rude staff when enquiring about lounge option and they realize you are not a first class passenger. They should indicate when booking that traveller on economy will get zero (customer) service. Overall very disappointed. Bad value for money. Not coming back.
Singapore Airlines,Countless unpaid refunds...any ethics SA?,1,"I have had the same experience as Benjamin with regards to the refund for £700, it's been just over a year.

Firstly over the phone they said they'd issue the refund in 6 weeks (travel insurance claims need to be submitted within 31 days, so can't claim), i chased via email and phone calls for months. Eventually, after 5 months, i received an email to say they would have issued a refund however my card is due to expire so they won't without confirmation from me that it will be recieved. (Incidentally after 4 months the bank cannot do a charge back, so can't claim.)

After giving them confirmation they said they would be unable to send the refund without a letter from the bank, then after providing them with the bank letter they have said that the ticket time expired after a year and so there will be no refund.

My advice is never book with a company that operates in this way. If you want a refund for anything then go straight to the bank and raise a dispute asap. If you try to go about things the right way you'll get stung and there's no penalty the company stealing your money."
Singapore Airlines,"In-Air experience, great. Customer service, awful and unprofessional.",1,"I'm going to try to write this as quickly and succinctly as possible because I've already spent so much time and headache on this issue but I think it's important to share my honest experience.

Singapore Airlines' in-air experience is great, but their customer service is absolutely awful. I would give zero stars if possible.

6 days ago I tried to switch the departure city for my mom's flight home from Bali. She was scheduled to fly from Bali to Jakarta but she was a little nervous about navigating the terminals so she wanted to fly directly to Singapore from Bali.

I submitted a formal submission on their website and then waited on the chat hold for about 1.5 hours to speak to a representative.

I spoke to a representative named Ayushiita in the Indonesian office. She understood relatively quickly what I wanted to do and told me their change would be complimentary.

To confirm, I asked 'so there will be no fees associated with this change?' She said 'Correct.'

She offered a 1030 AM departure but this was too early as we have a three-hour drive from the hotel. I suggest a 12 or 1 PM departure. We move forward with the desired change but there is a 'technical issue' on their side that did not allow it. I had to go to work so I gave her written consent to make the changes and to email me when they were completed. (I have screenshots of all of this)

72 hours pass (their allotted response time) and I do not receive a message back. I get on the chat again and speak to another representative from the Indonesian office named Romer. It takes him a little over an hour to understand that I am trying to change the departure city. Once he gets it, he tells me there will be an approximately 900-dollar fee for the difference in fare. (I have screenshots of all of this also)

I ask to speak to a manager and he tells me he will put in an appeal and that I will hear from a manager within 72 hours. (another 72 more hours for the fare difference to increase.)

A manager calls me about 36 hours later. He tells me the $900 fare difference must be paid if we desire to take the 1 PM departure and he will look into other options. The 1030AM flight that was offered originally 5 days before (that previously would have been approx a $120 fare difference) is also now $900. He looks into other possible dates.

Everything is even more expensive than $900.

I ask him what will happen if my mom takes a separate airline to get to Singapore. He tells me the entire rest of the flight will be canceled.

I ask if its possible to upgrade my mom to a higher class. I don't ask for this to be complimentary due to the headache because at this point I don't believe they would offer that anyway. I offer to use miles from my Kris+ membership (25,000)

The manager tells me there are no available upgrades, only a waitlist. I ask how many miles it will be to upgrade should it become available. If it does become available, it will cost approx 92,000 miles.

I surrender to the money monster, accept defeat, and say 'My in-flight experience with Singapore Airlines has been wonderful but customer service has been a complete nightmare.'

'I'm very sorry to hear that sir. Have a nice day.'

It's as if there are two separate entities - customer service and in-air experience."
Singapore Airlines,Very disappointing,2,"Very disappointing. Once upon a time it was a very good airline. Now, cramped sits and poor food. From Singapore to Sydney, a 10 hours flight we were served only one small bottle of water during the night and a breakfast consisting in some chicken with pasta as the 'scrambled eggs' were finished (???)."
Singapore Airlines,Extremely poor Experience,2,"Myself and wife booked flights on Singapore Airlines. Manchester Singapore Cebu SQ051/TR388 October 07/10/2022.
Tried to check in online from 2 days before I tried so many times
using Customer Ref also the ticket nos Keeped saying no such booking. I phoned there London office told them the proplem the Agent said he could not do anything. I said ok if I give you my customer ref and E ticket nos could you confirm the booking. He confirmed the details were correct and departure date was in order. But he could not check us in.
I had to go through the agent I booked with spent 40 mins explaining. At least she said I check you in,but very time consuming.
At check in at Manchester arrived 3 hrs before flight.So wait time short.The check in member was not very helpful,1 She never asked if I had a visa for the Philippines. 2 The lady just asked if we had a world health pass. My wife showed hers on her phone and she took just a casual glance,but not at mine.3 We a bag allowance of 25 kilo along with 7 kilo hand Carry bags 24+ other 25+so✓ on both. As we had 2 hand carry on,plus I had a bag of medical Machine. I asked if one of those hand luggage could go in hold because it was too cumbersome and She said no if you want it in hold I have to pay. Never had a problem before with S/A or with other Airlines. When on the flight very find a overhead bin. We had to use bin further up and meny customers were having same problem.
The flight crew was good. However the choice of meals. It was Curry or something else. The Curry was EXTREMELY HOT. No prior
warning a roll then a Ice cream.No diced fruit no starter. it was marked up as Lunch. It was approx 13.00.Our next food was several hours later I and many other passengers were expecting Dinner.No we had Breakfast. Scrambled eggs sausage and few bits and bobs. Again no diced fruit os a carton of orange juice. The hot food was Barely warm and the diced potatoes were not fully cooked. Now You don't get a little menu of what to expect.
Along with poor flight entertainment and not meny blockbuster films. The music content was extremely poor.
At end of flight there was no information of transfer flights. There was a number of passengers were asking about there trans gate and the shortness of there connecting departure. Were told to see ground staff!!!
Connection flight.TR388 SCOOT
Singapore/Cebu
Extreme problem of too many bags seat row 30 bags in row 12 bins. Not impressed.
ok it was a short flight But the meal was chicken rice.i found one small bit of chicken. Loads of small spicy Sausage and rice. In fact I had a few mouthfuls and left the rest. it was very poor.
So my Experience with Singapore Airlines this time Very Very Poor."
Singapore Airlines,I am still waiting for £700 refund for…,1,I am still waiting for £700 refund for a flight ticket that they have agreed to refund but a year later still haven't sent me the monies. It is impossible to get through to them and they take weeks to respond to emails. I have just be sent an info from them responding to another customer's refund request and including all the personal details of the other complainant which surely must be a GDPR compliance issue.
Singapore Airlines,Worse customer service,1,Worse customer service. Bought a standard eco ticket. The term and condition said we can change or schedule for extra $70. Try to reschedule and I’ve been told by this call center that my flight can not be changed or rescheduled. Got no choice but to buy another ticket from other airline and still will be fined for no show fee. It’s not the airline I have been travel for last 15 years anymore. Won’t come back in future.
Singapore Airlines,Immaculate and reliable service,5,Immaculate and reliable service. Times have been tough for many airlines and I imagine that people mostly only share their negative experiences here. I have travelled with Singapore airlines multiple times over the past months and they’ve done an amazing job every time
Singapore Airlines,Worst customer service!,1,"Been trying to reschedule or change flight from past 1 month but the email keeps going back n forth. Worst customer service, they just send 1 liner email saying go to this link and open a new request.

Been a nightmare dealing with singapore airline customer service."
Singapore Airlines,"Customer service, what a JOKE",1,"Absolutely disgusting service from Australian ""help desk"". Wanted to simply change flight dates as I couldn't complete the transaction online. Received 3 separate emails asking for and receiving the same information. Finally get (an inflated) quote. Agreed to it even after providing information from their own website of prices and availability. Then receive a final quote of 2.5x the cost of a reschedule, almost the price of my original return ticket. Now I'm ""somehow"" completely unable to manage my own booking on their site. ""Change flight "" option is now unavailable for me to use. Funny that.

Flights are still great. Helpful and accommodating staff. Customer service Australia is an absolute joke.
Disgusting service"
Singapore Airlines,What is it with asian airlines?,1,"What is it with asian airlines? I really need to reassess the opportunities to cross from one hemisphere to the other without them and seriously looking at alternatives to avoid them completely in future. Singapore airlines used to be one of the best but now they've joined the torture airlines which don't even allow a bottle of water to be taken on board. This used to be ok when there was actually service oriented staff on board. Now you're supposed to sit there for 12+ hours without service. When dry mouth from the air conditioning gets too much you can buzz for someone to bring you 5cm of tap water in a plastic glass for relief. Wow if I were in a prison I'd expect the same. No snacks either - oh we have dessicated peas and crackers. Yuk. No thanks I had those and they were aweful.
Most western countries have boarding lounges with outlets that will sell you water, food, coffee whatever you need to plan some comfort for your long haul flight. All the Bangkok Singapore Dubai Doha boarding lounges etc treat you like a terrorist, all the while there is little to diminishing service on board to accomodate this fact.
On my last flight not only did I have 50 minutes to run from one side of the airport to the other, catch a train and keep running dragging luggage with wheels across carpet in 30 degree indoor humid heat at Changi, but the single water fountain where you can refill your empty water bottle in the boarding lounges was also gone. So no water either. Seriously. I will honestly look at other airlines in future that are not these Asian airlines that don't understand what it's like to do long haul repeatedly under these conditions. Torturous."
Singapore Airlines,Night and Day vs BA - Thank You Evi!,5,"Night and day experience vs BA (who I have nothing against). Had to book a premium economy multi-city trip (which BA can't do on its website) so not only helped me with this, but rung up to confirm seats and had someone answer within 1 minute (I'm used to more like 30!), help us with the trip, then when we couldn't get seats together on one leg of the trip, proactively put us in the exit row and called us the next day to confirm!

Service absolutely next level. THANK YOU EVI for owning the process from start to finish and making what was supposed to be a mundane admin task a very rewarding one!"
Singapore Airlines,The Worst Travel Experience of My Life,1,I had exactly the same experience as Penny below. This is my first flight with SQ and certainly my last. I have been travelling internationally for 40 years and this is by far my worst experience. My bag did not arrive with me in Paris after transiting in Changi. After 6 days I have no idea where it is. Calls to their local 'office' are diverted to a call centre (in the Philippines?) who offered no help and advised me to send an email. I have had no response to my 3 emails. It is clear that SQ simply do not care about their customers once they have gotten them off the plane and any claims they might make about customer service are in my experience a sham. Please avoid the misery I am going through and take any other airline rather than SQ.
Singapore Airlines,Took 3 recent flights with SA recently…,1,"Took 3 recent flights with SA recently and the airline and app/ site have gone from excellent to very, very poor.
Flights late, baggage not making connecting flight( had to get taxi back to Hanoi airport next day to retrieve my hold luggage, even though flew business class Jakarta/Changi/ Hanoi) and app sign in problems commonplace."
Singapore Airlines,Worst Website on the Market,1,"I cannot believe, that such a First Class Airline has the WORST WEBSITE on the market. Bamboo Airlines is far more user friendly than SQ. I have tried on numerous occasions to book flights on SQ using their website, and it’s so bad I go to another Airline. I’m not even able to book SYD-SIN return? Absolutely useless. I’m sure they would be loosing so much business due to its ineffectiveness."

Singapore Airlines,ZERO customer service - DO NOT TRAVEL WITH THEM!!!!,1,"If I could give Singapore Airlines MINUS stars then I would, they do not deserve even half a star - I am begging everyone NOT to use this disgraceful company!!!
This airline is supposed to be the best in the world yet has absolutely NO customer service or processes for anything. I was flying from Heathrow to Bali for my honeymoon and they lost my bag, they couldn't have cared less - gave me a measly £30 at Bali airport for 'essentials' and then proceeded to send me an automated email every day saying they were doing their best to locate my luggage, what they were actually doing I do not know!! You can email, tweet, call the Lost and Found offices as much as you want but NOBODY will reply to you, they do not care. I was so desperate for my bag I called the Lost and Found office 42 times in one morning and not once did they pick up.
After 10 days, I finally got my case back but ONLY because my sister had travelled to Heathrow Airport off her own back and literally begged to speak to somebody there who could help. It turns out the bag never even made it on the plane and was lost in the sea of luggage at Terminal 2. Fortunately a member of staff found it a few days later and put it on the plane, only for it to be sent to the wrong hotel with no warning they had even found it!! If my sister hadn't have gone to the airport herself I know I still wouldn't have my belongings back, it is an absolute disgrace and bordering on theft that they are holding hundreds of bags ransom in the airport because nobody can be bothered to go down and put them on the right flights. The start of my honeymoon was absolutely ruined and I had to spend the first 3 days re-buying all my toiletries and clothes.
Singapore Airlines has absolutely no process for missing/delayed bags and having thoroughly scrolled through their Twitter I have seen hundreds of people in the same situation. It is impossible to speak to an actual human being and all you get are generic responses.
If you value the contents of your suitcase and do not want your carefully planned trip RUINED, DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE!!!!!"
Singapore Airlines,DON'T FLY WITH THEM,1,"Singapore airlines cancelled the first leg of my flight and couldn't find another solution for me. I emailed them multiple times and called them like 10 times, the only solution they found was either a refund (2 weeks prior my flights so I couldn't afford to book another one cause the prices had triple) or re routing me from Paris with a 13h layover in Singapore!! I had to take the only option or couldn't go back to Oz so I now have to book on my own expenses my transport from Marseille to Paris, a hotel in Paris before and wait 13h in Singapore WITHOUT any compensation from them!!!!!

I tried to ask for a flight to Sydney as there were 3 flights available online everyday from Paris but they were not available for rebooking apparently!!!
I never got the chance to talk to a manager. I spent hours and hours on the phone asking for one but they were ""never available"".

It really became a budget airlines. I'll never fly with them EVER! Even the seats weren't confortable, the food very basic. A very very bad experience I don't recommend them!!!!"
Singapore Airlines,Vial Liars,1,"I am a sole mother traveling to London from Brisbane and Singapore airline kicked me out of the bassinet seat for the London leg due to ‘an aircraft change’. Then I was told that they have no more bassinet seats as it’s first come first served and I wasn’t first - despite having booked this flight three months earlier (and having been confirmed in the bassinet seat at time of booking). Singapore then lied and lied to me, first promising me the bassinet will be assigned at check in (LIE) and then telling me they will block out the seat next to me so I can lie the baby down to stretch her limbs from time to time (LIE). They have done NOTHING to help me but lied and lied. I am now faced with having a busy, wriggling 5 month old on my lap for 13 hours, alone with a stranger sat next to me which is nothing short of child cruelty and mental abuse of a mother!

Oh and I am a silver KrisFlyer member for all the good that has done.

Singapore you are disgusting and vile to treat a single mother this way."
Singapore Airlines,Never again Singapore Airlines,1,"On my flight back from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam I was given a broken chair that was unable to recline. Three stewards have reviewed the chair and regrettably informed me that the chair was indeed broken and no other seat was available on the fully booked plane. I was told I will be receiving compensation for the services not provided by email.

What followed was disgusting. I received a voucher for the Singapore Airlines KrissStore of only 100 Singaporean dollar of a 1500 euro retour flight.

Furthermore, the shop is outrageously expensive compared to local stores, most items are not deliverable to my country and if they are Shipping costs are 65+ Singaporean Dollar excluding Tax fees.

After not providing the services you paid for they will try and steal more money from you through the bogus store compensation.

After months of discussing and waiting through email support they state there is nothing they can do because there is no medical proof of injury due to the broken chair.

Never again Singapore Airline."
Singapore Airlines,SIA advertising for dates that are not available - again!,1,"SIA sent me an email last week advertising Early Bird flights (from Australia) to Europe and elsewhere. There was a further advertisement in the Sunday paper for these Early Bird deals.
When I tried to book however the dates (in Sept/Oct 2023) were not showing and I could not book. Yes, I know seats are not released until 355 days prior, but why advertise for those dates if they are not available within the specified booking time?
I called the ContactUs helpline to assist. Very Bad Idea. The lady I spoke with insisted that the deals only applied to flights from INDIA!!! After much argument I had to send her a copy of my email and then despite the irrefutable evidence before her eyes claimed that my booking dates were not part of the SIA offer. Gritting my teeth I suggested she click on the link for the terms to be displayed which would have clearly shown my dates were within scope - but she then claimed she could not open the link. Convenient.
I was on the phone for over 1 hour before I hung up in disgust (I had been on hold for ages).
SIA did this the last time I travelled in 2019 and had to use a travel agent to manage the booking. It’s what I am doing now to save my stress levels.
SIA is absolutely hopeless - why advertise for dates that are not available? Why employ staff who don’t know what they are talking about and obviously haven’t been trained?
No one has yet got back to me regarding my nightmare experience - Shame on you Singapore Airlines."
Singapore Airlines,Change The trip sporadically to allow…,1,"Change The trip sporadically to allow more expensive ticket to be sold. I bought ticket for 4 hours transit. Singapore Airlines deliberately change to 20 minutes. Once we arrived in airport, they change it and claim it never enough and make the transit 13 hours. Very sneaky. I don't want that 13 hours transit because i can get it much cheaper price and chose more convenient flight. But at the end they give us that just because they can."
Singapore Airlines,Very poor help (acctually no help if you want to change the flight - they add super extra costs),1,"For many weeks my problem hasn't been solved. I asked via e-mail for making a change in the reservation, and they reply after a week changing prices within the time. They cannot find any new date with as low additional costs as possible and want from me to define exact day. When I did it, I had to wait one week and they agreed but expected high additional payment. They want much more money for making a change in dates (it is possible in the already bought reservation) than it was paid. They want even more than for new tickets. Cancelation is possible with a refund equal to 10% of the initial price. You were my favorite airlines, now I am going to use other companies what will be cheaper than making the change in SA. I am disappointed as you cannot solve a relatively easy issue: 1) change dates in the reservation of my wife without super extra additional costs, 2) sell me a new ticket for the same outbound flight as for my wife, 3) add an infant to the reservation of my wife. Easy, isn't it? Shame on you!"
Singapore Airlines,Very Poor Digital Experience,1,"The digital customer experience and link between App and Website is pathetic, in fact it has been worse than LCCs. Despite entering my mileage number and trying to select a seat for my upcoming flight both from the Website as well as App the experience was really bad and I had to give up after wasting a lot of time"

Singapore Airlines,False Advertisement of flights and prices,1,"We wanted to book over the official website a flight to Singapore and on to Bali and return with each way a layover in Singapore. The flight was shown int hier website, but when it came to the payment, it showed each time an error. After several days trying, I was finale able to call customer service in Germany after a weekend break. After about en hour, we found, out, that a layover over 48hours would not be possible. However, the flight was always advertised. I call this false advertisement. We now had to book separate flights and pay a substantial amount more due to that. We wrote several times to Singapore Airlines with no excuse and a simple prewritten text, that changes do happen and they can't do nothing about it. I'm very disappointed and it is not Singapore Airlines like. On top, we have to pay for seats that are bulkhead seats if we want them. Wenn you pay already for a greater price, due to their issues on the web, it should be at least offered for free, but you can imagine it, it was a no.
We will have to think twice next time, if we book a flight with Singapore Airlines in the future. Apparently they don't care about customers anymore. Or perhaps the German crew just doesn't know how to deal with customers."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines refusing to honour their refund policy,1,"Singapore Airlines cancelled a portion of our flight and their offered alternative was not acceptable because it arrived too late to make our on going flight.

They sent an email saying ""for flights cancelled by Singapore Airlines please be assured you will be able to rebook your flight OR get a refund for the unused portion of your ticket"". There were no other conditions attached to this statement but when I subsequently asked for the refund for the now unused portion of the flight (4 x Business Class tickets from Singapore to Jakarta) I was told the only way I could get a refund for this portion was to cancel ALL tickets on the booking. This would mean rebooking the 4 Business Class tickets from London to Singapore too which, even they agreed, had risen in price substantially since I booked it so I would be even more out of pocket! In any event, I still wanted these flights so saw no need to cancel them especially as they already told me to ""be assured"" they would refund me for the unused portion of the ticket. They have steadfastly refused to do so and I have had to incur further cost with another airline (£700) buying tickets that suit the itinerary.

It is very disappointing that they should tell outright lies in their emails and expect customers to suffer financially when the events that led to the loss were through no fault of their own."
Singapore Airlines,Appalling third world customer service,1,"I recently flew Singapore Airlines from Brisbane to Cape Town, only to have them lose my luggage. Three weeks later I am approximately $6500 out of pocket and despite daily phone calls, hours left on hold, leaving multiple voice messages, emails, online enquiries and attempts to live chat, I have had zero response from the airline. Appalling third world customer service."

In addition you cannot seem to change even well before flight. They also kept our main luggage at Singapore airport because they deemed we were in transit even though we were staying 2 nights. Will never ever use them again. There was no customer service at any point even though tried to be patient. Over an hour at Denpasar trying to check in with a 6 year old child. Could not get anything out of them. Disgusting.

Singapore Airlines,Never again,1,"Never again. Booked my special holiday with Singapore Airlines and could not have been less impressed.

On way out, 8 days before holiday they moved me onto a later flight (11 hours later) resulting in my holiday losing a day. I also paid for a hotel at Heathrow that could not be refunded and a room in Sing for us to crash in on arrival.

All my flights were ticketed through SingaporeAir, and internal flights were operated by Scoot (that’s a whole another story - shambolic airline). On way back, flight was cancelled. Lack of information, scant refreshments offered (no care for passengers). Got dumped into a hotel at 1am and then shipped back to airport midday next day for a 7pm!!! Flight.

Net result we were moved onto a flight back to UK 24 hours delay to schedule. No apology, no communication and family split up on 13hour flight back.

Thank you for ruining my holiday. Since returning 17 August, I have tried to get someone anyone to listen to my complaint and consider compensation under EU law - as yet all I have received is a wall of silence."
Singapore Airlines,"Hello all,",1,"Hello all,

This is a honest review with our experience with Singapore airlines.
A family of 4 from Paris to Kota Kinabalu Borneo departure date 30th June till the 25th august.
Our flight was Paris Singapore, Singapore to kota Kinabalu and the same coming back.

When we touched down in Singapore from paris we received a mail saying that our return ticket back from kota Kinabalu to Singapore was changed but when we looked in detailed for the timing coming back we noticed that with the new ticket times we would miss our connection flight back from Singapore to paris.
We replied with a mail explaining and they had to change the time of course, you think this would be a easy task you think! 2 weeks later no reply with our request to change the flight times.. So we sent another mail, We suggested that we can be flexible with the return flights and we was thinking of going to Kuala lumpar so maybe you can send us there instead of flying to Singapore, they never answered to this mail. So to make it easy we thought we would buy ourselves tickets to Kuala lumpar because we still had our return ticket from Singapore to paris.

We asked them for a refund for the flight from kota Kinabalu to Singapore as we don’t need it, again no answer. This was starting to go on and on…. Then they replied asking for our names to cancel the flight. We said right from the start many times in email writing in big capitals just that we want the money back from kota Kinabalu to Singapore thats all. This point it was different people replying to our email every time so I knew it was confusing for them, it was just a simple task from the beginning!

So then we received a email saying that they have canceled the whole trip back to paris. Crazy we never asked for this. We replied saying you have made a mistake read your emails. Next day they refunded the whole ticket price in our bank, so now we had no ticket back to paris.
They did say we can re-book but the price was 3 times more expensive how nice of them to ask!

Wait for it this is when it was pathetic. every day speaking to 3 different people on the phone emails over and over for about a week, it was a joke really bad costumer service.
This story was going on for 5 weeks now so when we arrived in Kuala lumpar we went direct to Singapore airlines office in the airport explaining the story for the 10th time. This is really what you want while on holiday for 2 months for a stupid mistake.

Singapore airlines said they will investigate the issue. We said just book us back in for the return flight from Singapore to paris, all the flights were booked up of course, normal 10 days before departure…
This problem started because they never read the emails from the start, not even replying to our question from the beginning of this saga.. I said just read your email it all there clear for you to understand.

What a surprise they found a flight back to paris on the same day!

I don’t really write mail this but this was a joke from start to finish, shocking costumer service, they were completely lost.

And what did we get from this saga you think? A big fat zero not even sorry.

Borneo Malaysia, we love you but we will never fly with Singapore airlines again!

Your truly James and Beatrice.

Rant over hope you enjoyed."
Singapore Airlines,Took my booked seat off me,1,"Booked, paid extra and confirmed an aisle seat in Prem Economy months prior to departure. SQ327 Munich to Singapore. Star Alliance Partner (Air NZ) confirmed seat 33C (aisle seat booked). On the day Singapore Airlines gave the seat to somebody else. Now I am trapped for my 12 hr flight.
The check in staff were helpful but said they were unable to help.
Will not use this airline again."
Singapore Airlines,"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!",1,"My luggage arrived nearly 40hours after my landing. I made some emergency purchases as instructed by the airport officer. I've been contacting Singapore Airlines by phone, email and social media for the last 3 weeks and the company does not provide a solution just link after link, phone number after phone number. I believe the airline has spent tons of money in PR as their customer service is terrible. You only know a company when you have a problem. All I suggest is to Avoid Singapore Airlines. Fly Qatar, Fly Emirates, Fly Etihad but DO NOT FLY SINGAPORE."
Singapore Airlines,Such bad experience with both their website and customer service dial number,1,"One of the worst websites I have ever seen. Impossible for the customer to navigate through their maze like pages. Getting help should only cost you one or 2 clicks. I had to go round and round before i could find things which ended in frustration. Dialing the customer service number also gets you through a navigation dial menu for at least half hour before you are able to speak to someone. Such a headache.

I am really dissapointment from the nr 1 airlines."
Singapore Airlines,Empty shadow of its former self,2,"You know the phrase ‘it’s not what you did, but how you did it?’. I’m assuming any old carrier has the ability to take people around the world, Singapore airlines used to do this and do it very well indeed. Not so much any more it seems! This post covid world seems to have changed the attitude of the company and Singapore air, no longer cares.

I was on a flight from Melbourne to london, for some unknown reason our selected and paid for seats had been changed by the airline. Turns out that This also forced the family who had booked these seats together to also be moved, leaving parents to look after their young kids across multiple seat rows.The seat we now were in were those horrible seat facing the parting wall and this put my wife’s back pain to a level we’re she had to sit on the floor to try and relieve the tension. She was promptly scolded for doing this by the air hostess and told she can stretch standing up in the corner.

The family next to us were also receiving their fair share of in-flight-discipline as the baby crib install in front of them was only to be used if the child was sitting in a certain way. This lead to awe inspiring parent/child juggling/trying to eat/passing the child around.

It’s like the staff became mean or poorly trained in service in the last 5 years or so….or during covid all the good staff were laid off in favour of cheaper agency workers. Sure they do the job, but this is like the lunch lady in a school that dished out a plate of real crap as opposed to an enjoyable experience.This has left Singapore airlines as a cheap imitation ’husk’ of its former self. Just dealing out a plate of real crap - you reached you destination, what more do you want us to do?"
Singapore Airlines,They Don't even deserve 1 Star,1,"I have a business class redemption booking I needed to change the date on. I checked availability online, plenty of seats for a booking a year in advance.

The SQ system online would not allow me to change them myself so now the saga begins.

After not being able to get through on the phone I emailed them by the time they responded ( 7 weeks later ) of course the seats I wanted were no longer available.

So after calling the call centre for 3 days straight and being on hold for a long time, could not get onto anyone from the redemption team. Then finally someone called me back.

I could see available redemption seats for other dates online ( thankfully I am flexible ) however the agent could not see the seats and told me that there is availability if you are booking a brand new redemption seat but not for re-bookings? WHAT? How does that even make any sense. So if I am booking a new booking there is seats but because I am changing dates I cant get the seat?

Ok so then I cancelled by original booking and said refund my points and ill go ahead and do it myself online with a fresh booking.

Thats a AUD189 cancellation fee ( they would not waive it even though I was rebooking instantly and the issues with this ALL lie on their end ) and a loss of expired points.

I got the feeling the outsourced call centre agents have no power to make any decisions and there was no-one to escalate to. At least thats what they told me.

Fine go ahead.

After all that I first have to transfer more points to get the right number. I go online to make the booking, the outbound flight shows available I go through to the payment screen and the booking comes up as waitlisted?????? Like WHAT?

Honestly I am so utterly exhausted at this stage ( probably what they want ) that now I am waitlisted for this redemption seat a year out even though it comes up as available.

This will be the LAST time i fly with SQ. Their lack of customer service and plain commonsense blows my mind.

This is what happens when companies try to cut costs and outsource their customer service. It just DOES NOT WORK.

I am still in utter disbelief about this whole process. SQ used to be worth the premium, however service starts when you book and they have lost me with their outsourced customer support which is just atrocious."
Singapore Airlines,NEVER FLY SCOOT.,1,"Please allow me to start of with a positive, Singapore Airlines have always been a very acceptable airline to fly with.
I have just returned from a four week holiday in Phuket, From Phuket to Singapore was Great could not fault it.
The flight from Singapore to Melbourne is another matter, I was an assisted passenger and should have been provided with a wheelchair, NONE available , we were taken to the security section and there was three hundred people lined up, rightly so, the young man guiding us took us to the front of the queue, but the person in charge told us very rudely to get to the back of the queue, ( I cannot stand for very long ) but others seeing what happened invited us into the front of the queue, I had a large Yellow sticker on my arm , but again this person , who seemed to be in charge, continued to be very rude,
eventually we all got through into a holding area, when we boarded the aircraft we were taken to the very back of the plane , row 43, only one row behind us ,I had requested a forward zone seat , ????
I also requested a centre isle seat but we were given a window seat, which meant we had to get out of our seats each time the other passenger needed to go to the Toilet.
We had been travelling for 12 hours by this time , but it was another five (5 ) hours before a ""SO CALLED "" meal was offered, and to be very polite it was SLOP, I would not feed it to my dog!!!!!!!!!!
To say I am very disappointed is an understatement, YES I will fly with Singapore airlines again, BUT when they are paired up with SCOOT, NO WAY WILL I FLY WITH THEM AGAIN.

Singapore Airlines,Lost 1 luggage each on my to and fro Wellington to London via Singapore,1,"This is the worst experience I've ever encountered.

We departed to London via Singapore from Wellington NZ on 29th July 22', been 3 weeks and they have yet to locate my missing luggage.

Shocked yet again, when we returned to Wellington on 21st August 22', we had another luggage missing now!

This has created such a mess and inconvenience to my wife and I with some sentimental stuff and personal belongings in the lost luggages and not forgetting the amount we had to spend to recover the lost items whilst our trip.

I am gonna blow this matter huge if I dont receive my lost luggages!

Good luck Singapore Airlines.

Good flight crew but having to lose 2 bags in our return trip?!"
Singapore Airlines,Very superlative worst reputed airline,1,"Very superlative worst reputed airline. No refund even after lapse of their stipulated 5 business weeks. The delay of refund even after refund order issued by them is questionable when good technology is being adopted by them. Several reminders sent but simple reply from them is ""refund order issued and you are in que"". Ticket booked from Hyderabad to Melbourne for my wife and me and there is one letter missing in wife name. They have suggested cancellation of both tickets and issued fresh booking reference for same tickets with name correction and advised me to make payment once again for fresh booking instead of adjusting with first booking amount which was with them . They said that first booking full amount will be refunded immediately. Ticket booked on 19.4.2022, but till today amount not refunded. It is reputred airline but earning reputation in extending worst customer service. They are just making business with publick money with delayed tactics. Please find their following reply with fresh booking reference____

Thank you for writing to Singapore Airlines regarding the name correction.

As per our conversation, we have created the new booking reference which is 6525ZU and have e-mailed the travel itinerary for your reference.

Once the tickets are issued for both passengers we would then submit the full refund request for the original booking reference 57QDM5.

Can any one suggest easy way to get refund from this reputed Singapore Airlines"
Singapore Airlines,Callous air-line.,1,"Surprised, disappointed and angry that Singapore Airlines callously profits from its customers affected by Covid-related circumstances beyond their control. We had to buy very expensive tickets just as travel opened-up last December 2021 but due to delays at the UK Home Office, we have not been able to use the return ticket within 6 months. (The Home Office blames the Ukraine crisis.) The airline has refused an extension or a refund for the unused portion, value £1,110 (US$1,400), and that is despite us allowing it to hold on to our money rather than taking a refund while waiting for over a year to be able to travel. Easy pure profit for them, a double loss for us as we'll have to fork out a similar sum for replacement tickets, and a big chunk of my meagre pension! The airline wouldn't reply directly to me and only eventually reluctantly replied to the travel agent..

Update 23 August. Singapore Airlines Twitter Support suggest I try (again) to submit a formal feedback complaint - the same means that had not brought an earlier response. So I went through all the trouble of re-registering and completing the form but there was no response when I clicked ""Submit"". So I did it from another browser and not via my VPN. Same thing. Suggestion and response:
""Hi John, you may wish to try clearing your browser's history/cache or ensuring that the latest app version is installed before submitting your concerns on our website/app. Thank you.""
@SingaporeAir
""No thanks, simply too much trouble, the system is intended to make it hard for customers to give feedback, no other means provided? I've been through all that before and no-one answered. If the company cared they'd find a way to get back to us.""
Update 1 October 2022 - Incredible Singapore Airlines has replied at long last and awarded us a refund on the unused return portion of our £2,219.06 air tickets - £27.10! That's nowhere near even the airport charges or taxes they've kept."

Singapore Airlines,Update to my initial review 18th july.,1,"Update to my initial review 18th july.
SIA has not refunded my points as of today 20th August, that I accidentally transferred to my wife's SIA account on the 28th April. I called them 2 minutes after I realized what I had done. They assured me it would be refunded so I could book the redemption flight I had booked to leave on the 29th July and join my wife in Japan. They deleted my redemption booking 2 weeks before departure So I booked a flight same day and thought i will sort the points out later.

Filght was paid for and was viewable in the SIA app. I thought all good. How wrong I was. Wife rang me asking for flight details, I opened the app, flight was deleted. I rang them and asked what happened and they said Amex didn't pay the fare so they deleted the flight. Been with Amex for 30 years, my available credit is 50K plus. They told me SIA almost immediately reversed the purchase.

All throughout this fiasco I have been extremely polite to the phone staff, even when I had to ask a couple of agents to repeat their questions several times as I couldn't understand their English.

Eventually gave up after after I lost count the amount of times I contacted them for help. I booked with JAL.( exceptional service) and I've all but written off the 69996 miles I transferred.

Be extremely careful when booking. They are full of empty promises and will string you along until they delete, change or just refuse to do what they say."
Singapore Airlines,Baggage Lost and no service...no help,1,"Baggage Lost and no service...no help. I lost my luggage with all my clothes and personal belongings for already 3 days and get no assistance and no help from Singapore Airlines at all. They, the lost and found of SIA in Singapore, does not pick up the phones for already 3 days, although we kept on calling every hour. No customer service and not customer friendly at all. They do not even give any information related to my luggage. Never ever fly with this Airline!!!!. This is the worst Airline I have experienced as a frequent flyer!!!!."
Singapore Airlines,Customer support deplorable since it got outsourced,1,"As people in the review section has already said, the outsourced customer service is insanely bad. I got double-charged for a ticket and after two months and three calls with the support, they have yet to give me any help. All they say is that they will ""send it to their financial unit"". Honestly, the center does not seem to have any authority to do anything. I regret buying this ticket and I won't be flying with them again..."
Singapore Airlines,I've been trying to get missing miles…,1,"I've been trying to get missing miles added to my daughter's Singapore Airlines account since April. I've not been able to add them myself due to technical issues. Singapore Airlines customer services have been terrible. Initially they took weeks to reply to my email and now every time they reply they ask for me to provide the same information I've already provided (flight and passport details). I've been told that they have been added (they haven't), that they can't add them to my account and (not what I asked) but no one seems willing or able to help. I've asked multiple times for a manager's email so I can raise a complaint and they won't provide it."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines,1,"Singapore airlines, it is so difficult to talk to your call center employees."
Singapore Airlines,Avoid at all costs,1,"Avoid at all costs. Customer service is non existent. They will take your money but never give it back. Singapore Airlines should be ashamed for burning their reputation so badly. Will never book with them again. Someone should sue them, i'd be in."
Singapore Airlines,bad experience with call centre,1,"We have very bad experience with their outsourced call centre, issue still ongoing for 3days now and Singapore Airlines have not given us a definite solution.

Please can someone senior from local office contact us"
Singapore Airlines,Good customer service,5,"Hi everybody,

I just would like to say I had two long flights lately with Singapore airlines and I had amazing customer experience throughout the flights there was never a time I was not ask if I would like a drink or some food. It had good entertainment and I was well looked after with blankets and pillows.
Thanks air Singapore"
Singapore Airlines,Terrible customer service,1,"Terrible customer service after a poor flight experience that included delays that made me miss my train, incredibly uncomfortable seats, and no Wi-Fi despite paying for it.

I have been waiting two months for a response, and all I got were lame excuses for poor service and a conciliatory suggestion to accept air miles - not even a refund for the Wi-Fi I didn't receive or the train tickets I couldn't use as a result of their delay."
Singapore Airlines,The call centre is so so so bad,1,"The call centre is so so so bad. The worst I’ve ever experienced. They have out sourced it. I spoke to someone in the Phillipines. Truly awful. How can a supposedly good airline have such bad phone customer service? Had the misfortune of having to call them multiple times last few months. Kept me waiting ages, failed to resolve my minor issue, every call told me no manager was available, as well as many other issues. Dreadful dreadful dreadful."
Singapore Airlines,Great service Business class,5,"Travelling to Houston from Manchester. great welcome on board, always checking on me to see if I wanted anything else. food was great.
Even though crew were wearing a face mask, you could always see them smiling. very attentive."
Singapore Airlines,Virtually no customer service help,1,"Worse Customer service I have ever witnessed.
I booked a ticket, out business back economy. All was fine to begin with, however they decided to change my return flight from 30th August to the 15th ( with a 9hr 35m stop in Singapore), without telling me. I eventually got through to them by phone, here in Cambodia, only to be told that the schedule had changed, and there are no flights between the 30th and the 15th. I had already looked myself, and saw that there were several, at which point I was told that to go on 29th would be an additional £1000.
Was not happy and left the call, as was constantly put on hold and wasnt getting anywhere.
I then tried to pre book a seat on my Singapore to Heathrow leg, to no avail, so I had to call again.
This time I spoke to a lady called Nicky, and I offered to pay for an extra leg room seat. Said that she would call me back..... that was a week ago, and I am still waiting.
Absolute disgrace to treat frequent fliers this way."
Singapore Airlines,SIAA,5,"Singapore Airlines is the best airline in the world as of 2022 and is 5 stars according to Skytrax, a trusted airline and airport rating software and it is in the top 5 cleanest airlines to fly on during COVID. from check-in to landing the SIA cabin crew are understanding and will help you out. Singapore Airlines also is very efficient with their service and has a great safety video and makes sure their staff follow and take their procedures seriously."
Singapore Airlines,Missing luggages,1,"I'd been flew with SQ from 2007 and they always had great services.This time they changed my flight on 6/3/22 in the last minutes from New York-Singapore to New York-London-Singapore (longer flight while I paid premium price with short flight).Then when we arrived in London,the transit time only 1.5 hours with very long line.I brought 2 kids and run like crazy.From Singapore I bought separate ticket to Ho chi min from 6/5/22-6/9/22.I requested the SQ desk to transfer our 4 luggages to our next destination but all luggages never arrived.Our whole vacation was so messed without all our belongings!!!The day before we left Ho chi min they only can found 1 luggage.Then we have to continue our trip to Singapore for 2 days(6/9/22-6/11/22) and to Indonesia from 6/11/22-7/22/22.This whole trip was really bad experiences since we already had plans to visit many places like Bali,Lombok,and other domestic cities.How we can enjoy our vacation without our belongings and important medicine for my kids (which we can not buy without prescription)???So we canceled our trips and waited day by day in Surabaya.FYI SQ never offer me any compensation for delaying bag in the 1st place until we wanted to leave Ho chi min,they only offered $130 for 3 people.The 2 luggages they found on 6/14/22.The 4th bag the found 6/24/22.They NEVER offer me any additional compensation until I submitted 3 people's expenses receipt (around $600)while we're waiting these luggages.So disappointed they just wanted to force you to accept $308 and NEVER understand what we feel.Do you think your $308 can pay my vacation time that you ruined???The station manager in Ho chi min named Tresa Mok said the clothing you have bought have an on-going value and would continued to be used, we feel that a partial reimbursement on these items, which have residual value, is fair and reasonable. she even asked me to claim to travel insurance to get more compensation.This year I'm so disappointed with your services and you'll lost your faithful customer here.
PS:
Don’t bother to leave them any feedback since they will never reply anything to you."
Singapore Airlines,This is the worst experience that I…,1,"This is the worst experience that I have had with an airline after travelling with many carriers. They had made errors with my daughters ticket who was travelling and an infant under (2yrs) and returning as a child (over 2 yrs) . They issued incorrect tickets 5 times for my daughters outbound flight, which resulted in delays and eventually cancellation of the flight. On the inbound flight my daughters ticket, was also incorrect, which they said was resolved (travelling as a child), was registered as an infant by their partner (in crime) carrier Scoot. After 8hrs on the phone to 5+ customer reps, 2 managers my wife and child were not allowed to board the flight and currently stranded at the outbound airport for over 10 hours. The customer service is flawed, not genuine and use delay tactics like keeping people hanging on the phone, managers not being available to take ownership, for their incompetence. I will be taking this matter further and will never use this airline again. BE WARNED POTENTIAL TRAVELLERS!!!!!!!"
Singapore Airlines,Worst Airline re…,1,"The Airline refuses to disclose the value of the SUPPOSED REFUND.

I BELIEVE MOST AIRLINES AND TRAVEL AGENTS ARE COLLUDING TO DISADVANTAGE TRAVELLERS.
Worst Airline regarding communication and refund.
Airline confirmed refund had been authorised but after approximately 35 days my friend has not had his refund as yet despite the travel agent's supervisor Sarah, being advised, advising, she had request and the refund same from senior management (apparently Mr. Keith Lawson). When requested to speak to management and /or director Mr. Harmeej Singh Sethi, they are conveniently never available to take calls.
Beware this company is part of Travel Junction who is owned by above director under the company Flights and Holidays Uk Ltd at companies House.
It has been 29 days since airline confirmed directly with my friend that a refund had been authorised and made the Travel Agent aware of this a number of times. Have email proof and record of verbal calls made to following staff too with no joy, :
Ethan Amy, Christian, Stacey, Stella, and Hazel, so far.
Typical of most travel agents they grab your money for bookings but not quick to refund or negotiate a settlement of any sort.)
Have email proof.
AVOID THESE AIRLINE LIKE THE PLAGUE."
Singapore Airlines,Bad customer service,1,"Bad customer service, the company changes flight times multiple times for our flight from Singapore to Frankfurt.

I called the support center for reschedule our flight, I told him two dates we want to flight at with the two flights. After the call I received document and it was not correct. Called him again for making it correct, but he would not do it. He didn’t believed me and would like to check the record of the conversation. After his colleague heard the record I was correct and got the right flight times.
I have never tried so bad customer service and that kind of mistrust to customers.

I also ordered Gluten Free food for my Girlfriend, which he said was okay and done.
When we took the last flight yesterday from SIN to Frankfurt, there was no requested GF food. It was the worst service I have ever tried at a flight company.

Do not recommend this company for any people…."

I were in Singapore as an expatriate for almost 8 years and I have an emotional connection with the country and the people..so whenever possible I tried to choose SQ. But this is a good example how they treat the customers. Didn’t know SQ went down to this level, may be any other airline would be much better in this.."
Singapore Airlines,Great air crew - useless customer support,3,"The flights run on time, the air crew are attentive and polite.

They also have a relatively good website.

The thing that lets this airline down is its substandard customer support.

I fly lot and sometimes things out of the usual come up and as each airlines has its own set of rules, the only way to know if your travel is compliant is to ask.

Example - had a flight booked for work, camera crew were flying on same flight and we had to take camera batteries (which are Lithium Ion). Asked the airline through its web sites support and they took two weeks to answer. What? Why did we not phone and ask - we tried, the local phone support said they did not know and we needed to contact SA in Singapore. What? Which we tried and they said someone would call us back and guess what, we never heard from them.

Another example - had issues linking our Kris flyer membership miles from SA flight. Asked via the SA website and the response took about a week and was completely unhelpful. So gave up.

Singapore Airlines - you need to seriously up your game."
Singapore Airlines,really bad customer service. really bad customer experience,1,Bad service...Bad air planes...Bad information...Doesn't take criticism from their customers. Does not take into account and responsibility towards customers.. lies to customers. I was on holiday from Gothenburg to Perth/Australia. On the way back home I landed at Frankfurt airport where I was refused a boarding pass to continue to Landvetter airport. Bounced between Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines several times in various places around the airport where no one wanted to help me or care about me what soo ever. After 2 hours I managed to get my boarding pass after I showed my angry side bad customer service + that my flight to Gothenburg was 4 hours late DISASTER!!!!!!!! and Singapore Airlines is going to call itself the 1st airline in the world with ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🤢🤢🤢
Singapore Airlines,The worst customer service,1,"I booked the flight from Gothenburg to Perth this summer and experienced poor customer service and a helpless Singapore airline regarding my booking.
On 25 June, my first flight was delayed (SQ2189) from Gothenburg to Frankfurt, and I missed my connection flight from Frankfurt to Singapore and also missed my next connecting flight from Singapore to Perth,
 Singapore Airlines didn't take any responsibility and automatically sent a new ticket; I had to stay a night in Frankfort and talk to the service desk at Lufthansa and wait many hours to rebook a new flight; I had several phone calls to Singapore and didn't respond to anything and cost at least 160 euro.  
After 24 hours of stay in Frankfurt, I finally arrived in Perth on 27 June, one day after the expected ticket date.
When I arrived in Perth, Australia, I understood that my return booking was canceled by Singapore Airlines without any notification. I have many calls to Singapore Airlines to reverse my return ticket. Finally, they were successful in booking a flight. Still, they made another mistake and booked (SQ26) Frankfurt to Gothenburg with 24 hours time overlay, which requires me to take my luggage to the Frankfurt airport on 22 July, pay for the hotel and check in my luggage in the morning on 23 July. 
Singapore Airlines didn't pay for or book a hotel for me; I lost two days of my holiday in Frankfurt and had too much stress because of the mistake of Singapore Airlines.
Singapore Airlines is not a five-star airline,"
Singapore Airlines,My experience with Singapore Airlines,1,"Attempted to check in to flight SQ224 on 30/04/2022 for my flight to Bangkok, I was informed by the check in staff that I would be denied boarding because I did not have a pre departure PCR test.
I had extensively checked the details on both SIA and Thai embassy websites, the later stated that as from 1st April no PCR test required pre departure, despite this the staff insisted that this was to commence on 1st May, the information they had was 1 month out of date.
Had it not been for my insistence on talking to a supervisor and requesting him to check the Thai embassy site my holiday would have been completely ruined.
This prompts the question, how many other passengers were given this miss information and did not fly during the previous month?
I am in my seventies with a heart condition and this experience did not help it.
I would like to say that I have never before encountered this level of incomitance
at an airline check in.
I left feedback on SIA own site seven weeks ago and a follow up email two weeks ago with no response whatsoever.
A disgraceful lack of customer service, this used to be a top airline, sadly not any more."
Singapore Airlines,Terrible customer service,1,"Requested a refund for the part of the flight they cancelled and instead they refunded the whole trip and tried to charge me $4,000 re-book the flight as my initial ticket was 'no longer available and the refund request could not be stopped'. Staff were incredibly unhelpful and uncooperative. Now I'm stranded with no flight. Customer service has really gone down."
Singapore Airlines,Unreasonable and Unhelpful,1,"So how is this fair? I felt robbed, held by the neck to accept their unreasonable new timing. They cancelled my returned flight and force me to accept another date and time on a different flight. It totally disrupted my plans. Otherwise, they will be more than happy to refund me the initial amount I paid ( months in advanced) but not the value of the current tickets.
There's a reason why people take risk and book in advance in order to get cheaper tickets. Isn't this the game that the airlines are playing? Charging people for more as it gets closer to the departure date. Why aren't they honouring the value of the tickets now?

Why do customers have to top up ( in my case USD1300 ) to get back on the SAME flight. It isn't a cancellation, more like a change of time.

Stop playing tricks SIA.
SIA seemed to have lost their good faith, name integrity and good servivces along the years.

Also, they expect customers to call and wait on the line for ages to rectify SIA's own problem.


According to your customer service plan: this is what SIA pledged and FAILED to fulfill.

In the event that Singapore Airlines cancels, diverts or delays a flight, Singapore Airlines will, to the best of our ability, provide meals, accommodation, assistance in rebooking and transportation to the accommodation to mitigate inconveniences experienced by passengers resulting from such flight cancellations, delays and misconnections. Singapore Airlines will not be liable to carry out these mitigating efforts in cases where the flight cancellations, delays and misconnections arise due to factors beyond the airline’s control, for example, acts of God, acts of war, terrorism etc., but will do so on a best effort basis.

Think twice before buying from them. They are not what they used to be. Look elsewhere."
Singapore Airlines,Idk why the company has such a low rate…,4,"Idk why the company has such a low rate here, I fly every two weeks and never had a problem."
Singapore Airlines,Great customer service,5,"Received excellent customer service when trying to change a flight due to a cancellation. The customer service rep also noticed I didn’t have enough layover time between connecting flights so he also fixed that.
Very happy customer"
Singapore Airlines,Beware of their changes to your flight,1,"I booked a flight from Queenstown New Zealand to London Heathrow. I was notified by Singapore airlines of a change to my flight from Auckland to Singapore. The new flight meant that my flight from Queenstown to Auckland would now arrive after my new flight from Auckland to Singapore departed. I contacted customer services an after more than an hour on the phone they managed to sort out a flight from Auckland to Singapore the following day but refused to move my flight from Queenstown to Auckland to match. My alternative was to cancel the trip or book the same trip a day later at a cost of £2,500 extra. What has happened to Singapore Airlines they used to b so good. I will not book with them ever again."
Singapore Airlines,What has happened to your service.....,1,"I have used singopore airlines to fly across south asia to many destinations, and before the pandemic found the service to be great.
However since flying with them again after the pandemic i do not think i will fly again with them .
Their food has become awful, there customer service is ridiculous and the overall services lack any due care and attention.
So much so that they lost our luagge suring transition wgen we started our holiday, down to serving me just bread for a meal. As they had run out of meals.

I showed up to the airport saying that our flight was tickets cancelled . On the app it says ticket and reAdy. We called and they said no one was in the office. We missed our flight to Singapore.

This is the most garbage company. Nobody could help us they said email. The email says 15 days before response.

You ruined my honeymoon and my life."
Singapore Airlines,I flew SQ308 to London business class,1,"I flew SQ308 to London business class. Terrible. The headphones given were dirty and sticky. The surrounding area of screen was dusty layered with dust. I ordered iLly coffee from menu and they don’t have, asked for a wet towel, they don’t have. Not once did a steward come and ask if everything was ok, entertainment system wanted to listen to podcast, not available. To sum up, was terrible. I wouldn’t fly SQ again. Went from The best to one of the worst."
Singapore Airlines,Left passenger stranded,1,"I booked a redemption ticket on Booking Ref Number: ""5TQYAG"" on flight UA61 and UA2324 on 2nd June 2022 MEL-EWR and when we arrived at the airport, there was no such flight. SIA never informed us of the cancellation. Later when i researched into flight history, this flight never existed. It was never meant to fly that day. They knew it but did not inform us. We did pre-departure covid19 tests and hired taxis and incurred costs. They never bothered to even help put us on the next available flight although there many available flights. Many calls (hours) to SIA office, and two visits to the SIA office (Melb airport) but still no help. All they said was SORRY it was their mistake and they ACCEPT THE MISTAKE and they will refund the money. That's all. We were left stranded having to buy last minute tickets (expensive) with no compensation for the mistake made by SIA. Very disappointed on how SIA handled the situation :-("
Singapore Airlines,Conned by Singapore airline,1,"Conned by Singapore airline. I am very scared of flying and I always try to use a Singapore airline otherwise I will have a panic attack but my flight was changed to an Indonesian flight without letting me know they will change the airline. On top of it, the flight number was still with SQ……I believe that Singapore airline was a decent company but I was so shocked that they do trick customers."
Singapore Airlines,Used to be great… now just scammers,1,"Singapore airlines used to be a great airline you could trust, now they are nothing but scammers. We booked flights in the official singapore airline website and got SQ flight numbers. Turned up at the airport and we were apparently in an Indonesian cheap airline. Called services who were zero help at all. We could of booked that crap airline for half the price. It was nothing but a disgraceful scam. Be very careful with this awful airline, they are full of tricks"
Singapore Airlines,Robbed!,1,"Wanted a refund for my first leg of the journey as was denied boarding due to my partner being sick. Not the second leg as we rebooked the first and were going home on the second leg flights. Without stating that they could only refund both (why is beyond me), they fully took our tickets and gave us a PARTIAL refund. We called to get our tickets back and were told we would have to pay aud $2400 to get back home (we had already left Australia). We have been on to customer service for HOURS and have gotten no where. Can’t believe an airline can rob people and get away with it!!"
Singapore Airlines,Don’t know why people are complaining…,5,"Don’t know why people are complaining about Singapore Airlines. The food we were given in economy was as good if not better than any other airline we have flown with from UK to Australia, and the service friendly and efficient. And they have just looked after us brilliantly after we missed our connection in Changi, booking us to travel to Australia the following day and putting us up in a hotel free of charge. Highly - highly - recommended."
Singapore Airlines,A waste of money for Premium Economy…,1,"We flew Premium Economy Akl-Sing-Amsterdam departing Akl on 28 May at 11.15 am. It was our first experience in Premium Economy and we were bitterly disappointed. The meal was the same as economy, with plastic cutlery and a disgusting, lukewarm pasta and cheese. This was like eating paste with a bit of watery tomato sauce at one end of the plastic tray.. couldn't detect any cheese! We got plastic cutlery, with no special touches at all.
The meal was almost thrown at us, and tea or coffee was offered at the same time as the wine. The tea was cold and we were not offered any more wine. In fact we didn't see the crew again after the meal service."
Singapore Airlines,June 14 flight Singapore - Cebu return,2,"Our flight from Heathrow to Singapore the foods are not good for 2 meals
The scoot airlines are being used to carry us to Cebu which is small not a jet plane.
On our return it's a bit advantage because we are using a small jet plane Cebu to Singapore and just wondering since so many British passenger on that time on our flight Singapore to Heathrow that's the time good foods are being served and with snacks."
Singapore Airlines,They lied!!!,1,"I am flying london-Singapore-Macau, macau-Singapore-london. The flight from macau to Singapore has been rescheduled to a later time that causing me to miss the connecting flight to london on the same day. They have not informed me about any change at all, i only found out about this few days before my departure when I contacted them since I couldn’t manage my booking on their website and the app. The representative asked me to confirm that I agree to take the connecting flight on the next day, meaning I have to wait 9 hours at the airport. I have asked for a compensation, as this has affected my trip and I wouldn’t have purchased these flight tickets if I knew that I would have to wait 9 hours for the connecting flight, the representative said I could refund all the tickets and buy a new one just few days before I depart from london. If I were to do this, flight ticket would have been way more expensive, Singapore airline was leaving me no option.

At the end they agreed to provide hotel accommodation free of charge for me to wait for the connecting flight at the airport, I was told that another team will contact me to arrange this. But I received no update so I chased, they said someone would contact me closer to my departure from macau, now I am chasing again as I am departing in 2 weeks, the final response I got is that they do not provide free accommodation!!! I can’t believe they lied to me!!! Hopefully I can get a response by making this review, as the live chat of Singapore airline is not responding at all."
Singapore Airlines,The worst customer service of any…,1,"The worst customer service of any airline I have experienced. They are allegedly a 5 star airline. Maybe inflight however this rating should be across all aspects of the customer experience. Useless agents who promise you call backs and never do, during the latter stages of the pandemic awful wait times (once held for 7 hours) and overall a completely shambolic operation. I don’t understand how management are allowing this to happen. Really disappointed. 30-40 calls over 6 months and still no resolution to my issue. Take your business elsewhere, it will be better spent."
Singapore Airlines,no way can get touch with them,1,"in last few days i can not make rebooking online, i have tryed call your head office for over 50mints but not answer,i try send message PPS and spend hours wait on line livecheat not amswer.i have keep sending email also no respond.i Wondering what's going on with your airway?
I'm desperate but no way can get help Looks pay for the ticket Money will be disappear."
Singapore Airlines,Best service,5,Best comfort and safety
Singapore Airlines,"Poorest of the poorest service, worst of all the worst",1,"If I can rate Singapore Airlines, I would give it below negative. It is the worst airline I have ever come across with. There is no worse word than worst to describe how disgusting their service is. They upset me from start to finish. Not only your staff are not very helpful, I find them rude as well. I have never been let down like this!!!!!! I am so upset!!!!

First of all, I have used the mobile web check-in. I thought it will be a breeze to drop my luggage (as per my experience with other airlines) and have ample time to have a meal with my family before heading to the immigration clearance but it did not happen because your ground staff were so inefficient, unorganized, too slow and not proactive!!!! I waited for a couple of hours on a short line just to drop my bag! How ridiculous!!!!! And so I missed that time I could have spent with my family who I have just seen once in 3 years due to the pandemic!!!!!!

There was a 2 hour flight delay due to their technical issue. They have offered passengers to come forward should they need help because of that inconvenience. I asked them to sort out my coach as I missed it. I was promised that the staff in London will help me but no one did. They should not offer if they cannot do anything. They try to make a fool of you and waste your time. I paid for my onward travel twice and paid more for taxi even it was their fault. I chose that flight time so I can arrive to my place before the wee hours, catch public transport and rest early as I have been traveling straight from point A to point B nonstop for 2 days and got to go to work the following day but I came home in unruly hour of the day because of their fault and it was unsafe for a solo traveler like me! They wasted so much of my time as I have to wait as well for the next available coach all due their plane not being ready and safe for their passengers. I appreciate they want to ensure that all of the passengers are safe, but that is the bare minimum all airlines should do!!!!! They should have ensured the plane is safe and ready before the scheduled departure!!!!!

I definitely was not looked after at least to a decent level of service in flight. I only asked for a can of Sprite but the cabin crew never returned to me but she had been serving one white passenger unlimited drinks as if he was in a bar. To my disappointment, I just went to sleep. How can you allow your passenger go dehydrated in such a long haul flight? One of my friends in the UK, did not recommend me using Singapore airlines; I should have listened.

Their apology is so insincere and they really do not mind the inconvenience they cause your customers!!! I will make sure everyone I know never uses Singapore Airlines services as I do not want them to experience what I had. Extremely terrible company! They better shut down."
Singapore Airlines,The flights are great but good luck…,1,"The flights are great but good luck with customer service! Lethargic and customer service knows nothing about their own policies and procedures, and, will only stick to a script like a robot"
Singapore Airlines,Blessing.,5,"After terrible experience with SAS, Singapore Airlines was like heaven.
I've struggle a lot- bought flight the wrong day, booked the wrong seats...
* On their app it was No problem wha so ever to rebook to another flight
* When l made a call l came to a wonderful Swedish lady who helped patiently to have the correct seats tha l wanted and have paid 4."
Singapore Airlines,DO NOT TRAVEL WITH THIS COMPANY,1,"DO NOT TRAVEL WITH THIS COMPANY! I've been waiting for a hotel refund (because they changed our flight to 20 hours later), for more than 6 months. Now, they have decided to not answer my emails anymore. It's impossible to reach them on the customer service chat, and no phone number. I will never choose this unfaithful company again"
Singapore Airlines,Terrible Services & Rude Incompetent…,1,"Your employees at Perth International Airport T1 made us all lined up like cows for a freaking 2 hours just for baggage check-in earlier today (9/6/2022 - Perth to Singapore - 1:00am - SQ216). Very slow service and incompetent. Particular personnel named “gerald” or something, surely from Indian descend was a making rude remarks and hateful/racial profiling behaviour towards me and several other passengers during the late manual check-in we need to undergo (due to your staffs incompetencies) instead of helping and assisting on matters that we as customers were facing. His bad behaviour and he himself made your airlines looked like a lesser 3rd world country’s airline services.
SQ Management, you need to do something about this or you are going to lose more people like me. A regular flyer. A business traveler. Well you lost me already after this morning incident. Make sure you don’t lost more.

Regards."
Singapore Airlines,Dishonest business practice,1,"Dishonest business practice: SIA reduced frequency of flight from SGN to Houston (IAH) from 7 to 4 weekly but only shows unavailable on their schedule to avoid cancellation refund for previous bookings. The return flight is then cancel closer the travel date, forcing you to buy a more expensive fare if you want to get home. Singapore Airline is destroying its name. Do not fly or book on SIA if you want to avoid headache."
Singapore Airlines,Terrible experience,1,"I flew from Singapore to Melbourne, Australia on 25th May SQ 237. Firstly, the cabin attendant didn't help me find a spot for my small backpack and sleep apnea machine (in a small attache case). He simply stood there and told me to put it all under the seat in front of me. Well - there's no room is there? I found some spots to put my stuff amongst the grand pianos and freezers stored up there.
After take off, the lights were not turned back on. There was no service, no meals, no anything. I thought they served a supper? No - we had to wait until early morning Australian time to get a meal and that in itself was very disappointing.
During the long 7 hour flight overnight, crammed into a tigher space that ever I had no choice but to press the call button and request....well...something to eat and drink as I was quite famished and dehydrated to say the least. I got a coffee which was like water and I has to call them AGAIN to get some sugar and a toothpick size wooden stirrer! In the day, they would serve a coffee with a spoon and sugar on a little tray. Not Singapore Airlines. The staff in general were not friendly at all - and wearing a mask throughout the flight was a nuicence - however, the main problem for me is that I have a hearing loss and could not undertand ONE word of what they say. There was no written menu, covid or no covid they NEED to accomodate persons who are deaf.
Lastly, the old B77-300ER is getting a bit long in the tooth. The plane is OLD. When I took the mask off to drink a tiny cup of water (maybe a minute later) I was yelled at and gestured to PUT MY MASK BACK ON by the attendant. When I took off my mask to drink water, the AIR inside the aircraft smelled dank and moldy. Hence I caught a sinus and respiratory infection which required antibiotics.
Once they were an excellent airline, but now they are not good at all. I will be reluctant to book with this airline ever again. If the excuses are ""due to covid"" then I think it has been taken TOO FAR."
Singapore Airlines,Great airline,5,Great airline. We requested for refund as japan is still not open and they promptly agreed. Same for our kl flight in Jan 2022 this year. Helpful website and customer service too. Keep it up sq!
Singapore Airlines,DIRTY PRACTICE OF SINGAPORE AIRLINE,1,"I reserved 2 tickets from Singapore Airlines 6 months ahead of my journey in view of getting a good price. In Mach, Prices started going up and Airline changed my dates. As a result, I had to book a hotel this time since the layover is more than 36 Hrs. Again, on 31 may Airline stated my dates need to be changed. This time the layover in both directions was 3 days each. For hotels whatever I paid were non-refundable and I lost money more than the ticket prices. When the ticket prices go up, Airline does this dirty game and tries to refund the money by discouraging you, in order to sell it at a higher price. This should be stopped as a reputed business."
Singapore Airlines,Horrible Landing,1,"This morning l took a flight SQ708 to Bangkok. Upon reaching Bangkok international airport, the pilot suddenly drop the whole plane for landing. Gosh!, this my first time experience that shock me when about to landing. Hope the management look into this pilot performance."
Singapore Airlines,They lost a luggage no one answer the…,1,They lost a luggage no one answer the phone. No informations. Never happened to me with other companies. I bought a Business class ticket economy with emirates is better
Singapore Airlines,Horrible,1,"Horrible, poor customer service, system glitches, waste of time, poor service, repenting even before the travel has started, that I have even booked a ticket. Worst thing is I went business class, waste of money."
Singapore Airlines,Please work on your website although…,3,Please work on your website although their customer service were helpful and i got my refund.
Singapore Airlines,CS is terrible from Singapore airlines NEVER AGAIN,1,"Tried to call the CS since they changed our flight, this wasnt possible. we tried for 3 days to contact even wrote an email. no reaction. So we excepted the change no choice. Than they lost our baggage in Cebu 1 suitcase. A lot of hassle to get it back because, of course cant reach the cs, and went back to the airport to collect the bag, which costed us a whole day. At the returning flight we made a mistake and had 4kg from the 70 overweight. we tried to ask to exchange of the bags to handcarry, but the belt already put it away. So only option take out or pay. So we asked to make an exception because of the inconvenience from the lost of the suitcase first day and without a blink the reaction was call cs if you want to complain. So we paid 180euro to continue.. They flight itself was oke, but Never again to travel with singapore."
Singapore Airlines,No customer service in USA + refund takes long + can't book new tickets interim,1,"Booked ticket on singapore airlines website in USA which had 1 hr of layover and 17 hr and 6 hr of flight schedule from Sea to Amd. Since travelling with infant, me and my wife decided to contact customer service and change the schedule. I could not contact them so I filed a cancellation ticket form on singapore airline website. Its been more than 2 months and I have not received refund. I could not contact customer service in USA so I asked my family to contact from India and which they were able to. Promises made but I dont see results from their end. I tried to book new tickets but their system is blocking me and now ticket prices have doubled."
Singapore Airlines,USELESS & FALSE ADVERTISING,1,"It's become quite clear over the last year that up in the skies Singapore Airlines is a force to be reckoned with. But on the ground it's painfully woefully bad.

The issue - So, via the krisflyer site it states that you can earn Krisflyer points on the ground via Agoda using a specific link. It states that EVERY hotel booking is rewarded. This does not happen. I've made multiple bookings and spent over a thousand pounds on hotel bookings to never be rewarded.

I raised the issue Singapore Airlines at the end of last year and sent over the evidence of my stays. Showing screenshots of my complete Agoda bookings wasn't enough, they wanted bank statements too. It's lovely that they don't trust me, when they're happy to fabricate on their website.

Since making the claim, more than 6 months ago. I've had one email. When I've called and told that someone would be in contact. That's never, ever, ever happened.
On the 27th of May I contacted their customer services and asked to speak to a supervisor and to make a complaint. Well the request to make a complaint was ignored and I was advised that a supervisor would be in contact within 24hrs. I joked with agent that that was unlikely to happen. It's now the 30th of May and no one from Singapore Airlines has called.

You, Singapore Airlines are SHOCKING!!, SHOCKING. If I had known you were so USELESS! i wouldn't have wasted my money and time trying to get KRISFLYER points."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines rip off merchants,1,"Tried to reschedule flight on the 19th may 2022 original flight 23rd to the 6 June because of medical emergency of spouse given unfit to fly, still waiting for a response from Singapore Airlines doubt they will even bother to contact no way to contact or escalate , finally managed to initiate a chat response only to have it drop out or was cut off by representative as got to hard to fix reschedule cost excessive not worth the effort and will no longer use Singapore airlines as a carrier because of poor customer service response just leaves people out to dry or rip off because they can with no recourse, customer service is based on how to resolve an issue fairly not ignore it and make it difficult for customers to contact you."
Singapore Airlines,NOT WORTH IT FLY WITH SOMEONE ELSE,1,Do not waste your money and time with singapore airlines. Our first family holiday get so stressful before even start. Their website won't let me buy a seat for my little one who is under 2 years old so called customer service who try to charge $350 more than what their website shows!! When I asked why there is a gap answer was they are using different system. What a BS!!! The ticket price was same for another week and made a complain by email and numerous calls to customer service( who does nothing) no luck!!! after a month of purchase my tickets still not able to get a response from them try to talk a manager and wait 2.5 hours on the phone no luck so far total of 7 hours on the line. Company don't have a manager?? Can't afford to hire more??? Charging good enough. Some reason they are always busy!!!Still trying to fix and buy a seat but I don't I will be able too. Anyway I would not recommend anyone to fly with them. It will be our first and last time using this company. I don't know who gave that stars and awards they don't deserve it!! hopeless!!! Update your system and train your staff!!! Hire more managers!!! Disappointed
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines customer service and…,1,"Singapore Airlines customer service and complimentary rebooking service during covid IS a scam… Despite saying it’s complimentary, I have been charged large amounts of price difference during the times I’ve had to rebook during covid. My original ticket from New York to Jakarta costed $1500. I have been charged an extra $800 under the guise of complimentary rebooking and was not allowed a refund… Their customer service has called me a liar and gaslit my experience with them. They’ve show zero empathy towards me and I’m sure to many other customers during the pandemic."
Singapore Airlines,Travelled business class (A350-900)…,3,"Travelled business class (A350-900) AMS-BKK. Really excited to travel on a premium airline in business. The seat was disappointing, the flatbed function had to be operated by standing up and releasing a catch at the top of the seat. There’s a narrow hole angled to the right to place feet when sleeping, that suits side sleepers. Honestly far inferior to the seats offered on most Middle Eastern airlines.
Food; presentation was poor and taste was unimpressive, wine selection laughably small.
Service ; pleasant and polite, although the sector SIN to BKk was distant and perfunctory.
Business Lounge Changi; packed & uncomfortable at 6am after a long flight. Ok there are works going on at the airport but this was the low point of the travel experience.
Overall I’m not sure if I would ever choose to fly with SIA again as the seat is not to an acceptable standard at this price point."
Singapore Airlines,horrible customer service,1,"We couldn't board the flight because I tested positive for Covid pre-flight. The rebooking process was a nightmare. We called their customer service so many times, each time almost an hour of waiting and talking. They always promised to follow up after a manual fee calculation has been done. But they never called, and the whole process repeats itself again and again like in a horror movie. In my last call, the lady was very rude, so I have to write this review to let people know that Singapore airline is not what it used to be."
Singapore Airlines,"Customer ""service""",1,"We have purchased refundable tickets, but when trying to get the refund, we receive NO reply. We have used their online forms to create contact, we have sent severals emails and made several phone calls, but simply NO reply from Singapore Airlines' side.
Very difficult to work with. Not recommendable."
Singapore Airlines,Flight SQ 322 Singapore to London,1,"Flight SQ 322 Singapore to London
Premier economy class Airbus A380
May 15th 2022. 2330 departure time.
After a 2 hour delay on take off, we had been in the aircraft for 3 hours. Dinner was served. However the meals trays were left for 45 minutes after completion of the meal service. Preventing passengers being able to try to settle for sleep or use the bathrooms. The cabin crew seemed oblivious of this need. Passengers were using call bells to urge the cabin crew to clear the trays.
What has happened to turn Singapore airlines from one of the best to being mediocre? Very dissatisfied with both my long haul flight experiences with Singapore. Emirates would be a better option for cabin service."
Singapore Airlines,Customer service collapse,1,"Website poor and customer-service reps, when you can get through, are clueless and clearly hamstrung by IT issues. A sad state of affairs for what was once a premium airline. I will be avoiding SQ whenever possible."
Singapore Airlines,Service is getting worse,1,"Service is getting worse after the reopening, compared to pre pandemic and during the closed period. Disappointing."
Singapore Airlines,Unreachable customer service,1,"I have decided to fly with SIA for their well-known excellent customer service as stated on their website as well. However, the service is already disappointing before my departure date. I would like to make some changes to my trip which can’t be done on their subpar website and for 3 weeks now, I couldn’t reach out to anyone from the airline. There is no one replying to the messages( I sent a couple over the past weeks) , forever on que chatbot, phone line that cannot be reached because they have updated their PIN system to password on the internet but not on their phone system. The automated phone system is asking for a PIN that I don’t have, and there is no other option to talk to someone or anyone from SIA. I just found so many complaints and negative feedbacks online, I am now deeply regret for my decision to fly with them for my upcoming trip."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines service has dropped…,1,"Singapore Airlines service has dropped a lot. They no longer deserve their reputation. I am PPS status, which is higher than Gold. You can only get that status flying business class or above. Lately, I could not even reach them by phone. The number doesn't even pick up, it hangs... Their website and App are substandard compare to what is done in the market. For example, you can't redeem a fligth if one leg of the flight is done by a star alliance member, which singapore airline is part of.
They have regroup all the class into the same lounge at Changi airport. No more difference whether you fly eco or business. It's a big mess and the food choice and quality is now average. Their fares which were already among the highest have increased further. And their mileage point system is almost impossible to use. I just tried to book for 3 people for a trip to Europe in 4 months and unless I pay double the miles, there is already no seats..."
Singapore Airlines,The worst StarAlliance airline I’ve ever flown,1,"StarAlliance Gold Member and frequent traveler: this is by far the worst airline I’ve interacted with across the fleet. The site/app are borderline unusable: painfully slow, frequently time out, and don’t generate an itinerary matched to your booking. If you do manage to book, the airline provides minimal info and the checkin experience is such a black hole that I arrived at SFO not totally clear if I’d actually be allowed to board a flight to Singapore. When I needed to try to change my return flight due a personal emergency, I was not allowed to do so via the app or website and was instead directed to their phone line. Spent 8 hours on hold. Multiple agents hung up on me. Eventually was told there was nothing they could do for me and that I had no alternative flights available in the next 4 days. Even by airline customer service standards, this was highly dismissive. If you have alternative airline options, highly recommend taking them instead"
Singapore Airlines,I had thought it was not possible to…,1,"I had thought it was not possible to have a worse call centre experience than Foxtel. I was wrong. Singapore Airlines was happy to correct me. I made three calls over three hours, to change a reward booking. First failed because the agent finally said she couldn’t actually execute a reward booking, and couldn’t contact anyone who could. The second because the agent said she had no way to identify the replacement flight that I wanted. I knew city and date, but not flight number. The third, after half an hour, finally realised that I was dealing with a redemptions booking and again said she had no authority or ability to deal with it. It appears that whatever button you press on the menu on the way in, after about 45mins on hold it just puts you to the general staff."
Singapore Airlines,Terrible service. No communication. Do not fly,1,"Terrible service, the worst I have ever received. They cancelled our flight and didn't automatically book 1 on the same date. They just left it for us to sort out. Gave them a flight number on the same date and they ""submitted it for approval"" - 9 days later and 6 phone calls and they say now there is no seats available. I was told they would call and email multiple times. No communication at all.

They told us they could just cancel and refund our flight. It was booked 12 months ago and if we were to book now the flights are nearly triple the cost.

Do not fly Singapore Airlines. Horrible experience"
Singapore Airlines,Terrible customer service!,2,"Terrible customer service!
I had to cancel my flight, because of some personal issue. I tried to connect the customer support for 3 days, without success. There was a no show on the flight, and they should understand that, i need someone to talk when i have a problem with my flight. Now what? the ticket and money has been lost and waste, only because your customer support is terrible and not responsible???"
Singapore Airlines,Very serious!,5,Unfortunately I didn't travel with them because I had to cancel my flight for personal reasons. Despite this the customer care was very helpful and they refund my ticket in few days.
Singapore Airlines,Seriously such a bad customer service…,1,"Seriously such a bad customer service singapore airline providing at the moment. I have a credit for my mum's ticket from India to Australia, and we want to buy a new ticket, we called so many times, the wait is so so soo long, and finally when it's your turn, the staff who attend you are so dumb that they can not understand at all that what are you talking about for such long time, you seriously spend more than 4 hours on the phone and at the end there is no outcome. When you say that you want to book the ticket and want to use the credit, they book the ticket without telling you the price and ask you to wait 3 days that someone will call you after manual calculations. Then even after 4-5 days no one call you and when you call them again, they say that the last person did not forward anything so there is no seat left for that date. Then you again book the ticket with them and wait, then no one contact you. Moreover, they say we only book the ticket we can not lock the price, so when you get the call from the department fer manual calculations, you have to pay the amount whatever the ticket price the same day which is a scam, as they wait so long to call you back as they wait for the ticket price to go so high.

So far no one has contacted us, this is the third time same happening each time. So frustrated and annoyed that I feel so helpless. Shame on you @SINGAPORE AIRLINE"
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Air customer service nightmare,1,Singapore Air customer service became a nightmare since Covid. They need 6 to 8 weeks to reply to emails and hours by phone. If you have any problems before fly it will never be solved before needed. I personally wrote to the French Marketing Director Franklin Auber because I lost many miles because of the customer service not replying on time. I flying business class so it's a big loss and after a regular response from him to introduce me to the customer service I just get nothing. I wrote many times but they just ignore me like they don't care. Singapore Air is not like before best business class and it's a pity. If you see about price in business class now nearly double it's so disappointing and I think to fly with another air company now.
Singapore Airlines,What ever happened to Singapore…,3,"What ever happened to Singapore Airlines??
Just completed a long haul Economy Flight with Singapore Airlines via Changi into LHR
Flight was busy,
Cabin crew were excellent
Food was really dire, limited or no choice, breakfast was the same as dinner - chicken and noodles.
Staff at Transfer desk in Changi were awful, stone faced and completely and disinterested.
Changi was virtually closed - apart from duty free - at 10.00pm local.
Not my choice of airline it was an unrequested transfer from Qantas.
Won't be choosing Singapore airlines any time soon"
Singapore Airlines,33 hours on hold waiting for terrible customer service,1,"My family and I have flight credits for an unused pre-covid return flight from Auckland to Copenhagen and we are trying to book that along with a new flight back to NZ from Copenhagen in July. I have spent a total of 33hrs(yes, 33!) trying to get hold of Singapore Airlines over the past 7 weeks (I am currently listening to the wonderful waiting tune having been on hold for 1 hour and 38 minutes). I succeeded twice in getting through to an agent. Both times they apologised profusely and I was promised a call back within 48hrs. I have never received those call backs. The last person was a Mary Jane at the Singapore Office, who said, that she would always keep a promise and guaranteed me a call back. Both times I was told that they could not give me a figure on the outstanding ticket value, or the price for the new tickets, which we were booked on on April 6th 2022. This had to be done manually and would take 24-48hrs.
I have previously flown with SingaporeAir, and I do appreciate how tough it has been for the industry. I have always been happy to pay the premium for their service, but they seem to be an absolute mess now, and, unless you fly business or higher, I would definitely consider flying with someone else!"
Singapore Airlines,Worst experience ever,1,Worst experience ever. Stuck in Kuala Lumpur for more than 12 hours due to technical issues with them plane. Very little transparency on what is going on. No food. No water (after one initial cup). No blankets. No nothing. Staff totally overwhelmed and unable to deal with the situation. Catastrophic.
Singapore Airlines,Today I booked with SingaporeAir for my…,5,"Today I booked with SingaporeAir for my first time.
The Agent was very nice and helpful.
He also took his time and was not in a rush to get the booking done, He suggested stuff I could use and answered all
My questions. If he was unsure of the answer he actually went and asked. He was Very Honest.
I would highly recommend calling in for your next trip that you need to fly out to western part of the world 🌎.
Plus he saved me money for my trip to the Philippines."
Singapore Airlines,I feel like ive been robbed,1,"I feel like ive been robbed ! Non existant customer service ,on hold for over 2 hours.Tried changing my return leg of a business flight from Singapore to Amsterdam,they wanted 1800 euros !!! No option but to cancel and received a refund of 26 euros.Spent my hard earned cash with Ethiad to take me home.Im disgusted at the way you treat your customers Singapore Airlines !!!"
Singapore Airlines,Horrible on board experience,1,Horrible on board experience. There was no Vegetarian meals on board. The passenger was not served any meals on a 8 hour long flight due to being Vegetarian. Despite the Airlines being informed of this in advance. The staff named Anne at Transfer Desk A at Changi International Airport was also very unhelpful and rude
Singapore Airlines,Amsterdam-Bangkok via Singapore.,5,"Amsterdam-Bangkok via Singapore.
No pre-meal drink service and no appetizer, for the rest as good as it used to be before corona.
Booking direct on the website of the airline is the cheapest and best option."
Singapore Airlines,"Lovely, Nice new planes",5,"Lovely. Great check in. Beautiful NEW and CLEAN planes. Excellent cabin crew. Great food, drinks and entertainment and overall comfort."
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines are required to…,1,"Singapore airlines are required to reimburse me for a flight.

8 phones calls later, waiting 2 hours each to connect, around 15 hours of total phone calls, I am no closer to getting my reimbursement. They deleted the notes from my account and I have to explain each time I call. They had me jumoing through hoops to give them al sorts of random documentation and still I am no closer to get my money back.

They are literally stealing from me. I have always flown emirates and never had a problem. However I though I would try singapore due to thier reputation. Don't put yourself through this. Do not use singapore airlines They are all usless. Once they have your money you are shafted"
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines do not follow the law,1,Singapore Airlines cancelled my families flight several months ago and have refused to rebook or compensate the fare difference for new tickets despite legal obligation under EU261 to do so. They are not responding to support email and are completely non-respondent on other channels. They still have the money.
Singapore Airlines,I’d rather fly Turkish airline which says it all.,2,"Worst thing I’ve every experienced in my 15 years of traveling!
Service no better than a street vendor who has given up on people and life. Had an infant under 2 years. Got a window seat and no bassinet for a 12 hour flight. Got 1 meal to share between us. So I had to go hungry. A side from that getting any other info spicific for my flight was impossible. Was trying to figure out how much luggage I could have on my daughters ticket. Which wasn’t specified anywhere not even on the ticket. It said contact the airline. So I tried that but to contact them directly you can’t. Unless you become a vip member or something like that. All in all I’d rather fly Turkish airline they at least care about kids wellbeing. 2 stars because they got us from a to b all things concidered. I know the staff isn’t to blame for this. but I didn’t like the 15min. Wait for a cup of water for a crying baby. Or have to ask 4 time for your meal."
Singapore Airlines,Great airline,5,"Most comfy economy seats for long haul flights, great service on board. No fuss with surfboards as you might get with other airlines…). Thanks 🙏"
Singapore Airlines,Day 2 of nightmare,1,"Day 2 of nightmare. Made 3 calls to reach agent. First 2 calls over 50mins each. Third one 1 hour and 20 minutes. No one has picked up yet. On to my 4th call now. Unless Singapore airlines has one agent serving the whole planet, there is no other explanation for this abysmal service. I would like to give a negative 5 star rating."
Singapore Airlines,"Deceitful Emails, poor website and an okay flight.",1,"Received several deceitful emails from Singapore Airlines urging me to convert my Krisflyer points into 'krispay' points, in order to 'redeem' the points.
This leads you to a glorified online gift card shop for Singapore residents only, designed to relieve Singapore Airlines the bother of giving you a free flight for your loyalty.

Also, anyone who has used the website will know it borders on unusable the majority of the time.

My flights with them have been not great, not bad - fine."
Singapore Airlines,Fantastic,5,"Spoke to Evi in Customer Services at Heathrow.

Evi was polite, knowledgeable, professional and dealt with all of my numerous queries with no fuss.

An absolute credit to your company."
Singapore Airlines,Disappointing Singapore Airlines experience,1,Charged me $1500 to push my economy flight by a week despite the T&Cs at the time of booking claiming that flights could be changed free of charge. The SA loop hole is that they removed the economy tier I had originally booked out so was forced to pay the inflated new economy rates. I had also paid for 3 extra legroom seats and for every leg of the journey they have kicked me off those seats and I am still yet to get a refund from the first one almost five weeks later. It's years since I've flown with Singapore Airlines and this experience has put me off ever flying with them again.
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Air has deleted our booking…,1,"Singapore Air has cancelled our flights and deleted our booking without our knowledge and also without accomodating us in suitable flights. Also, they offered flights having 24 hrs delay in singapore without any accomodation and meals. I will not recommend to buy services from Singapore air if you have any other options with slight high price."
Singapore Airlines,Hi. Great experience.,5,"Hi, here is what happened in my flight of March 30 from Singapore to Munich. There was no vegetarian meal and I found out it was the agency's fault that didn't send the information to the airline company. The flight attendant named Tan came to me and apologized so many times, even though it was not Singapore Airlines's fault.

Tan was so helpful and nice to me, he treated me like his most valued customer. About the vegetarian meals, he found a way to give me two of them and they were very good.

Last but not least, I received an email and got a voucher (for about 50 euros) because of what happened with the meals.

I am very thankful and will travel with Singapore Airlines again for sure."
Singapore Airlines,Narayan and Kam were excellent…,5,Narayan and Kam were excellent brilliant service smooth check-in flight SQ305 4th April. They are both a credit to your company
Singapore Airlines,Singapore airlines in its lowest Low,1,"Singapore airlines in its lowest Low. The management better take this seriously.
The customer service run by a call centre out in Philippines. No one know what they are doing. The protocol is loose and they cannot even help. Me, being a proud Singaporean is embarrassed of our national airline. All I want is an upgrade or to change flights and there is no way for me to do it."
Singapore Airlines,Waiting in the customer support call…,2,"Waiting in the customer support call line for 45 min without any indication of waiting time... very frustrating... Implement ""Expected waiting time of X"" or just staff more people it's that simple.. bad user experience"
Singapore Airlines,3 months and still no refund,1,"Awful experience. We had to cancel our fights to New Zealand due to delays in the border opening.
Singapore airlines offered us a refund which was seemingly great. However 3 months on we are still waiting for our money (almost £3000).
The Krisbot is beyond useless, and we have spent almost 24 hours now on hold during various phone calls, during which we are always promised a supervisor will call us back, which they have so far not done.
Disgusting customer service and feeling extremely let down"
Singapore Airlines,Phone support puts you on hold for…,1,Phone support puts you on hold for hours :-( Ranked #2 airline in world can't believe this!
Singapore Airlines,I have never experienced such bad service,1,"I have never experienced such bad customer support ever for any other service, ever. Avoid giving these guys your money, at least until they fix their customer service issues. I have spend over 10 hours now waiting on hold over several phone calls to talk to their redemptions team. We cant solve the problem online as for whatever absurd reason, you cant insert a middle name as a Kris Flyer, so can't use my points online as my name doesn't match the name on the ticket, which does require all names...

I sent an email to their PR team and General enquiries team, neither seem to care to respond.

Really really regret spending our money here."
Singapore Airlines,They changed my flight time and put me…,2,They changed my flight time and put me on a partner airline. I have been waiting on the phone for 2.5 hours to speak to someone about this and then it hung up. 2.5 hours!!!!!!!! This is an absolute joke.
Singapore Airlines,Impossible to contact,1,"Impossible to contact, desperate to charge you more, worst airline ever!"
Singapore Airlines,Was very disappointed with the service…,3,Was very disappointed with the service especially after having good experiences in the past. Hope they can hear the feedback and work on the delays
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines -- nil customer service,2,"My wife and I have been regular passengers with Singapore airlines to Asia and Australia and are Kris flyer members.
13 months ago we booked a flight to Melbourne leaving 30th December 2021 with a transit in Singapore.
Singapore Airlines conditions at the time of booking explicitly allowed for a no-charge date alteration to the flights.
I amended the outgoing flight and was charged an extra £1000+ each for the amendment.
I have emailed the airline numerous times for a £2000 refund, and on each occasion have received a standard email acknowledging my email and no more. Some 4 months later I have still received no response to my request for a refund.

I conclude that Singapore Airlines have no intention of replying and honouring their terms and conditions.
Prospective customers would be ill advised to travel with this airline as they do not respond to customer complaints.
I will be issuing proceedings against Singapore Airlines and would encourage other prospective passengers to avoid Singapore Airlines, as their customer service is non-existent.

Terry and Janet Stowe"
Singapore Airlines,Horrific long waiting times on telephone contact,1,"I have been on the telephone for over 1 hour and 30 minutes, with no end in site. I wanted to change my flights - and the contact form said they will get back within 72 hours. Nothing as yet. What happened to the best airline and services? I had booked biz class, and now wish that i did not.. what a bad start to my trip!"
Singapore Airlines,Stay away.,1,"Absolute garbage customer service. After repeatedly being on hold for hours, I went in person to their office in ion orchard. Went 10 mins after their opening and was told there was a 4 hour wait time and that I could leave my phone number for a call back. I was then told my American phone number wasn’t eligible for a call back as they only do call backs for local numbers. Real efficient for what claims to be a world class airline. I have had better (and more polite!) customer service with domestic American airlines which are notorious for having terrible service with no frills. Flight is fine (if you’re ever able to get on the one you want) although food is nearly as bad as the customer service. If you want to pay exorbitant fees for horrible service, this is your pick!"
Singapore Airlines,Very poor.,2,"My brother often talked about Singapore Airlines being one of the best when he work in the business. That was twenty years ago to fair.
This was the first time I've flown with them and probably won't again. We had 4 flights, to and from Singapore and the Maldives. Our Singapore flights was in premium economy and to and from the Maldives economy. Premium economy was the poorest we've been on. Vietnam Airlines and EVA are far superior. SA is basically economy with bigger seats. Couldn't see any other reason for paying the extra money. Emirates economy was better the SA's premium. I'd pre ordered diabetic meals and they were shocking. Guess they serve the same to people who order bland meals because that's exactly what it was, bland. Was the same on all the flights. Every leg of their flights were also late to take off."
Singapore Airlines,What happened to Singapore customer service ?,1,What happened to Singapore customer service? I booked 3-4 weeks ago to fly to Brisbane (business class!). They took the money. I have NO proof of booking and NO contact from them. Sent two emails- NO answer. The googled UK contact phone 020 8961 6993 says 'out of use !'. Other UK phone lines say 'one hour or more waiting'. It recommends the 'Kris chatbot' which is useless except in shopping enquiries ! Are they still now operating with Covid staff? Used to be one of the highest rated airlines in the world.
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines changed my flight…,1,"Singapore Airlines changed my flight dates, which meant my connecting flights on both legs of my travel depart before the original flights.
I’ve spent two days trying to contact them via different offices, and each time I spent over 2 hrs on hold with no answer.
I sent an online message and the reply stated “ We are currently encountering high volume and will do our best to respond to you within 15 business days.“ this is a ridiculous amount of time, 15 business days, not even 15 calendar days. This means my flight would have departed before they contact me.
I booked for the first time with Singapore airlines since I am a gold member of Star Alliance network.

I booked several tickets with them and now regretting the decision. I would advise people to explore other options and airlines because they are not the best airline in the world anymore. Customer service is very very poor.

If we can’t contact them, even though you cannot change the flights online via manage my booking, and they refer you to contact them, then how do you fix the problem which they created.
Hope they read these messages and contact all those customers they have let down."
Singapore Airlines,Horrible Singapore airline Luggage service,1,"I flew business class on the SQ23 from NYC to Singapore on Jan 4th.
The flight was OK. Singapore air are cheap on wifi offering in business class. They need to learn from KLM/Delta/AirFrance classic hospitality. As for food options, not impressed. They don't offer salads and healthy snacks. They are too fixated on offering large variety of alcohol liquors. Again, they need to benchmark SKY TEAM for first class hospitality !!!
The nightmare started when I landed in Singapore.
Upon arrival, my luggage did not arrive with me. Upon checking with customer service at the airport, they indicated my luggage was not loaded on the plane in NYC. They said, my luggage was forwarded to LA for next day delivery to Singapore - RED FLAG1. WHY would sing air send it to LA when another flight from NYC will be departing the following day ??.
For next 8 days, I daily called the airline to find out the status. Please note, I was calling. No one from sing air called me!. I kept getting the same scripted answer. We are searching for your luggage. Finally, on day #9 my luggage arrived. My suite case was filthy and destroyed. It is like someone dragged along the runway for a long time. The fabric was ripped in 5 spots. Arm handle was broken.
When I opened it, beside spoiled goods, I discovered several stolen xmas gift items.
I submitted a claim on Jan 14th for spoiled and stolen goods. Till now, March 5th, I am still chasing Singapore airline for compensation with no light at the end of the tunnel.
To add insult to injury. Singapore airline, reached out to me regarding the damaged suite case. They said, my 27 inch Samsonite is a fake one - RED FLAG2. Please note, I bought it from Macy's in the USA 20 months ago and only used it 3 times. I replied to Singapore airline and indicated there must be miss understanding. This is genuine. But, they insisted it is a fake Samsonite. I finally gave up and asked them to replace it with identical Fake one - they can buy it from Macy's online. They said NO. They will either give me 180 SGD or American Tourister brand as a replacement.

Key takeaway from all of this. Singapore Airline is a fake façade of customer focus and service. Next time I will go back to fly SKY Team (KLM/ Delta / Air France). They are first class airline with genuine customer service focus. BTW, I have never ever had this type of experience with them."
Singapore Airlines,Poor customer service,1,"SIA informed that our flight time had changed and advised to contact them by phone. Have been attempting exactly this for several days, each time for hours on the phone. NO chance.
Online changes not possible, every time receive obscure error message. I also submitted an online ""request form"" but no reply.
Singapore Airlines is no longer worth the premium they charge."
Singapore Airlines,VERY VERY VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE IN…,1,"VERY VERY VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE IN NETHERLANDS!!

As early as February 2022, I already booked our flight to Cebu for July 16, 2022. Just today March 4, 2022, I got an email from Singapore that they cancelled our connecting flight from Singapore to Cebu.

I called the customer service in Netherlands and had to wait more than an hour before someone talked to. I explained my situation and was offered a flight where:
- lay over in Singapore is now 5 hours and 25 minutes as opposed to my original booking which was 3 hours and 45 minutes.
- aside from that, we have to fly first from Singapore to Davao then to Cebu as opposed to our original booking was was just Singapore to Cebu.

I asked the customer service if they can give me a compensation since I paid a lot for our flight AMS to CEBU because it was the shortest duration (18 hours and 25 minutes). Two of the customer support just answered, they couldn't helped me more than what they offered already. I am super disgusted by them. If I have known that I will only get a longer flight, then I would have chosen for it in the first place and pay much lesser. Now I paid a lot for a flight that became even way longer than initially planned.

I am never booking a flight with Singapore airlines anymore!!! Very unfair rebooking rules! Incompetent customer support in Netherlands!!"
Singapore Airlines,I have just asked Singapore Airlines to…,1,"I have just asked Singapore Airlines to help. They told me to call this number. 123 1235
You try it
It’s the talking clock
Do you think they want to be an airline??"
Singapore Airlines,Nearly 5 months and no refund of a flight they cancelled,1,"In October 2021 I requested a refund for my flights, which were cancelled due to COVID in 2020, and to date I have had no response to my request apart from the ‘auto response’ when I made it. More than 4 months waiting.
I completed one of their request for assistance forms in December 2021 asking about the progress of the refund, the ‘auto response’ said it would take 5 business days but to date they have not responded.
Another one of these forms was sent in January, the ‘auto response’ said it would take up to 15 business days to respond, now 25 business days later I still haven’t heard from them.
I have just completed another request for information, if they ignore this as well I’m afraid a Section 75 claim to my Credit Card company will be the only option.
I tried ringing them and the automated message was I would be waiting for over an hour, not an option.
I was always a fan of Singapore Air and the great service they provided and recommended them to others, never again!"
Singapore Airlines,bad customer support,1,20 min waiting time on the phone while having huge costs calling because there is no alternative support option. you your airline is terrible.
Singapore Airlines,Singapore Airlines WAS Good,1,"Singapore Airlines was very good, but has become complacent. The attitude of their check-in staff has worsened and their customer support is now virtually non-existent. They have become lazy and seem to believe that their virtual assistant, ""KrisFlyer,"" is an adequate replacement for real people. Dear Singapore Airlines, IT IS NOT. It is almost impossible to get any detailed information from that system and it is also almost impossible to get hold of an actual person. I have called at all times of their working day and every single time, was told that it would take over an hour. None of this is the sign of a great airline.

Singapore Airlines WAS Good, but not any more."
Singapore Airlines,Best Airline in the world,5,"What an amazing experience. SA has been spot on or close to it every time I've flown them. Great planes, excellent service, pretty good food (for an airplane). I wish more airlines in the US would follow their lead"
Singapore Airlines,"Still good, but not as good as they were",4,"They're not quite as good as they used to be now that the meal portions are quite small, but I think the airline was just affected badly by Covid and maybe the portion sizes will go back to normal once all of this is over with."
Singapore Airlines,Can be better,2,nil
Singapore Airlines,Customer service needs an attitude adjustment.,2,"For the most part, Singapore Airlines are pretty good to travel with.

However, they are not very good at being challenged. On my most recent trip from India and before the first leg of the flight from India began, we were checking in as a family. The young man that was looking after us advised me that there was another family that had requested to be seated together in the row where my chosen seat was. I refused this and it was left at that.

Imagine my surprise when I got to the boarding gate in Singapore Changi airport, my seat has been reassigned without notification as I have turned notifications on to receive any updates regarding the reservation. I still had the boarding pass that was issued to me (the one with the original seat that I picked) at the start of the journey.

I had to be seated elsewhere throughout the entire 7 hour flight and not enjoy it.

When we got home, I filed a complaint a few days later and the response was anything but respectful. I was told that one of the passengers in my group requested us to be seated together, which is completely false. I can clearly remember what the young man said about this. He said there was another family that requested to be seated together. I'm going to say that they did not handle the whole complaint very well and were condescending when I called them out on this.

See the confusion and the lying? In the end, I did not receive any compensation for what I have been through and not even a sincere apology from management.

Overall though, the airline itself offers a good flying experience."
Singapore Airlines,We booked flights to Thailand for 4th…,1,"We booked flights to Thailand for 4th February 2022 for our 5th Year wedding anniversary. We checked all the Covid and travel requirements

Turned up to Heathrow Airport 3hours before departure time with all the required documents - only to find out on the 1st of February the Thailand Government reintroduced their Thai Pass scheme (which was previously suspended) the Thai pass needs at least 5 days to process and they advise 7 days before you can follow it up. Therefore if we applied for the Thai pass we would not have it in time.

We explained our situation at the check in desk and even showed our attendant the UK government website which states the Thai pass is not required. Our Singapore check in attendant went and showed his manager. I also explained to the manager that we have all the required documents other than the Thai pass as it was impossible to attain the Thai pass in the timeframe we had.

The manager then just shrugged his shoulder and said tough luck I’m not going to let you board the flight without it. At which point I said “I understand and I really need a help to find a solution because I’m not sure what I can do.” He replied to me saying “it’s not my problem - you have to leave”.

The manager was completely rude and showed no empathy towards our situation. We pleaded at the ticket desk for some help but none was available. The staff at Thai Airways showed more empathy and care to answer our questions and explain the process. We literally had to turn back with all of our baggage and get a cab home.

I will never book another flight with Singapore Airlines again and will definitely be sharing more segments of my ordeal online.

They clearly do not care about their customers and have horrible Customer service"
Singapore Airlines,Shocking!,1,"We bought return tickets 7 months in advance with free flight change. We chose 1 stopover of 2hrs aswe have 2 kids 6 yrs old.
1 month after we booked we received an email saying one flight on each way has been cancelled.
The new flights assigned turned the 1 stopover into 2 stopovers each way. One of the connection allows only 15min between flights! Have they ever taken a connecting flight?!
I called multiple numbers, emailed to multiple email addresses with no t a single reply.
Simply shocking and extremely rude."
Singapore Airlines,One star is too good for this airline. AVOID,1,One star is too good for this airline. There should be a zero or minus option. Airline cancelled our flights to Perth WA and now say we must wait 6 to 8 weeks for our refund plus ‘downtime’ whatever that is. Meanwhile they keep our money 2500 euro and we cannot book with another airline. Very poor customer service. Not good enough to constantly refer you back to travel agent when they’ve created the problem and continue to withhold refunds. I will never ever travel with them again or recommend them to others. Beware & avoid! 😡
Singapore Airlines,Poor Customer Service,1,"Booked a flight from the UK to Western Australia at short notice for my mothers funeral. After WA changed their border policy I received an email that the last leg (with Scoot) had been cancelled, but as the whole booking was with SA I needed to manage the change through them. Flight is due to take off in 2 days, the SIN-PER leg is showing a blank status, all other legs are confirmed. I've filled in the online form requesting a refund, but have another 10 working days before a response is expected. I have no idea if I should cancel the booking online myself, at a cost, or be a no show for a flight that doesn't exist beyond SIN. Phone support menu won't get me to a human being, and the recorded message 'wait' time is announced at over an hour, whatever time of day or night I phone. This is rubbish customer service."
Singapore Airlines,No Answer from Singapore Air,1,"What a terrible experience. Not able to reach a customer service agent. Waited on the phone for over 3 1/2 hours. No answer. Finally disconnected after reading similar reviews and finding out that no one was likely to ever answer. What should have been a simple enough request which was to cancel one passenger from an existing booking which could not be done online, and has now resulted in waiting 6 weeks for a refund according to their website. Tried reaching out via an online contact form but a 15 day response time is unacceptable. We flew with this airline in 2019 and were pleased. But I will be looking for a new airline for future business travel. I can only imagine what failures people must be experiencing during each flight if the airline can’t even staff a call center."
Singapore Airlines,More unacceptable wait time problems,1,"More unacceptable wait time problems, 2 hours on hold then cut off. Sending an online message returns a 15 day response time. I just switched my flights from the dreadful British Airways but maybe I've gone from the frying pan into the fire. If airlines want to take £000s of your pounds surely they should provide a basic customer service. Hiding behind ""due to Covid"" has gone on a bit too long, Singapore Airlines must adapt and provide at least some level of customer support - currently it's nil."
Singapore Airlines,Used to be a good airlines,1,"I honestly believe Singapore airlines have gone down the tubes. I booked 2 first class flights only to be downgraded one a week before my flights and the other 4 days before.

When I tried to reach them they were unreachable with hours of wait times, unanswered emails and chats

Furthermore when you actually get an operator they are barely comprehendible and did not understand what I was trying to get at.

Really disappointed this used to be a good airlines."
Singapore Airlines,Gave my trust to Singapore Air only for them to break it,1,"Booked my London to Cebu ticket on the 2nd of January 2022 for the 29th of January. Received confirmation and all. 25th of January noticed that my Singapore to Cebu leg of the flight is not confirmed yet on the app while the rest of them are. On the 26th of January, tried contacting them via twitter which got me redirected to their email. Only then did I find out that my flight to Singapore to Cebu got cancelled. They had weeks to inform me about this, but only when I started asking was I told of such important information. Asked what options I have and am not able to receive any yet (do I even get to have one). Called customer service and waited for more than 3 hours, finally got through. As lovely as the man was on the phone who was trying his best to help me, the options were still rubbish. They want me to received a full refund of my ticket (£900 estimate) so that I can book my own tickets, 2 days before my said flight date. Am I the only one who thinks this is rubbish? Considering the flights are already doubled in price. They don’t even consider compensating me for that? Just that I can get a refund, or for the guy to “appeal” for a full refund. All this, less than 72 hours before my said flight.

Honestly, they could have warned me ahead of time and I could have more options. But, all they say is “thank you for your understanding”, I’m not even sure if they’re understanding me at all."
Singapore Airlines,Worst customer service and experience with Singapore Air,1,"Had the worst experience with Singapore Airlines today. I booked 3 business class tickets for my family worth $13,000 a couple weeks ago.

Today, my sister had told me that she needed to change her flight dates, so I went into the Singapore air app to manage the booking, to see if it’s possible to do an individual flight date change, to my horror, after agreeing to the covid requirements section, and pressing next, they didn’t even ask if I was confirming my change and decided to proceed with changing all 3 passenger’s flight dates.

I panicked and called the 24 hour customer service hotline. Someone picked up, this was literally 5 mins after the flight change happened.

I explained my situation and that it was an error and would like to change it back to the original flight date.

The guy checked with his “relevance” or “manager” and said I had to pay $663 to change the booking. I was extremely shocked as they firstly they were not flexible with the absolute error - which happened 10 mins ago as we were speaking - they clearly saw the change on their end and secondly did not hesitate to provide me with additional charges, to “fix the error”.

He even told me that there were NO seats left on that flight, despite the error being done literally 10 mins ago, that was the icing on the cake. After much pleading that $663 was a lot of money for an app error - which he also apologised that “the app had costed me money”, I wanted this ordeal to be over and proceed to provide my care details for payment. This did not end.

For the next 3 hours, he kept saying that the 3 cards I tried with were rejected, and that I need to call the bank to authorise Singapore air. It was not possible as all the cards had funds in it and I also used one of the cards to make a previous booking. It had nothing to do with the bank account.

Turns out it wasn’t any of our bank account’s error it was their system that wasn’t working. This in whole was just an absolutely terrible experience with Singapore Airlines - despite spending that huge sum of money, which my family had saved up for to experience the flight, first trip since covid.

Utterly disappointing and wouldn’t recommend Singapore airlines. I thought highly of them initially but this is just unacceptable and will not fly again with them."
Singapore Airlines,Canceling flights without notifying me. Refund 2.5 months overdue!,1,"They cancelled one connection flights without notifying me. Then I had to call and wait for 1 HOUR to be able to cancel the booking. The refund request was made on Nov 19th 2021 & it's been 2.5 MONTHS! No refund at all!
Every time you call you wait for 1 HOUR!

Took me a long time to get in touch with a call agent Andrew who was useless basically saying he could not do anything and I just had to call and wait at least 1 HOUR to ask about the past-due refund.

Do not book this airline!!!!"
Singapore Airlines,horrible customer service,1,"Horrible experience. I sent an email a month ago about my flight (because nobody was answering phone calls) and no response. Ridiculous. I have a flight in two days and I can't contact anybody about it, even though I have been trying for the past month."
Singapore Airlines,Very poor customer service. Book with other airlines.,1,"The Singapore Government provides COVID quarantine-free entry into Singapore called VTL (Vaccinated Travel Lane). My family is planning a quarantine-free trip to Singapore. I booked a VTL flight into Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Days later, the airline redesignated the flight as non-VTL without telling me. That means travellers on this flight no longer enjoy quarantine-free entry. I called the helpline. After waiting for more than an hour, my call was answered by someone called Mendoza. All I was asking for is to change my flight to another flight on the same day operated by its sister airline Scoot, which is a VTL flight. He told me that the flight I booked was never a VTL flight and rejected my request. I told him I have a booking confirmation from Singapore Airlines indicating that it was a VTL flight when I booked. He said he has proof otherwise, effectively accusing me of lying. I asked for a transcript of the call confirming what he told me. No, it is against company policy. How about just a simple email. Can't do that. Can I speak to a supervisor. No, there is no supervisor around. I then went to Singapore Airline web site /request.form to request a refund. Rejected again: ""We regret that we are unable to process your request as your booking is not covered under our travel waiver policy."" So I made a new booking with Scoot Airline directly while trying to sort out a refund with Singapore Airlines another way. Then, a day later, Singapore Airlines changed the flight back to a VTL flight! I now have 2 VTL bookings for the same trip. I called Scoot helpline. The staff was very helpful and friendly (what a contrast). Tried to help but it is out of her hand. So I called Singapore Airline again and spoke to someone called Ryan. He reject my request for a full refund. He said it is because of a change in my Government's policy that Singapore Airlines changed the flight from VTL to non-VTL and back to VTL. As far as Singapore Airlines is concerned, it is VTL now so you can fly. If you book another flight during the non-VTL period, that's your problem. Just to be clear, there was never been a change in Government policy that triggered the change. Once again, Singapore Airlines is being unhelpful. Once again, it is relying on invented facts to justify its high-handed approach to customer services. Book with another airline - one that treats you like a customer.

P.S. All the above happened *before* the Western Australian Government's border closure announcement on 20 Jan 2022."
Singapore Airlines,Customer service SHOCKING!!!!,1,"My partner and I have booked a flight for June 2022 for our honeymoon. We received an email to say our connecting flight has been cancelled and the next available one means we have a 16 hour lay over rather than 50 minutes. We choice this flight for the 50 minute lay over as we want to get to our honeymoon destination as soon as possible. Now we’re expected to spend the first part of our honeymoon stuck in an airport. I’ve just countless times to get hold of them, we’ve sent various requests via the website. They say 15 days for a response but it’s been well over that. I’ve tried calling just to be on hold for 2 hours and not speak to anyone. I’ve tried social media where I was told Covid is the reason for the delayed responses.. Covid has now been around long enough to employ more people to work within your customer service team and just feel this is another excuse. I just want to speak to someone but it’s impossible! I booked this flight as I thought Singapore airlines was a reputable airline but couldn’t be more wrong. Avoid!!"
Singapore Airlines,Diabolical service for what you pay,1,"Diabolical service for what you pay, Rude Racists and inconsiderate"
Singapore Airlines,Two superb flights as expected,5,"We traveled to Singapore not having seen our Son and family for two years because of covid.
We were lucky enough to travel both ways Business class as our Son had lots of points. The service was superb as was the food. They are our favourite Airline as whatever class you travel in , economy,premium economy , Business the standard of the cabin staff is consistently excellent.They are well trained ,friendly and professional I would recommend them to anybody."
Singapore Airlines,Flight Canceled. No phone call. No email. No Human. Nothing!…,1,"A leg of my travel was canceled by Singapore with no explanation. Notified by email, their standard email informed me that a portion of my travel was canceled and that someone will get back to me via phone call. Its been two weeks. No phone call. No email. Nothing! So I tried contacting them all hours of the day and night. No answer! It's like everyone is gone. Multiple calls to 1-833-727-0118 (and a few others) and left on hold for over two hours by their very annoying automated system and horrible repetitive music. No one answered. Tried multiple call-in options. No answer. No human. What the heck is going on? With so many options available to work from home now days, you would think that Singapore Airlines would have some employees work from home to provide customer support to customers. The online systems won't let me access my flight itinerary to see my other available flights. This is so frustrating. This has caused me undo stress. Make me sick to my stomach that they would treat customers this way."
Singapore Airlines,Cannot speak to a human being,1,"I have been on the phone trying to speak to a human being from the customer service. Tried the UK hotline which is “24/7” service, as well as their Singapore number. 2.5-hour wait and no answer, that was about 1pm. Tried again in the afternoon with the Singapore number, waited for another 1.5hrs but no answer. This experience has been very exhausting and dissappointing. I understand the pandemic is affecting everything, but it feels like they have closed their offices!"
Southwest Airlines,Southwest needs to allow families to book using points together!,1,"It is ridiculous that Southwest allows a family of four to earn points together when they fly, but then they can’t book together when using the points and requires each family member including kids to book their own flight separately. Seems like Southwest really needs to improve their policies and let a family with kids combine their points to book together on one account! Seems silly to make four family members all login separately to try to get flights. The points are becoming worthless. Then, the kids each have separate flights not connected to the parents app and it becomes a problem. Hopefully Southwest sees this and fixes the issue to become more family, friendly!"
Southwest Airlines,This staff member was outstanding,5,"Last Friday, a friend and I sought to change our return flight to Baltimore the following Monday, due to an anticipated snow storm. We were still in Baltimore when we tried to make the change, so we asked a staff member for help. That staff member turned out to be a woman named Imani (#131603) and she was absolutely fantastic: understanding, efficient, kind, and effective. The outcome was also perfect: We made it back without a hassle, safe and dry, and we didn't experience any of the weather delays that the storm caused the next day. We are so grateful to Imani. She was great!"
Southwest Airlines,My granddaughter is autistic and my…,1,"My granddaughter is autistic and my daughter had a trip to Disney planned. She wants to cancel her trip because my granddaughter's behavior flipped to agressive. To save the the plane from being turned around or save the embarrassment of being kicked off the plane, she wants to cancel the trip. Southwest will not refund her the money.

She has saved for awhile for this trip.

I think this is terrible. Southwest is a bunch of greedy a** holes."
Southwest Airlines,worst airline I have ever in my life,1,"It is the worst airline I have ever experienced. The flight attendants are bad and rule the plane. We were not seated when we booked tickets for three together. they paid no attention to customer service. I have traveled across the world and this airline has just appointed me so badly. I would never again book Southwest Airlines even at the lowest price.
This airline is worth a penny."
Southwest Airlines,poor customer service,1,"I arrived in St. Louis from San Francisco ON 12/16/24. Upon arrival notified that final flight going to DFW was delayed. Then informed again flight was delayed as plane needed a part to continue. Young lady at ticket counter could barely speak as she had a face mask on and did not know how to use microphone. After an hour and asking questions, informed gate was switched from E16 to E36. Another ticket agent at this counter was very rude and disrespectful to elderly people in wheelchairs asking questions. What is the purpose of customer service if a ticket agent hates doing their job and takes their negative energy to others? Has this company forgotten what brought them customers? This was flight 1268 from St. Louis to Dallas. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FLYING SOUTHWEST OUT OF SAINT LOUIS!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS."
Southwest Airlines,Flight #3834 on Sunday (Dec 15th)),1,Flight #3834 on Sunday (Dec 15th). The flight is over 1 hour and a half delayed and we are all boarded the flight and frustrated that we are still not moving. Flight attendants are laughing and having fun and showing zero empathy for the passengers who have been delayed over 1 hour and half. We are all just sitting in our seats waiting to depart and the flight attendants are joking around and laughing while we are all waiting to depart. Poor example of not reading the crowd by the Flight Attendants. Show some empathy.
Southwest Airlines,Southwest Airlines flight on 11/21 at…,1,"Southwest Airlines flight on 11/21 at 5:45 AM from Tulsa to St. Louis.
Pilots were late for first flight of the day, delaying departure.
Crew announced there would be no beverage service due to turbulence.
One of the smoothest flights one could have taken.
Very unexpected and dissappointing from an airline that had been known for wowing customers with great service,"
Southwest Airlines,I would've not even rated the service a…,1,"I would've not even rated the service a 1 star. We are disappointed as a company to learn that we are not able to transfer flight credit for other employers when traveling due to travel change. We will not receive a refund, and the flight credit is useless. We have spent so much money using Southwest Airlines and now our company will never use this travel airline ever.

Company out there that uses Southwest for travel I warn you now not to book. If you have any last-minute emergency or changes to your employee travel, you're wasting money!!"
Southwest Airlines,Thanks to Onnie on Southwest Flight #2913,5,"I want to give a big thank you to Onnie, the flight attendant on Southwest Flight #2913 from Chicago Midway to Cincinnati on October 28, 2024. His patience and kindness, especially with a mother and her young child, truly stood out. He went out of his way to make their flight smoother and more comfortable. The Non-GMO snacks were a nice touch too! It was a wonderful experience, and we’ll definitely be flying Southwest again."
Southwest Airlines,I love your direct comment to Boeing…,1,"I love your direct comment to Boeing this week; The CEOs of Southwest Airlines and American Airlines both want Boeing to deliver planes on time.

Too bad our flight from Costa Rica wasn't on time and we had to stay overnight in Houston with a little over $500.00 in expenses that was denied by your company since it wasn't your fault!! Nothing compared to the $6.1 billion dollars Boeing is losing but to hard-working people it goes a long way. American Airlines, Delta, JSX....any one except Southwest will get our money for flights next time."
Southwest Airlines,When attempting to update my trip…,1,"When attempting to update my trip (Wanna Get Away Plus) from Sunday flight to a Saturday flight, I was able to select 2 seats for $523 using the app. However, the app does not allow you to update a reservation when you have a lap child (a very ridiculous restriction).

I immediately called southwest, and they informed me the tickets were now $840. I expressed how I could see the tickets on the app (even after refreshing) and after 20 mins, was able to get the agent to split my reservation so my wife's ticket was $523 and my ticket was $840. They were unable to honor the price I should have received if the app had just worked. Further, the agent was not able to come up with this solution - I had to suggest it in order to reduce my additional cost from $700 and something to $380.

Overall, I am very disappointed in southwest and hope they can resolve this issue."
Southwest Airlines,"During the Holidays of 2022 , No Flexibility",1,"During the Holidays of 2022, I relocated across country, booked a trip home during xmas shutdown at work, (NOT FLEXABLE) flights were canceled for 5 day, by return could not be changed, therfore I had 1.5 days home with family. Received 800 dollars in fight vouchers, but (still unpacking, not flying) they all expired, I asked for extension, denied. DONE Flying Southwest Airlines For Life."
Southwest Airlines,Avoid this airline,1,They want to gouge customers when changing flight times. Its just insane how they treat you and want to squeeze every last dime out of you. Another airline on its way out.
Southwest Airlines,"Customer Service, whats that?",2,"I recently experienced what I consider to be terrible customer service from every level of customer service from checkin to boarding of the aircraft. I was flying from Las Vegas to Boise and it was a Saturday early evening. I tried to checkin at the counter downstairs where the lady waved me over and then said, Go check in at the self checkin. I had questions, but she wouldn't help, she said, you dont have bags so go checkin at self checkout. I was taken back by her rudeness, and there was nobody ahead of me or behind me. Then, I get upstairs and am trying to get through to my gate, and the information on my boarding pass didnt match my gate information. The individuals at gates C11 C12 & C14 would not help, to busy talking amongst themselves to help. Once again, terrible customer service. Then prior to boarding, the Southwest Airline attendant allowed families with dogs to go first, not disabled, veterans or people needing extra time. This is crazy! I had pre boarding but, I could barely get to the counter because his lack of controlling people around his desk area. When trying to scan my boarding pass, it was not working, so the attendant grabbed my phone and slammed it on the scanner. I am not impressed by the rudeness, the lack of customer service and disrespect to myself and my property. If you hate the job, find a new one, because the service and unhelpful attitudes does nothing for your sinking airline!"
Southwest Airlines,I personally only fly Southwest,5,"I personally only fly Southwest. I absolutely love them! As someone who is disabled they have made travel so much easier for me and their staff is so friendly and amazing. I've never had an issue with Southwest and based on my experiences if I do, I'm sure they'll help figure out a solution. My only suggestion is that BWI is fully redone inside. It could use a people mover system for sure, but that's largely out of their control. Their operations though out of Rochester, NY are superb as are their operations out of Orlando and BWI."
Southwest Airlines,I’ve been a southwest customer for over…,1,"I’ve been a southwest customer for over 40 years. In the early days, I loved traveling with them. They had low fares and interesting facing seats. As they grew so did their bureaucracy. When Herb retired, I knew the airline would go down hill… as it has. They are no different from American or Delta now. Old crotchety flight attendants"
Southwest Airlines,I have almost always had great…,4,"I have almost always had great experience with Southwest Airlines. Great rewards program. Good flight experiences (except for weather delays that affect all airlines). Lack of extra fees for flight changes and baggage. Friendly staff.
A couple of caveats: They never seem to have direct flights to anywhere I want to go. The Internet is often down. Business select doesn't offer much if you don't want a free drink. Early boarding (low A's) doesn't mean as much if there are so many preboarders."
Southwest Airlines,Never again will I fly SW,1,"We were delayed four hours (and it may be more) due to a bird strike and I had to scramble to make arrangements for my son, which was almost not possible and extremely stressful. There have been five gate changes for other flights near our gates, so there is clearly a huge amount of disorganization. The bathroom was disgusting and had feces on the rim of the toilet.
I understand that things happen, like bird strikes. However, there should be a plan in place for these events to mitigate delays for these occurrences. I will most likely not ever fly southwest again. There are massive issues that need to be addressed and it is very unfortunate that your lack of planning and extreme disorganization has caused significant and unnecessary stress for my family."
Southwest Airlines,We were traveling from Pittsburgh to…,5,"We were traveling from Pittsburgh to Baltimore, then connecting to Raleigh Durham. Flight 1714, July 11, 2024, Boarding at 12:50 PM. My husband and I are seniors I'm 79, he's 83. I have COPD. The Customer Service Agent (Phyllis) saw my distress when I arrived at her desk, got me a wheelchair and got one for my husband too! She was a sweetie, very attentive to our needs and a Hugh compliment to your Airline. In my younger days I worked in hospitality and in fact, taught customer service in several hotels from Pittsburgh to Washington DC. Please reward this sweet lady, she's an asset to your Airline."
Southwest Airlines,TRASH SERVICE - DO NOT FLY.,1,Sitting in Tampa for 6 hours trying to get home. Flight got delayed 3 times before cancelling it at 9:30pm. Southwest denied any compensation or hotel rooms. Worst experience I could’ve asked for this trip.
Southwest Airlines,The future of air travel,1,"They apparently are counting small fanny packs now. I suppose it makes sense since I heard they plan to start counting neck pillows. Soon they will probably start limiting people to one bag total. Flight staff are inconsistent. Some of them are helpful, others will nitpick you."
Southwest Airlines,I've flown 3 times this year and it's been great!,5,"I've flown 3 times this year on Southwest and at each interval I have had a great experience, even when things went wrong. During my most recent flight my app wasn't letting me display the boarding pass, but the counter agent remedied that immediately with a printed ticket.
I called in on a few occasions to have an agent book my flight and I didn't wait a long time. They were helpful and informative. The flights were from Long Beach Airport and Sacramento and at each location it was easy to board/deplane. The prices are well within reason and the process to book is very simple."
Southwest Airlines,Southwest Early Bird check in not guaranteed A pisition,2,Southwest rep just told me that purchasing earlybird doesn't automatically guarantee an A position and if you change your flight ypu give up earlybird yet I never saw a reimbursement since airfare was paid for in April. I signed up for earlybird and SOUTHWEST changed my flight. My boarding pass showed no earlybird yet my original ticket shows earlybird. No refund for either flight
Southwest Airlines,I was coming home from Reagan…,1,"I was coming home from Reagan International airport to St Louis on flight 4670, the landing was the most horrible experience I have ever had with ANY airlines. I really thought we weren’t going to make it, the worst flight ever!!!
I have been traveling with Southwest for years…. I should probably change."
Southwest Airlines,Mechanical issues causing delays - on 2 flights out of 2.,1,2 flights with SW on Sept 18th and Sept 22nd respectively. Both flights were delyed by more than 2 hours due to mechanical problems. The last delay made us miss our flight to Copenhagen. No support or assistance from SW.
Southwest Airlines,Can’t remember the last on-time flight,1,"Every time, without fail, this airline is at LEAST 30 minutes late. I avoid this crappy airline if I can but unfortunately sometimes I have to take a one way because the return time I want isn’t available on better, less crappy airlines. I’d almost rather not travel at all than sit on this cattle car and bake because the AC sucks while you are sitting, waiting. Pay for business class but why? Still packed airplanes with zero leg room and no arm room. So frustrating."
Southwest Airlines,THE WORSE RAPID REWARDS PROGRAM FOR…,1,"THE WORSE RAPID REWARDS PROGRAM FOR HOTELS! they are deceitful. They are liars. They told me I would get a refund for a hotel if the hotel would accept the refund. Hotel accepted. Got them both on the same line. They completely lied. Daniela is the supervisor- truly worse customer service rep I have ever encountered. She is not a problem solver, has no customer service etiquette. I have a SW airlines credit card I will be canceling. I will no longer be flying or using miles on SW airlines. the WORST"
Southwest Airlines,avoid southwest because of fake vouchers,1,"I got a vouchers for lost baggage and tried to apply it to a new ticket. Southwest online system confirmed the validity of the voucher, but failed to apply it to new ticket. Many calls to customer service, still cannot use that voucher. Avoid Southwest by all means"
Southwest Airlines,Worst airline never upgrade a rip off,1,"Worst airline. I made the mistake of paying double for their “ business class.” What a huge mistake. I thought I was treating myself but unfortunately about 30% pre boarded and took all of the premium rows. So even being A3, I was far back, crappy uncomfortable seats.

Pro tip, fake a handicap and you can get the perimeter seats for no extra charge."
Southwest Airlines,It’s not just one time,1,It’s not just one time! It’s multiple times and occasions I’ve been stuck dealing with bad service from southwest: I’m currently on a flight now that hasn’t taken off because some unknown occurrence. This stuff is terrible and it’s time for change! I mean for myself! I’m on my way to never flying southwest again. Never should my American dollars be used to help fund another person agenda at the cost of my happiness. 🖕🏽🖕🏽 southwest
Southwest Airlines,Southwest is the best.,5,"Southwest has always been my go to airlines. Being wheelchair bound disabled, no airlines has done such a outstanding job as Southwest. They've always treated me with upmost respect, helping me from my chair into my seat and folding my power wheelchair down so it can be loaded into the belly of the plane. Of all my locations, the staff that handles luggage, has taken great care of my wheelchair as it weighs 65 lbs. I can't express my gratitude enough for all they do."
Southwest Airlines,Internet is pretty slow for $8/24h…,2,"Internet is pretty slow and considering the price of $8; I'd seriously expect better than 3.64 Mbps down and 0.05 Mbps up for $8. Slow for software development (google searches, downloads/installs), browsing twitter, opening a persistent connection. Maybe satellite wifi would help... idk but I'm trying to get done work while on flights."
Southwest Airlines,Honestly all the flights I have been on…,1,Honestly all the flights I have been on this year (5+) have been delayed and I am pretty tired of them not knowing why/doing anything to fix it. Sure you get baggage check for free but at 2hrs delay not worth it. The quality has plummeted. I cannot wait for the new law to come into affect because Southwest will owe their customers millions. About time they had someone keep them accountable.
Southwest Airlines,Customer service and Airline employees…,5,Customer service and Airline employees were the best! Very organized boarding procedures. And they don't nickel and dime you to death like some we can mention. Stress and hassle-free flying.
Southwest Airlines,Great effort in crisis period,4,"Despite the fact that Southwest cancelled three attempted flights to see my daughter and granddaughter for Christmas, the staff at SAT airport went above and beyond to try to help me get to Indy. Of particular note was Briana at the ticket counter. She was getting off shift at 12:30 am, but stayed with me getting another flight that was also ultimately cancelled. Still the SWA staff were great!"
Southwest Airlines,Horrible Experience!,1,"We have been flying Southwest Air for many years. Well, yesterday on Flight 1571 from LAX to BWI, we experienced the worse flight of our life. There was an older Flight Attendant that was not allowing people to get to the bathroom, she tossed snacks at you, and yelled loudly at an elderly gentleman. The Lead Flight Attendant told us that WiFi would not be available on our flight. For almost five (5) hours, we listened at crying, loud babies and kids. My Husband called today to complain about the problems and was pretty much blown off by another older sounding woman at their Corporate Office. Their flights are now full, the bottom of the seat is thin and if you are sitting in front of a child, you could be kicked in your back the entire flight—my experience. No longer recommended!"
Southwest Airlines,Flight Etiquette No Longer Exist,1,Why do I pay to upgrade my seating position so I can enter and exit the flight sooner only to have people from the back shove their way to the front when it’s time to disembark. I’ve flown on a Mexican Airline Volaris where the Captain announces that there is an order to exiting a plane and it’s done by rows!!! He makes everyone remain seated until their turn. People have zero consideration anymore and are treating planes like greyhound buses. There is no flight etiquette. Passengers need to be told!!! Southwest just allows rude passengers to charge from the back to front. It’s so annoying!
Southwest Airlines,Dispute of standby fee and lack of notification writing this review to talk about…,1,"I am writing this review to talk about a concern about booking a flight in advance and being charged a standby fee. On Aug 16, I booked a flight with Southwest Airlines under reservation #4tcehq. My booking included a return flight, but I encountered an issue that led to an unexpected fee due to my return flight being placed on standby. On my day of departure, I confirmed my flight from MCO, only to discover that my flight was on standby and subject to an additional fee. I was not informed of the standby status or the associated fee before this confirmation, which created an inconvenience and an unexpected expense to me. i spoke with a supervisor named Dennis who was very rude and hung up the phone on me. I will never fly this airline again."
Southwest Airlines,Experience on flight was terrible,1,It’s hit and miss on flight experience. Some attendants are rude. DO NOT purchase their internet. It is the worst. All other airlines are better. They are always in the crappiest parts of airports. I reached out to customer service on the plane and told to contact customer service. It was their online customer service. I was on the plane and I told them. I basically got “too bad.” Thank god my company is moving towards Delta.
Southwest Airlines,Continuous Run-Around from Customer Service,1,"I have been chasing a refund due from the flight disruption since 12/30/22 and keep getting non-answers from the customer service line. I have tried by phone and by email. Their internal processes are extremely lacking and they don't seem to want to take care of their customers like they used ot.

Even though I have tons of points, credits and both myself and my husband are credit card holders for SW, they have lost my patronage after this lack of responsiveness. We'll be taking our business to United. I'd recommend you do the same."
Southwest Airlines,Audios Southwest!,1,"Audios Southwest!! And for good I am transfering my business, I'm sure along with thousands of others after your 2022 Christmas debacle to an airlines that will, unlike you, earn and deserve my frequent flyer business and not leave me stranded out of state having to rent a car to get home! You don't deserve my business nor will you ever see a penny from me again!! Ever!"
Southwest Airlines,I used to fly SW Airlines almost…,1,I used to fly SW Airlines almost exclusively and continuously promoted it. In the past year it has gone completely down the tubes. I fly to ABQ from DEN at least once every 3 weeks on business. Now I am on United first class. I can afford it and it is well worth the not great fare difference. SW has been over 1 hour late on the return flight over 4 times in a row. The gate agents have now become terribly rude and inconsiderate. I have 80k points on my SW Rapid Rewards account and I am just going to give them away rather than endure the torture and inconvenience.
Southwest Airlines,We have used Southwest a number of times,5,"We have used Southwest a number of times and we have been very pleased with the service. We just got back from Panama city Florida and the service at check in all the way to boarding was seamless. The Southwest flight attendants are great! Can't go wrong with 1st bag free also. Personally, we like the choose your own seating once on board verses the assigned seating on other airlines."
Southwest Airlines,Great service.,5,"The day before our scheduled flight I checked in through the app. I called my wife to ask if she had checked in, but she was having difficulty w/the app. I called customer service. Within a few minutes the customer service rep had fixed the problem & even had her booked in a better group. SWA customer service doesn't always get the credit & positive recognition they deserve.

In addition, when we were checking in for our flight, there was a line for 75 plus people. The local SWA employee in St. Louis had a great attitude & was so positive in all her interactions with all those trying to check in. Again, I just want to give credit & recognition to the many who do a great job every day. Thank you."
Southwest Airlines,Life long traveler of Southwest,1,"Life long traveler of Southwest. Done with them after the Christmas debacle which left us stranded and unable to see family. 5 days later still don’t have our bags nor can you get anyone to answer the phone. Unless they compensate those who got screwed out of missing Christmas with their family, presents that are wrapped in suitcases that have vanished, I will never fly this airline again. Southwest, take a small fraction of the millions of dollars you make off of us every year and do the right thing. If you care."
Southwest Airlines,Canceled flight with no compensation 0r…,1,Canceled flight with no compensation 0r concern. Very rude could careless attitude 😒 don't fly this group or you will be regretting it. Bad employees who offer no help at all. They should all be fired.
Southwest Airlines,Travel Voucher Not Honored,1,"I need to cancel a flight due to Covid travel restrictions. I was given a travel voucher but unable to re-book withing one year, again due to Covid travel restrictions. Southwest refuses to honor my voucher. They just took my money and will not work with me in way except to say sorry we are keeping your money."
Southwest Airlines,Amazing Airline!,5,"This airline is amazing! It had complimentary drinks and water! The seats were comfy, and the leg room was spectacular. 10/10, would recommend!"
Southwest Airlines,I really hate this airline man,1,"I really hate this airline man. They can't even get their credits system right. They have these stupid voucher programs that you have to use before a certain date if you don't book a flight but they don't actually count s flight credits because flight credits somehow don't expire. It's extremely confusing and not worth the hassle for an airline that barely goes any where even domestically. I'm at the end of my rope with them, truly"
Southwest Airlines,Southwest should be ashamed and embarrassed,1,Absolutely negative. Long story short: Check in lady put the wrong names and city on our bags. Took 2 weeks to locate after multiple phone calls and not one employee was helpful or even cared. Had to purchase everything for work and whatever for 2 weeks. Supposedly found it and Fedexed it. Gave them the hotel address twice and we had to pick it up at a fedex location and miss work 2 days prior to leaving back home on southwest. I have no confidence anyone can do the simplest of tasks. How embarrassing.
Southwest Airlines,Southwest: once the best and now the worst,1,"This airline has gone from 5 star to 1 or 2 stars in the course of 2 years. On a trip from San Diego to Savannah and back using 2 flights each way, one flight each way was cancelled at the last minute. And this was well before the Christmas meltdown. SW offered to send us a day later - not acceptable and we found another airline at a higher cost due to a last minute fare. On the return they would not rebook us on an alternative route through another city knowing our connecting flight would likely be cancelled. We had to do it ourselves, rebook and cancel our old flights because personnel at the airport counter lied to us and said no alternatives were available. Used to fly them weekly and now will avoid them at all costs."
Southwest Airlines,It's OK to save seats.....right ?,1,"The flight attendants need to enforce the No saving of seats policy. I purchased early bird seating only to get on the plane and there were at least 20 rows where individuals were saving seats for passengers who were not on the plane yet. This encourages one person to get upgraded boarding, to put things on seats for several others. We had B9 and B10 and could only find two seats together in the second to last row. You do the math. c'mon flight attendants, get a backbone!"
Southwest Airlines,Good experience of Southwest Airline,5,"I know there are some poor reviews on American local carrier Southwest. But I flow from San Jose to Las Vegas and back on Southwest in the last two weeks, and they were brilliant.

The staff are caring and helpful, and they actually socially engage with their passengers. Plus they give you a free drink and snacks on the plane, for a one hour flight I thought that was fantastic. I'm not even going to say airlines that service UK like Ryanair can learn from them, because I don't think Ryanair wants to learn anything from anyone!.

So, southwest thanks for taking us to Vegas and back on your planes, we will definitely fly with you again in future."
Southwest Airlines,If I could give Southwest Airlines no…,1,"If I could give Southwest Airlines no stars I would. After a recent trip to Vail Colorado for my son’s wedding my flight home to Charleston was a nightmare. After boarding the plane a medical supervisor told us we had to deplane ,holding up the rest of the plane, as my husband told the check in person that he had some altitude sickness in Vail. He was fine in Denver and felt fine on the plane. After quite the embarrassment,they made us leave and said we could be checked out by their EMT. The EMT determined my husband was fine but they still wouldn’t let us back on the plane. After kicking us off the flight for no apparent reason, they didn’t even offer to help rebook and let us stay at the airport for a day and a half to get home to Charleston without any assistance. If they thought my husband was so sick so he couldn’t fly, which was not the case,they should’ve been more sympathetic and helpful. Poor everything!"
Southwest Airlines,Everything is bigger in Texas,1,Everything is bigger in Texas. Including the incompetents that now run Southwest Airlines. My wife was flying “business class” when she was left stranded at Dallas Love Field. They changed gates and left her behind. Then put her on standby for the next morning’s flight. No help whatsoever for finding her a hotel. What a joke.
Southwest Airlines,I just want to let people know that in…,1,"I just want to let people know that in light of the recent devastating fire on Maui, I was instructed by Hawaii’s Mayor via televised news to cancel plans to visit Maui. I called Southwest Airlines to cancel my RT flights to MAUI. They canceled my flight but would not refund my money. Instead they are holding my fare as a credit (without interest I might add). Southwest also told me that I must now forfeit my early check in fee to total $50. So, Southwest is hanging on to my ticket fare and keeping the early check in money that they encourage customers to purchase. I actually may consult a lawyer on this one. PS: Heart felt wishes to the locals of Maui."
Southwest Airlines,Just called Southwest Customer Service…,1,Just called Southwest Customer Service because I noticed I transposed two letters of my wife's name on the reservation and couldn't figure out why the app or website wouldn't let me correct it. It cost $75 for them to correct it which is ridiculous and took me 30 minutes. That is straight up criminal for an error I noticed on a reservation that doesn't take place for 2 months.
Southwest Airlines,Outstanding. Compassion under the circumstances.,5,"I can only comment on my situation as we've yet to fly with Southwest.

We had a flight booked and early into our US trip received a call from our home that my wife's mother was gravely Ill. We were on a plane 10 hours later going back home.

I cancelled Southwest domestic flight same day and later emailed them asking for a refund. I explained in detail the circumstances we were in.

They went the extra mile for us and refunded our flight even though they were under no obligation to do so.

That small amount was critical at that time as we incurred substantial costs due to cancellation fees and re-booking costs.

In light of what happened I can easily give them a 5 star rating."
Southwest Airlines,"Ahhhh, Southwest 💕",5,"Ahhhh! Sigh of relief.

Southwest Airlines. Always, and reliably, excellent.

Every time. Value, service, customer care.

Slowly but surely, they have won our loyalty. Now we only travel with them.

Heartfelt thanks Southwest 💕"
Southwest Airlines,Do yourself a favor and choose a different airline,1,"We made sure that we are on the correct gate according to the screens. Turns out that the screens were incorrect and the speakers didn’t work. A Southwest Airlines lady claimed that she told the group waiting here to switch gates. We were sitting there the whole time (for 1,5 h) and the information didn’t reach us. They weren’t also calling our names before closing the gate.

Getting a refund was also tricky because they claimed it was our fault. Luckily I took a picture of the incorrect screen during departure time.

I got vouchers and was forced to use southwest airlines once more. The vouchers didn’t cover the tax, so I had to pay 50$ none the less. I selected business class and oh boy it didn’t made a huge difference.. I had access to slow internet during he flight and I got a free drink voucher. I asked for a hot chocolate but it turns out that the drink had to be alcoholic (stupid, what if I’m pregnant?). So I ordered a beer and wanted to take it home. Before I was leaving a stewardess took the unopened can from me.. saying she has to, sooorry. The kid next to me was allowed to take the snacks home.

I will never fly with Southwest Airlines again. Worst experience ever.

PS: they also damaged my suitcase."
Southwest Airlines,southwest airlines,1,"i understand that the weather conditions are not the staff’s fault, but they were not helpful at all. super impatient. our flight got canceled after multiple delays. will not be flying southwest again. my family is still in the airport trying to get our baggage and figure things out."
Southwest Airlines,Shockingly Bad Experience,1,"Our flight was scheduled to leave Las Vegas at 2:55 PM. With no announcements in the gate area, the flight was quietly delayed to 3:15 PM, then 3:50 PM, then 4:15 PM, then 4:55 PM. Even as I write this review, there still has not been an official reason given for the delay. We have been told as passengers that we will “get to our destination, as soon as we can“. I find this insufficient. With corporate executives making millions of dollars just last year and flying around on their own private planes, they are not (and will never be) subjected to the shocking levels of inconvenience and stress caused by aircraft delays. Many that are stuck here with me are missing important family events, or connecting flights. The contempt shown for passengers who paid them good money (and who are responsible for their rise to a nationally recognized airline) is amazing. I have flown Southwest for 16 years, and this flight will be my absolute last. If there is anyway possible to avoid using Southwest airlines, I would encourage readers to do so."
Southwest Airlines,What happened to Southwest?,1,"I used to think very highly of Southwest. They always had great employees and the flights were on schedule. While they still have great employees, I have experienced several significant flight delays over the past six months. As recently as March 6, 2023 we had to deboard a plane for a maintenance issue. Today, March 8, 2023 oxygen masks have to be replenished causing delays. They are now as bad as American Airlines. This is my last flight with Southwest."
Southwest Airlines,Flew from Baltimore to Pittsburgh…,5,"Flew from Baltimore to Pittsburgh 10/31/23 on flight 1211 at 11:10 am. What a wonderful, kind crew. Excellent flight and the attendants were much fun and a delight to fly with. The Captain actually pushed me in my wheelchair to the door of the plane. What a great guy! Always liked southwest and they way they go above and beyond. Keep up the excellent service"
Southwest Airlines,If I could leave less then 1 star I…,1,If I could leave less then 1 star I would. My experience has been poor from start to finish twice I have been delayed. One delay was long they caused me to miss my connection flight. They didn't even bother assisting me with finding a new flight until I went to the customer service booth. The 2nd time they ask us to line up to board and then tell us to sit....the pilot called out. I will never book with this airline ever again. I have been treated as if I bought my ticket from a bargain basement sale
Southwest Airlines,I'm upset!!,1,"You stated you're going to do right by your customers. At first I thought it was a spam email. I decided to open the email it says we're offering you $250 for reimbursement. You cant be serious Between booking a flight with another airline (which every airline was price gauging). Between food , hotel & delta airlines flight I spent $2000. I can't believe this SMH."
Southwest Airlines,I'm currently on flight #407 and the…,1,"I'm currently on flight #407 and the plane is NASTY! How are you expected to place your valuable items on a Nasty floor? The flight attendants ( I would write their name but they didn't have on name tags) are very rude and when asked they looked like they were used to flying under these conditions. I'm an A-lister and have never flown on a dirty, nasty plane. Did y'all fire the clean-up crew, Because this is sad and ridiculous!!
@Southwest please explain!"
Southwest Airlines,The recent incident at Christmas…,1,"The recent incident at Christmas reminded me of a past experience I had with them. I was with my mom in LA and she was being treated for breast cancer. We had to fly back to home and our flight was canceled due to ""bad weather"". We were at the airport and there was hardly anything bad with the weather. Other flights were taking off without disruption. We called the customer service and they refused to do anything about the situation or comp us for an additional night at the hotel. After that I never flew with southwest again."
Southwest Airlines,Southwest is THE best customer focused airline,5,"In my former life, I worked as a consultant and traveled 2-3x per week, every week for about 9 years.
When you travel that much, you get to experience the way airlines manage their customers and customer relations.
In short, Southwest has been the single best, most reasonable, most helpful and most caring airline I have ever dealt with.
If I'm traveling, the first place I book is thorugh Southwest. Even if SW isn't the cheapest, I would rather pay a premium with SW, than travel anywhere else.
I recently missed a flight b/c i was in bed sick and couldn't contact SW to cancel before the flight. When I did call their customer service, they refunded my fair 100% with no penalties or charges. The next time I travel, I'm spending all of that money, plus some more, with Southwest."
Southwest Airlines,If I could give this airline 0 stars I…,1,"If I could give this airline 0 stars I would do it! It is the worst. Never travel with them! The plane is disgusting and your luggage will arrive completely damaged. We were not able to check the luggage until 4 hours and 10 minutes after our flight and now they say we were too late with informing them (you can only claim until 4 hours after your flight). Go for Hawaiian airlines if you travel there, cause they are way way better and few extra dollars for your ticket will pay off!!!!!"
Southwest Airlines,This is the sh*tbox airline,1,"This is the sh*tbox airline. Crappy old Planes, horrible flight attendants who hate their work & a scammer no assigned seat policy where if I buy business class on ALASKA I know I am getting seat 1A regardless of the cripples,old people & ret&rds. But no. These degenerates & their 20 cohorts first so by the time I Board Im in row 7 seat ? What the eff! Never again. This p*ss poor excuse for an airline needs to be shut down or just cater to the hoi poloi!"
Southwest Airlines,Super f@#$&cking delay,1,"Super f@#$&cking delay, was waiting for 10 passengers but after all 10 passengers arrived. 40 minutes later still on the f@#$&cking ground. First time using Southwest and I will never ever use Southwest again. Someone suggested to use Southwest, I shouldn't have listened to that person. Thank Southwest you f@#$&cked up my schedule."
Southwest Airlines,"Airline issues will always occur, but with Southwest it seems to occur the least",5,"I think many people only leave a review when they have something negative to say. I've flown on Southwest Airlines for 30 years without issues. I think they lost my bag once, but that happens with every airliner. The Southwest staff is SO MUCH friendlier than other airlines. Southwest's prices are often cheaper than others, too. I've had a few unfortunate situations with Southwest, but out of all other airliners, I've had the LEAST amount of issues with Southwest. Even when I call their main customer support line, the agents are understanding, courteous, and helpful. It's a reality that problems will occur in any business. I appreciate Southwest's importance on customer service. Definitely my favorite airline!"
Southwest Airlines,Absolutely Terrible Service,1,"Absolutely the worst service I’ve received from any airline. First, my flight on 12/22 was cancelled and rebooked to the 23rd, and again to the 28th. I had to spend over $500 on an emergency flight back home as I had plans for the holiday season. I tried calling Southwest for a refund, and after being on hold for over an hour, they refused to give it to me! Never booking another Southwest flight ever again."
Southwest Airlines,Prices are good but they allow people…,2,"Prices are good but they allow people with three or four bags to board which impacts the comfort of everyone on the plane. The seat cushioning is almost criminal so beware if you have a long flight. On the plus side, I can always find a flight time that agrees with my schedule."
Southwest Airlines,They are scammers,1,"They are scammers, who hide the real intentions of their airline behind hyperlinks and fine print while outwardly acting like they are the easiest airline to change flights around with. They will take your money and then tell you that you are at fault for not reading fine print that is linked at the bottom of the page that contradicts their publicity campaigns."
Southwest Airlines,Longtime Southwest flyer,3,"Longtime Southwest flyer. They are not the same airline as they were concerning rewarding their loyal customers. They keep increasing the number of points you need to make tier status, cut flights to major destinations and no longer give frequent flyers drink coupons."
Southwest Airlines,"The slogan ""bags fly free"" becomes…",1,"The slogan ""bags fly free"" becomes irrelevant when the passengers not their bags ever board the airplane. My sister was planning a visit, over the course of 5 days they cancelled 6 of her flights to the point she had to give up. Canceling one flight is frustrating but sometimes unavoidable, rebooking a customer on another flight only to cancel it as well is madding and shows a lack of planning, repeating this cycle 6 times revels the utter incompetence of this airline. They over sell, over book and have no plan B. They are clearly unequipped to handle any hiccups and rather than having a contingency plan in place for mishaps they completely melt down."
Southwest Airlines,I flew Southwest airlines To go to…,5,"I flew Southwest airlines To go to Disney world from Saint Louis Missouri. I am in a wheelchair. Everyone in southwest airlines was accommodating, kind and courteous. They went out of the way to make sure I was comfortable on the way to Orlando and back home."
Southwest Airlines,Southwest is my airline of choice,5,"Southwest is my airline of choice, and I fly around 30 times a year. Free checked luggage, friendly people, easy to change flights, and that amazing companion pass are the reasons I continue to fly Southwest. I build up points faster here than with any other airline. Love it!"
Southwest Airlines,We had an incident on the flight I was…,5,"We had an incident on the flight I was on with an unruly passenger. They handled it with professionalism care for the customers, and considering how awful it was they tried their best to make it better for us. The flight back was beautiful no incidents very good to us. I will only fly Southwest now you guys do a great job."
Southwest Airlines,I will never use Southwest Vacations…,1,"I will never use Southwest Vacations again unless it’s some sort of crazy “travel emergency.” They make it very difficult to change your flight. You can’t do it through SWA & there are change fees. Don’t be deceived. I think they must be a second party travel agency. The reps are in an outside the US call center & don’t always speak good English. I had to pay for another ticket because I could not just go on the app & change my flight. My trip cost an additional $260!! So, it’s definitely not worth the “savings.” It’s so much better & easier to book through Costco Travel where they actually care about their customers!!"
Southwest Airlines,Poor service,1,"Poor service. My original flight was to depart at 10:30 PM. I got to the airport a little after 8 PM. Flight 5488 to Atlanta has been delayed more than 5 times with completely unacceptable reasoning in my opinion. I am still sitting in Austin airport while Southwest send updates of delays. You’re updates aren’t helping me, I have back to back meetings starting at 8 AM and currently if this flight doesn’t get pushed back for the 6th time I will currently reach Atlanta at 6:14 AM, not my office where my meetings are held, ATL airport. This is ridiculous. I’ve spoke to many people with no help. This will be my last time flying with southwest, I never had this issue with American Airlines."
Southwest Airlines,The no assign seating practice is…,3,"The no assign seating practice is highly inappropriate. This is a country of selfish people who like their space. It makes no sense. Today takes the cake though. There were 2 empty seats back by the bathroom and they didn’t allow anyone to sit there on a very full plane. As someone traveling with their spouse and who uses the bathroom a lot; it sucks. You can screen share or be with them. If the plane crashes you’re all alone even if you didn’t travel alone. Why even assign seats in the ticket if it’s total bs. People aren’t kind to move and flight attended aren’t gonna play that game. Everything else about southwest is pretty dope; so to be fair I give 3 stars. Also, the snacks are peanut free but have multiple other of the top deadly allergies and they have the audacity to call it an allergy friendly snack. My allergies disagree as does the nutritional label (see ingredients list)."
Southwest Airlines,I like this airline,5,I like this airline. I’ve flown with them multiple times last year. I mistakenly flew with United last week. Their app isn’t work and they don’t include carryon in the ticket price. United airlines is such a scam and I missed the service and ease of southwest. Just wanted to say I appreciate an easy and smooth experience.
Southwest Airlines,This airline is BROKEN,1,This airline is BROKEN and I hope Elliot Management can turn it around. Please stop trying with the folksy inflight service attempts and just fix your planes and upgrade your maintenance problems #lasvegas #5022 #abq
Southwest Airlines,SWA has a number of good features,4,SWA has a number of good features like low prices - we do not pay for upgrade to sit closer to the front - and SWA does not charge for checked bags. Changes/transfers are easy and don't cost too much if you get the upgrade. I have the Rapid Rewards credit card that earns points with everything you purchased. My round-trip flight from KC to Philadelphia was purchased with points.
Southwest Airlines,Cancelled flight that hasn't happened yet with no refund,1,"Southwest airlines are awful and I never want to book with them again. I booked tickets 3 months ago, missed my flight and they cancelled my flight back with no refund. My flight hasn't even happened yet. I told them I want to book the flight out again and they want me to pay for my flight I've already bought and then maybe I could get a refund!!! The flight hasn't even happened yet!"
Southwest Airlines,Called customer service because I tried…,1,"Called customer service because I tried to upgrade to better seats, the feature didn’t work however it charged me twice without giving me better seats and when I got a rep on the line instead of helping she blamed me and told me to contact my bank for help! How’s that for service?"
Southwest Airlines,Nothing went wrong and I am a HUGE fan…,1,"Nothing went wrong and I am a HUGE fan of Southwest. For the past 15 years I have flown this airline and refuse to fly any other.

My complaint is in regard to the article about the woman and husband who were asked to leave the plane over a sweet little dog who WAS in a carrier. The woman consoled the dog buy giving the pup a pat to ease his anxiety and was called out by a flight attendant who was so full of themself it's a wonder he or she had room for breakfast in the morning!

I NEVER expected this from Southwest! Always a great and welcoming airline??? I have had a dog on this airline who was allowed to sit on my lap! Has Southwest begun to hire flight attendants who are looking for people whom they can make miserable?

I have some advice for Southwest and ALL airlines... HOW ABOUT THE BABIES AND UNRULY CHILDREN? They are much less behaved than any dog in a dog carrier!"
Southwest Airlines,My recent flight experience with…,5,"My recent flight experience with Southwest Airlines was very pleasant. From the check in to my final destination. I have a disability, so I can’t walk through the airport to get to the gate without wheelchair assistance. And the Southwest transportation assistant’s are very helpful, personable, knowledgeable and pleasant people. And will get you to your destination on time and will either stay with you or come back to ensure that you are boarded onto the plane safely. The flight personnel are very friendly and helpful as well to ensure your safety and comfort. I’ve never had a bad experience when I’ve travelled with this airline. As a matter of fact, I have a flight booked for next month."
Southwest Airlines,we flew for the first time and they…,1,"we flew for the first time and they ruined my luggage. the lady at the baggage dept told us to scan the bar code but never said you have 4 hrs. go to website big issues so had to have nice lady file for us told us they are good at taken care of this issue. send all the info pictures and receipt. Now told nope not paying cause you only had 4 hrs. so this is now they treat customers. Will never Fly them again. they do owe me for destroying my suitcase, it to top it off the lady who works for them said happens all the time and you shouldn't buy that kind cause it doesn't expand wasn't that nice of her.
jamie"
Southwest Airlines,Over the last 6 or 7 years I've hung…,1,"Over the last 6 or 7 years I've hung In there . Things can't get any worse. Right. Thought it was management shift or something? NOPE, I WAS WRONG. When I've observed parents and their sick babies (ear trouble, tummy air sickness) getting poor treatment from stewardesses, other passengers pitching in to help. That was the last straw. Are they afraid of getting barf on their uniform? I felt so bad for the children. Arrogance and greed."
Southwest Airlines,Flight for 12/29/22 cancelled on 12/27,1,I am losing thousands of dollars due to Southwest Airlines cancelling my flight this morning at 0300 on 12/27 for my flight on 12/29/2022 at 0612 to Dallas the. On to Sacramento. I don’t know that I will ever trust this airline again. I want them to reimburse me for all the money I’m losing not being able to work and no flights through the new year. Very poor service.
Southwest Airlines,early-bird check-in,2,Watch the early-bird check-in as it says guaranteed A1-A15 boarding we ended up with A60 and B1. Might as well have taken our chances and saved some money.
Southwest Airlines,The worst customer service I've ever…,1,"The worst customer service I've ever had, from checking in to not getting a drink in time before landing. The flight attendant came and forced me to throw away my unfinished drink that had a lid.
Don't fall for the ""free"" it's not worth the circus act. They allow 2 free bags checked in, but if you only have one bag and it's over their weight limit you are charged $75
Not worth your time and money. Fly with another company that is up to date on customer service.
Hire people that care if you want to keep your customers."
Southwest Airlines,Southwest needs an overhaul,1,"Southwest needs an overhaul! I will never fly this airline again out of Charlotte! No kiosk for checkin. You have to stand in line for minimum, sn hour. If you pay extra for early boarding, you'll find a**holes that boarded and are saving seats for people that didn't pay. This SHOULDN'T be allowed. I hate this airline now and will never fly with them again."
Southwest Airlines,superiority complex issues,1,"Lauren was my flight attendant for austin to Vegas. I rang the bell to ask for a snack earlier than before end of flight. Instead of a simple no. She said ""you didn't see the food before the plane?""

Of course I did I just needed to board the plane on time.

Said if I ring the bell one more time ""we're done""

Woah.

They train their people to have superiority complex issues"
Southwest Airlines,Fat policy is S[[[[T,1,"I was at the airline where I saw you boot out a mother and two children for one fatty to have 3 seats. 3 literal seats. How can someone even take up that much s[ace? You [your so sad that you cant have cussing or take criticism can you?] literally stranded a mother and two children because of one obese woman? You all suck, your policy is crap. Your glorifying obesity and you are all a pile of horse sh-"
Southwest Airlines,SOUTHWEST AIRLINE HATER,1,"1. FIRE THOSE IN CHARGE OF THIS AIRLINE
2. LIKE THOUSANDS, THIS AIRLINE (NOT THE WEATHER) RUINED MY CHRISTMAS

8. PLEASE PUBLIC AND WORLD - TAKE THIS AIRLINE DOWN ONCE AND FALL FOR DOING THIS TO ALL OF US - GO UNITED, DELTA, FRONTIER....ANY ONE IS BETTER THAN THIS SHOTTY CARRIER!!"
Southwest Airlines,Southwest is Back,5,"After last year's service debacle I was hesitant to fly Southwest again, but I'm glad we did as we were pleasantly surprised by the excellent service. Their Wanna Get Away rates were the best, as always. The check-in people and crew were very friendly and our four flights were all on time. On our return, we were delayed an hour due to severe thunderstorms in our flight path. That was understandable, but we were late for our connection in Baltimore. Southwest knew of our problem and held the plane for us and our luggage. We were very happy when our luggage was there when we arrived in Hartford. But most impressive was the way both return pilots handled the planes as we passed through strong turbulence on both flights. It was rough, but the pilots came through beautifully. Overall, the experience was very good and my confidence in Southwest is back!"
Southwest Airlines,I always flew Southwest but lately Two Thumbs Down,1,"I always fly Southwest but lately, i have to admit, I am not thrilled. One would think after the fiasco last December with cancelling a ton of fights, Southwest would up their games, not so. I always pay extra for Early Bird, but Early Bird so it seems does not really get you anything. It is a computerized random selection of how you end up in the line. That is like going to a restaurant, paying for a Steak but you may get hot dog and sausage. The sad part, Southwest at Hobby Airport and at their customer center were completely indifferent. I am not what happens to their leadership at the top, but the lack of it is filtering all the way down to their front line operation. It is not about the $50 but if i wanted to gamble, I would go to a casino, not southwest. I paid for something and I di did not get it; they refuse to refund it, even though I spoke with them before the flight."
Southwest Airlines,We take pride and stand by our right to inconvenience you,1,If you get a text stating your flight is delayed...IGNORE IT since they can still board and leave at the original time. They claim the text is a courtesy notice to leave you stranded which happened to my husbands flight today from Tampa to Denver...text said flt 1110 was departing at 1:38pm instead of 11:40am...it left at 12:04pm.
Southwest Airlines,Southwest Airlines is the best airline,5,"Southwest Airlines is the best airline. We recently experienced a maintenance issue during one of our connecting flights. However, the Southwest staff handled the situation with exceptional professionalism and provided us with an alternate plane. To our surprise, we received an email this morning informing us that they would be sending a voucher as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience, without us even having to request it. This is a prime example of how a business should operate. I am grateful that I chose Southwest Airlines and will continue to choose them in the future because they truly deserve it."
Southwest Airlines,BUYER BEWARE,1,BUYER BEWARE! Early check in fees are non-refundable. I learned the hard way and thank goodness it was only $25. Everyone should know this before adding the early check-in. Very customer unfriendly!
Southwest Airlines,Early bird check in is not worth it!!!!!,1,I paid for early bird check in and ended up having to check myself in. I ended up with the same boarding others that flew in the same group as I that didn't pay the extra fee. Customer service pretty much said there is nothing they can do. What is the point of charging an extra fee@Southwest?!
Southwest Airlines,DO NOT FLY THIS AWFUL AIRLINE,1,"This company is awful. Flew to sf for a wedding. Our flight was delayed 4 hrs. No rain no snow, just delayed due to incompetence? Then on the flight back another delay of 2 hours. They didn't have enough overhead bin space for everyone and the ghetto flight attendance started grabbing bags and slamming them in trying to fit things. They broke a souvenir I got... what an awful company. Of all the airlines this had been the worst by far and hope they go under soon."
Southwest Airlines,Group Travel Tickets,1,"I booked a group travel ticket for 10 people and when I made the reservation over the phone, I paid the required $500 deposit at the same time. After I made the payment, I received an email that the deposit was non-refundable and I needed to make the final payment by May 2023. I went in today (5/18/2023) to make the final payment and was told that my reservation was cancelled because I did not make the payment by May 5 and that my deposit was forfeited. This is a scam - DO NOT make your deposit payment at the same time you make your reservation. Be sure to obtain the contract before forking out any money and read the very, very fine print carefully and several times. Better yet, fly a different airline!!"
Southwest Airlines,The Only Airline to Fly!,5,"I have always loved Southwest. I feel like one of those 'loyal to the brand' types of people. They are SO accommodating to families after we had our newborn on 3 flights. If I can fly Southwest, I WILL!"
Southwest Airlines,SWA Is Just Like All The Rest,1,"We had a bit of a flight-booking panic in January 2024 as we were packing for our upcoming trip the next day. I remembered booking a flight for my partner; however, we could not find the reservation.

I looked on my account and my partner’s, but the reservation was not listed. We were headed to work an event that we could not miss. So we had to purchase a last minute flight for $465 as missing work would have wasted three months of preparation.

My partner received an email the next day stating that their reservation had been cancelled. This was for the flight that I had initially booked that didn’t appear on either of our accounts, and we could not find.

I contacted Southwest by phone and was referred to their customer service email support system and they responded coldly nine days later by simply quoting their policy on FRIDAY afternoon! SWA/Donna, can you please NOT give devastating news on Friday?

SWA Case#: 84809854

Sad to say, but like most corporations today, once they’ve got your money, you are not important. I think I’m going to drive from now on."
Southwest Airlines,Don't pack anything fragile!,3,"I think there are some things that they can upgrade, but TSA and security were amazing, and all of the employees were friendly. The thing that I think they can improve is luggage care. When I was on a plane to KC I saw that the guys who were putting luggage into planes were NOT careful at all, plus this is how they broke my wheel on the suitcase, they tossed it, then the wheel snapped right off. 3/5 for this one."
Southwest Airlines,One flight was canceled without any…,1,"One flight was canceled without any reason given. Another flight was delayed but not canceled. Minors were on board. When mother attempted to get gate pass, staff told her there were no flights and were extremely rude."
Southwest Airlines,So done with Southwest,1,"So done with Southwest, booked a flight to Tampa 4/27/23, got a text flight delayed 25 min, ok no big deal, get to the airport, park the car, go through security, get on the tram and by the time I got off the tram another text saying flight was cancelled!!!! Seriously, lame excuse saying problem in Tampa with air traffic control, but funny no other airline cancelled going to Tampa! They rebooked me for 5:45 am next day, should I go next day and have that cancelled too? why and issue one day but resolved next morning? I already had to pay for parking and drive 45 minutes to home again! Now I have to fight for my money back because I used points from another flight I had to cancel due to covid! Of course no one could explain what the problem was in Tampa, typical southwest internal issues that were to be upgraded, but probably were not. I will NEVER trust them again or fly Southwest, save your selves the aggravation people and use another airline!! Done! I want a check sent for my points! flight confirmation #3VDADL"
Southwest Airlines,Cancelled Again and for the Last Tim,1,"The last 2 times we have flown Southwest our return flights have been cancelled, causing us to have to rebook on another airline costing us over 1k each time. This last time we ever fly with the airline, they delayed our flight 3 times before finally cancelling not allowing enough time to rebook for the same day. They rebooked us 2 days after our original flight stranding us in Orlando, luckily we have friends in the area but cannot say additional days, they cancel leaving their passenger stranded for days needing to find new accommodations. We gave them a second chance and regret it, they should be reimbursing passengers for stranding them. All other flights went out just ours was cancelled this is not acceptable, we will be spending all our rewards on other things and shutting our rewards account and credit card down this week. Will NEVER Fly then again."
Southwest Airlines,The customer service is absolutely the…,1,"The customer service is absolutely the worst. Due to weather issues in Dallas we have been stuck in Phoenix for an extra 4 days so far... They canceled the last flight and rebooked us. I received a text at 2:22am. The flight was at 5:35am day after tomorrow. Had I been sleeping, I would not only not been able to check in 24 hours prior but what was supposed to be a non stop flight they changed to a stop, changing planes and a layover. When I called the agent was so rude."
Southwest Airlines,Straightforward fares,4,"This airline is quite straightforward, you know what you will pay and there are no hidden fees. Plus the 2 checked in luggage pieces are an advantage"
Southwest Airlines,I can’t fly to Chicago for two days due…,1,"I can’t fly to Chicago for two days due to a rescheduled flight!!!
for the first time we got on a plane and everyone just dropped us off and said that you were leaving tomorrow! and the next day they promised a direct flight to Chicago, but again they outplayed everything and changed the flight 3-4 hours before departure! Now I need to fly with a transfer to Dallas! I also have my own business, job, family waiting for me at home! I paid money for this! Is this an airline or a taxi on call?! If you are saving your time, don't fly with this airline!!"
Southwest Airlines,My daughter got up at 3 am to catch an…,5,"My daughter got up at 3 am to catch an early flight to Portland. She had her carry on, and little dog in her carrier, her cell phone, passport, jacket etc., She met her ride, and turned over her dog to him, and put her carry on in his car. Then went back to pick up her luggage. Hearing her name paged to go to security, they had found her purse! It was left behind on the seat. It had some ID and all of her cash. Everything was still in it. She tried to tip the security but he refused. Great customer service. Thank you so much. Would definitely fly Southwest with employees like this kind person."
Southwest Airlines,Never on time anymore,1,"My last four flights on SWA have been delayed extensively. Once a very efficient carrier to fly, they slid into the Spirit/Frontier pool in my opinion"
Southwest Airlines,Stranded at my expense,1,"Flight delay 2 hours 40 minutes. Was told by gate agent delay was due to having to wait on connecting passengers the prior flight, so it backed up. Told to “wait” as they had zero flights via any connections available. No one announced jack. Went up to get status and was told no way to get back home for two DAYS. This is a sunny day on the frickin’ West Coast! I lost important medical appointment, major business meeting, etc. The solution was ship me to another AIRPORT at my expense and a hotel at MY expense. I complained over this and was told it was a “weather” issue and I would not get a voucher for anything! I told them what the agent told me - a schedule delay on SW’s part…I was of course dismissed. I am now stuck at a hotel at my expense, moved back to the original airport, two rebooking, and an 8 hour layover tomorrow (hopefully) just to get a total of a three-hour flight back. There was a lot more. I will never fly Southwest again, and I plan on filing a formal complaint."
Southwest Airlines,Fly them all the time...not any more,1,"Fly them all the time. Flying today and the flight attendant forced me to remove my bag from the overhead for someone whos bag was too big to fit under the seat. The person came on late with 2 bags. I had one, but they made mw move mine. Im well over 6ft tall.and this left me with no leg room to stretch. Usually I can stretch out with my legs under the seat in front of me but not today. If thats how Southwest wants to treat loyal customers, I will fly someone else"
Southwest Airlines,Don’t fall for the delayed baggage line they give you,2,"I arrived in Orlando 2 hours early for my flight to Columbus. Was told at desk since I was more than an hour early I had to leave my bags with an overweight young lad with his shirt out and a F you attitude. I put my golf bag on a cart , he took my suitcase and threw it on the floor inside a room. Upon arrival in Columbus, I got my golf bag but not my suitcase. Along with 27 others who were missing luggage. We were told by the baggage people to fill out a form and when the luggage arrived we could either pick it up (along with a $300 certificate) or they would bring it to us THAT NIGHT. I live 2 hours away. I chose for them to deliver it. When they called and said they had it, and confirmed my address (which I had already done with their worthless online app), I was told I was outside their delivery area and I could either come pick it up or they’d have Fed Ex deliver in three days. I’m working next three days so I can’t go get it. Half the clothes I have are in that suitcase. I have one appropriate outfit to wear the next three days to work. It was not my fault they missed 28 bags (probably due to that young boys lackadaisical attitude. Their customer service sucks"
Southwest Airlines,Damaged my luggage and wont replace it,1,"Damaged my luggage and wont replace it. Threw it around and busted everything in it. My handle wont extend. Ill stick with delta!!! You get what you pay for, no wonder Southwest are cheap. Employees dont care!"
Southwest Airlines,The sky is the limit…,4,"Overall, a descent airline all things considered- but then again travel isn’t what it use to be… in my most humble but accurate opinion, the enjoyment, the experience of flying to see family, or the excitement of taking a vacation to someplace where you’ve never been, is lacking. More like being a seat assignment than a passenger. And certainly cellphone phones have added significantly to the equation of making us a very impersonal society."
Southwest Airlines,Disgusting!,1,"Sitting and reading the new celebration about giving fat people more seats and refuse ordinary families boarding, because a fat person had to get their seats.
Not gonna happen and hope Southwest Airline will be sued out of business for this disgusting policy!"
Southwest Airlines,Avoid this Airline at all cost,1,This is the worst Airline I’ve ever flown with. Southwest Airlines should be ashamed of themselves for how bad they are doing business. First of all we paid for our flight tickets and selected certain seats in certain areas. Now as usual before boarding the plane you have to wait until the attendant announces the zone area that you will be seated in. So if all that is the normal procedure then why on earth do I have to play musical chairs when I get on the plane. If I paid for a window seat than I expect a window seat not a middle seat for 4 hours. That is a sad surprise for a customer and I couldn’t even sit together with my wife. I purchased two seats that was together so what changed when we got on the plane? That was awful and terrible and no one had any clear answers for me. I will never fly with this airline again. And I will make it my mission to tell as many people as I possibly can to avoid you as well.
Southwest Airlines,Southwest?! More like SouthWorst!,1,"My luggage was delayed, causing me having to spend extra funds and make an additional round trip to the airport the next day. The agent on the night we arrived promised me that Southwest would handle my complaint swiftly and reimburse me for all my extra costs. Instead, Southwest has ignored the receipts I sent (including an extra day of parking fees, Uber, and missing brand new sunscreen) and the documentation showing my round trip the next day to the airport and back. All they do is make unrelated replies, which allows them to reset the clock another thrity days. Then when I call, I get the response, ""Well sir, we have 30 days to respond to any messages you send, no matter our response."" Southwest has rightfully earned the nickname SouthWorst. Even the intial response from Sumi in customer service states that he is sorry there was a delay to my luggage. He instructed me to attach all supporting documents for reimbursement. I did that. Then after finally responding after 30 days, he said, ""Please attach a photo of the damaged luggage."" Um what?!?!?! Yeah, they are there to play games with customers. I've been our over $141 for over month because of SouthWorst delaying my luggage. I've been such a loyal customer to them. Time to give Delta a try."
Southwest Airlines,"Double charged for same flight, horrible customer service.",1,"I missed my flight due to auto problems, then when I got to the airport, the agent booked me for the next flight. Except she didn't book my second leg, or my return flights, and didn't tell me. At the gate I asked the gate agent about my connecting flight and the guy said I didn't have one. So he booked that for me, but didn't book a return flight, and he didn't tell me that. I guess, stupid me, I assumed those jerks would know I have to get back home and paid for a round trip fare. A couple days later when I didn't see a ""check in"" email for my return flight. I called and they said I didn't have a return flight and would have to pay another $198 to fly back. So I got double charged for the exact same flight because two agents screwed up. Their customer service/complaints people basically told me to go pound sand, it's just policy. What crap. I've never been treated so badly by an airline, and I fly a ton. That's it for southwest. I'm taking my business elsewhere."
Southwest Airlines,best,5,"One of the best airlines for me at least, never had a problem with the airline, always had the best experience with southwest."
Southwest Airlines,I and my wife aged 70+ were travelling…,1,"I and my wife aged 70+ were travelling from Raleigh to Buffalo on 22nd Dec 2022 by Southwest airlines. All the flights were cancelled to Buffalo, and the only option was to travel to Syracuse via Baltimore. The 2 checked in bags containing our winter clothes, our life saving diabetic medicine (Rublesus) and gifts for granddaughter whom we were meeting after 3 years were supposed to be in the same flight to Syracuse. The flight for Syracuse from Baltimore was initially scheduled at 5:30 PM which was delayed for no reason but to pick up passengers from other connecting flights. The flight to Baltimore actually left at 2AM on 23rd Dec. I had to request my son to drive from Beamsville to Syracuse. The bags did not arrive, and we filed a lost baggage claim.
6 days later still don’t have our bags, nor can get anyone to answer the phone. Unless they compensate those, who got screwed out of missing Christmas with family, lifesaving medicines, presents that are in suitcases that have vanished, I will never fly this airline again and not recommend anyone to fly. Southwest, take a small fraction of the millions of dollars you make off of us every year and do the right thing. If you care. Also make the compensation quicker to save some family bonding."
Southwest Airlines,Southwest Delay - keeps upcharges,1,"Southwest flight was delayed on leg one; I had paid early bird fee and had an A Grp boarding pass.

SW rebooked for free but went from A to C on that first leg and A to B on the second leg - which was the same flight from the original itinerary.

Of course they kept my money.

Lesson here - don’t drink the SW Kool Aide. Don’t buy upgrades - good chance it’ll just be a looser.

Southwest Airlines,I flew to Chicago,1,"I flew to Chicago, worked in a non cell working area. Worked time went over with no access to call southwest and change flight. They took it as a no show and said nothing they could do. So no access to call them was a good reason. No sympathy for the customer situation. On the flight here my bags where over weight by one pound and they demanded $100 surcharge. I had to sit there and adjust my bags to clear the one pound. Then at boarding I get hit again about my bags overweight issue of one pound. That almost made me mis my flight. The plane was half empty from Texas to Chicago. So I stripped Southwest as a vendor in my company. By being treated this way they do not realize what this cost them in additional revenue. They will not get it from me."

Hopefully you have a great and bless day and thanks once again for being who you are a genuine kindhearted person we wish you all the best and keep doing what you’re doing and that’s being great"
Southwest Airlines,Heartless and incompetent worst airline I’ve ever dealt with,1,"Is there a way to give less than one star? I attempted to cancel my flight WITHIN 24 hours during massive storms, and I couldn’t cancel it on the app. So I thought ok, I’ll call. How hard could that be. I was on hold for hours. When I finally got someone, they told me it was just past 24 hours (which was their fault for the wait times and the fact their app was down) and to contact complaints. I tried complaints, who sent an email saying tough luck and gave no way to respond. I tried chatting in. Tried calling in again to talk to a supervisor. They said “we don’t have supervisors.” Abominable service, and the reason I had to change my flight was due to a family member who was extremely sick, as I told Southwest. Airline with a heart? Worst airline I’ve dealt with. Don’t expect help or humanity from them."

Southwest Airlines,Southwest Crew -Cancun to Atlanta,5,"The 1135 Southwest flight from Cancun ti Atlanta was significantly delayed. Fortunately we were met with an understanding, courteous, and professional crew of flight attendants that served us with polite responses to the delays, emphathtic engagement about the delays, and went beyond the call of duty to provide updates about connecting flights that were on time, gone, or delayed. The fact that they even provided instructions to assist the passengers with missed connections was just an amazing act of kindness. Some customers were very rude about the delays and but your team of flight attendants met their negativity with professional grace and positivity while explaining the delays to the best if their abilitity. The level of humor, engagement, quality service, professionalism, and empathy was wonderful. Please celebrate and congratulate the following crew for an AMAZING job done: Celestine Armstead, Derric Allen Rogers, and Phillip Jefferey Sorel! Please donʼt forget the pilot team as well: Captain Leon Boyd Newman Jr. and Flight Officer Christian Winford Barnes! Thanks again for an excellent job done in the mist of a difficult situation that was out of their control. I Love Southwest!"
Southwest Airlines,Delays,1,Delays. Constant delays. Told we were leaving several times. Lined up repeatedly just to be informed of another delay.
Southwest Airlines,We were involuntarily bumped from our…,1,"We were involuntarily bumped from our flight. Come to find out that Early Bird Checkin isn't really a checkin, it holds your boarding position, but doesn't count as a checkin, so we were last in the checkin list since we printed our boarding passes when we got to the airport. This meant we were the last to checkin and the first to get bumped for an oversold flight. The advertise and push early bird, but don't tell you this key information. Rather deceptive marketing to make a quick buck.

Meanwhile, our luggage took off without us, leaving us stranded in Denver, with sub freezing temperatures and no winter jacket because we put those in our checked luggage since overhead and carryon space is always a problem. They stole our luggage and stranded us without proper clothing in a harsh climate.

They gave us a check for the inconvenience and rebooked us for the next day, but doesn't help when we don't have jackets and have to expose ourselves to the cold to get to the shuttle and find a hotel.

Our rebooked flight was cancelled and rebooked, but if I wasn't checking my email, I would not have known and been able to properly checkin again.

The gate people did not provide us with a printed document explaining our rights as they should in accordance with DOT requirements, let alone could not tell us the base price of our leg for that flight in the refund they issued.

They don't care about customers, just about filling their planes to make a buck."

This message regarding Southwest Airlines ticket counter extension. I miss my first flight to visit Nashville Tn. So I was put on standby, ones I learned that I was to put on the next. I had to go get my new ticket from the customer service. That’s where I’ll meet Mr. David who was not friendly or nice at all. Mr. David had to re-inform dad how lucky I was that I was not supposed to be on this flight either but someone showed up late as well. My reply was oh I’m so sorry to hear that. Thank you so much for helping me he reply he just make sure you get on this flight. I’ll reply back to let Mr. David know that I will be sitting here and will not miss this flight. His response was a model silence. For customer service to do their job with a smile on their face when people like myself pay good money to fly with Southwest and get a Southwest experience when we fly south with respect to the customer service skills. Thank you once again, Mr. David."
Southwest Airlines,Large luggage on plane,5,"I like to choose my seat I have a problem that the people that choose to bring on large carry on
should seat where they want but wait to get off at the end.then others don't get hurt and we have to wait for our luggage at careacell so they can wait too. They are rude sometimes and don't care. Lock the above luggage holder until every one that doesn't have luggage over head gets off.it used to be small luggage now it's larger suit case. And take a long time to wait. Some of us can't use the rest rooms until we get off so that makes it hard too. Had one woman pushing you back so she can get her luggage that behind her where she sit while we are trying to get off being rude while she could had waited. Making a big sence in front of people pushing me back and putting others people in front of me just being mean. She told me to wait I told her I needed to get to the restroom so she just made it harder for me be cause she was just being mean."
Southwest Airlines,Discriminates against people of size,1,"I was at the Clev boarding gates and the gentlemen said my purchased 2nd seat wasn’t printed properly and kept my boarding pass but he would bring it to me once corrected. Got on and the plane nothing to hold my 2nd seat & couldn’t get the attention of the flirty flighty stewardess at the front to advise. Once the plane was COMPLETELY full the guy from boarding gates came and loudly announced to the couple next to me that one of them had to move to another flight due to that seat already being purchased . After they questioned him since they were there and seating is fcfs - he LOUDLY announced Infront of entire plane “it’s because of her size it’s a safety issue”. The entire plane laughed and talked about me the entire flight saying I should have been made to get off. I cried the entire flight home of embarrassment since my weight is due to no thyroid (a MEDICAL CONDITION!) SW promised me a LUV voucher for my “inconvenience” which was routed to the wrong email (not one on my complaint) and then refused to deal with any further . I am advising PLEASE avoid SW if you are of size !! When I flew American in the past , they were much more understanding and private in their interactions about my second seat purchase. SW ruined my self esteem and created any future flying with a traumatic experience worrying the same will happen again. SW was very blatant and care less about discriminating against someone of size."

Southwest Airlines,Southwest Hotels is the WORST,1,"Southwest Hotels provided the worst, most botched up hotel reservation experience of my life, and I'm a 63-yr-old frequent traveler, so that takes some doing!

In mid-March booked a hotel stay for 5 nights in June in Orange County. Received confirmation of the booking by Southwest, who was usin Agoda search engine. All seemed fine; Southwest even emailed me about the upcoming stay more than once to make sure I was organized. Then, we arrive on the day, and there is no booking in the hotel's system. An hour on the phone in the hotel lobby (mostly on hold) with Southwest Concierge, and finally they tell me they had a problem getting the payment that was successfully charged to my credit card in March to the hotel.
No attempt to contact me. No attempt to fix it and find me another hotel. No offer of points for my trouble or.to compensate me in any way for the stress and inconvenience they caused me and my partner. Just s lame apology from the poor sap at the call center and an ""offer"" to refund me the money charged to my credit card in March in 7-10 business days.

Southwest needs to GET OUT of the business of hotel booking, as a look in google shows their performance is horrendously bad. I will never use this joke of a service again, and neither should anyone who wants to be able to trust that their hitel confirmation actually IS a confirmation without having to follow up behind the booking agency.

For your peace of mind, I recommend you AVOID SOUTHWEST HOTELS ENTIRELY and Use Booking.com instead. That's who I turned to to secure a hotel stay at the last minute. I've used them dozens of times with no issues like this. Until Southwest Hotels can get its act together, it is likely to cause you grief."
Southwest Airlines,Customer Service Assistance,5,"On Sunday, May 14 (Mother's Day) I was researching info for my 2 80+ yearly friends that were flying to Long Beach on Thursday, May 17. They both had request wheelchairs both directions, but I was trying to find the protocol when they arrived at Long Beach, CA as it doesn't have a pull-up ramp but deplane using stairs. My male friend will not be able to do that as his legs not strong enough. KEYSHA, Houston reservationist, did not know , but made several telephone calls while I was on hold to get the proper information. Her willingness to go beyond answering the phone; her constant checking to see if I was still on HOLD; and her desire to make sure I received the proper information was so much appreciated. It is so frustrating not to be able to find the right number to call for my answer, but was relieved to find a person willing to go beyond Thank you KEYSHA for you help. FYI, my husband and I have been lucky that all our SW flights have been great and the men at the outside curb-service have been more than wonderful I recently flew from Cambodia to San Francisco (4/15) and I believe Arthur at curb-service was incredible for me and my 2 friends. I needed a wheelchair and he ran inside to get one so I didnt have to stand there. The 3 of us were so exhausted due to our long flight. Then, I had a wonderful wheelchair assistant to take me the rest of the way. I have nothing but positive comments to make about Southwest"

Southwest Airlines,Our flight was canceled due to weather…,5,"Our flight was canceled due to weather from Denver >Milwaukee. I made a mistake on how I booked our flight out. Which was over $740.00, but I was told to just call customer service & I’d get my money back. The next day when I called the I-FLY-SWA # I told the representative the situation (3) times
She replied all 3 times “we don’t refund for flights already taken” So thinking she was just having a rough day I hung up. I immediately called again and got a rep. 1. That listened to my situation, 2.put me on hold to ask what to do. & 3. When she came back on, she said she understands the issue,& opened a claim report and SW would research the situation.YEAH, within 4 days I received a call that I would receive a full refund. And 2 weeks later I received all my money for the flight I booked unwittingly. KUDOS to Southwest for understanding and refunding my money. I know I didn’t follow prodigal but it is stressful when a flight is canceled, and I did what I thought was correct. but again SW thank you
It did cost me 1 nights stay in a hotel as Southwest does not pay for a room if weather related but that was minimal compared to the 747.00 flight.
So despite the 1st.call, I STILL give SW a 5 STAR rating.! For knowing we are all human."

Southwest Airlines,We were traveling to Fla to board a cruise,1,"We were traveling to Florida. to take a cruise when our luggage was delayed on our Southwest flight and forwarded to Birminghm Alabama. as detailed in our report We were delayed so long trying to find our luggage and then completing a report (MCOWN45135309) that we missed our cruise. By the way this was a direct flight from Syracuse to Orlando, we never changed planes.
Initially we thought we would have time to gather some belongings as suggested by the baggage manager at southwest and we attempted to do so. If anyone has tried to gather belongings in a strange town and with limited time to buy clothing for 7 days at sea they know this an impossible task, not to mention all our medications were stored in our checked baggage. While looking for some essential items the cruise ship contacted us letting us know they would be closing the doors in 15 minutes and sailing. This was much earlier than expected. We were still 1 hour away and could not make it to the terminal on time. After explaining this to the baggage manager he demanded the compensation check back and booked us on the next flight home. Southwest refuses to compensate us for anything other than 2 pieces of toilet paper callled $200 dollar vouchers. we are out over $5000. After numerous emails and phone calls, updating claims as suggested by the phone rep., Southwest continues to claim we cancelled our vacation! NO, we were forced to cancel due to missing our cruise ship due to thier incompetence. Southwest customer service is below a 1 star and does nothing to help, just puts the blame on the customer continuing to claim we cancelled our trip.... They also hide behind emails so they do not have to deal directly with the customer."
Southwest Airlines,STILL BETTER THAN ANY OTHER AIRLINE!,5,"Our recent trip to and from BWI with layovers at MDW was delay-free. And even though a previous return flight from PDX was cancelled due to a major storm system back East, Customer Service gave us three options to return the next day. Airlines cannot control the weather, especially huge storm systems which can and do disrupt their operations nationwide.
But they can control the remaining causes, including extended I.T. ""melt-downs,"" mechanical issues, and crew scheduling.
Due to the widespread impact of the Covid epidemic, Southwest clearly failed to accurately predict the increase in demand for new pilots and the timing to retrain sufficient pilots returning from lay-off. The result continues to be a lack of adequate staffing, resulting in additional cancellations.
And as for the several major I.T. ""melt-downs,"" I am sure that Southwest would admit there is no excuse.
But despite all of this, basis my past and present experience with each and every Southwest employee, there is absolutely no comparison between Southwest and any other domestic airline, period."
Southwest Airlines,This company went downhill,1,"This company went downhill. First of all, the ticket counter made us get rid of stuff to board the plane. We left our personal things at the ticket counter worth over an estimated $400 dollars because we were a few pounds over company policy. After fumbling around the ticket counter for an hour, we almost miss our flight. My family (wife, infant, toddler) had to run to the departure booth. The manager at Myrtle Beach airport for southwest was extremely rude and mean. She deserves to be be fired! We were about to board the plane and she made us take things out of our bags (again!) and move things around saying we had too much stuff. We had just been hassled at the ticket booth and dropped our stuff on the curb. The manager and her ticket collector tried to charge us for the baby carrier. The manager and her staff at Myrtle Beach international airport were burned out, disrespectful and mean. We finally get on the flight and the male flight attendant gave me a sarcastic remark ""you know, we allow free checked bags right?"" Talking to me as if I did not know and I'd rather carry all my family stuff on carry on. “We are moving, and not on a vacation and had maxed out on checked bags,” I said. I should not have to defend my self to smart remarks on the plane. Of course no flight attendants helped with our luggage while I had a baby and and infant. One of my bags was ripped when I received the bag in New York. I then had to buy a $65 dollar bag to cover the ripped bag on my connection. Of course the new bag also ripped receiving on the next airport. Absolute horrible flying experience."
Southwest Airlines,Frequent flyer on Southwest no more!,1,"I am 47 years old and a frequent flyer on Southwest. I have never encountered this kind of customer service on any airline before in my life.

Barry is the name of the flight attendant that yelled at my 3 yr old daughter. She was sitting at the window seat. I was sitting in the aisle seat and my wife was in between us.

I woke up to Barry leaning over me with his head right in front of my face yelling forcefully and directly to my 3 yr old daughter. My wife was in shock and froze.

My daughter had put some decorative children’s tape on the window and seat in front of her. It peels off very easily. It’s one of several plane activities my wife had prepared for our young daughter. We removed the tape immediately.

I don’t mind Barry asking me to remove the children’s tape or for my daughter not to put children’s decorative tape on the window and seat but his tone was intimidating and scary. His aggression toward my 3 yr old daughter was uncalled for, rude, and embarrassing. He is a loose canyon.

I could hear others around me talking about how he acted and I decided to try and say something to him.

Next time he came around, I politely tried to suggest to him that he did not need to use that tone with my 3 yr old daughter. He immediately snapped cutting me off and said something like, “if you don’t like it, write a letter to Southwest”. I couldn’t believe it.

I had tried to ask him nicely and he was doubling down. He continued, “this is not your property, if you think it is ok to deface someone else’s property, then write a letter to Southwest”.

I was calm and was trying to talk to him discreetly, but he was loud and made a scene.

I said, “I didn’t say anything about WHAT you said, I’m talking about ‘how’ you said it”. He did not seem to understand the distinction.

He said, “I don’t have time for this. If you have a problem with what I said, write a letter to Southwest”

It was a very unpleasant experience and I hope no one else has to go through that."
Southwest Airlines,Your money is important,1,"I purchased $1,500 worth of gift cards from a third party for Southwest airlines to use for our honeymoon. When I went online to use the electronic gift cards for the trip we had been looking at, the codes generated by Southwest airlines were no good. You see on Southwest gift cards you need 19 digits they only generated 16 digits so my gift cards were of no use. When I was finally able to get my money back for the gift cards from the original vendor the prices had increased and the promotions had changed. Our original trip to Mexico was going to cost about $700 per person in the trip now is between 1,000 and 1,100. After 2 weeks of trying to reach someone at Southwest that could help me I was told that there is nothing that they can do to honor the price I was going to originally purchase them at. I told them that the error and mistake was on their part and they should be liable and be able to honor the original price we were looking at. They are refusing to help but have the audacity to tell me that I'm a valued customer and that they are more than willing to help me if I agree to play 7 to 800 dollars more for the same trip. With all of the problems Southwest airlines has had in the last 4 to 6 months you think they would try to do a little bit more to help the consumer. Go to Expedia or funjet tours or any other tour company to book your trip."
Southwest Airlines,LIARS,1,"LIARS! Cant perform

Passengers started left and right. Its not weather people, its staffing!!!!"
Southwest Airlines,The flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix…,3,"The flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix was beautiful and have no complaints there. But at Sky Harbor airport at Baggage Claim my suitcase is purple and it's a plastic one with a pink name tag. Also the zipper that you can open to expand doesn't zip all the way. So I saw my suitcase and grabbed it bc of those identifiers. About 20 minutes later southwest representative calls me and said I had the wrong suitcase and of course I was so embarrassed and my step dad takes me back to the airport we were 20 minutes away. I get there and was apologizing a lot. The one Southwest employee a black woman went off on me and I was blown away. It was uncalled for and she was about to be recorded. So then I explained to the male employee what through me off and he agreed when be looked at the suitcases side by side that zipper was like mine and the pink tag like mine
Yes I should have looked at my name and I learned a lesson from it. And the person who the suitcase belong to was so ignorant I understood she was upset I would be also. However when I'm apologizing and I legit felt bad the least she could have done was acknowledge that. And your employee yelling at me in front of people was the most disgusting way to treat people in that line of work. I'm 52 yrs old and worked in customer service my adult life and I have never treated anyone like that. I could give her a pass if i was ignorant to her. It's not like I was in the plane to another state I was 20 minutes away and I never touched the suitcase from putting it in the car. I landed at 7:05 pm from Pittsburgh to Sky harbor on Flight 3466. My name is Michelle Strachan and the black woman who is a southwest employee that yelled at me like a child in front of people should be dealt with because she will cause that airline more problems without a doubt. And it was a honest mistake that I felt bad about and please pay attention when a customer goes through something like that and is it in your policy to Tell your employees to yell at another adult who is not being disrespectful at all that it's acceptable that they act that way. I didn't record her but I almost did and it would have big a huge headache for your damage control team."
Southwest Airlines,Scabies,1,"Scabies! Need I say more?! Found this Hotel through Southwest Rapid Rewards Points and Booking.com. So I thought it might be OK for a 2 night stay.
1. First bad sign - When we arrived the ""lady"" at the desk laughed in our faces when I asked if there was a continental breakfast served.
2. Second bad sign she wanted $100 cash deposit even though the room was already paid for and reserved through Southwest and Booking.com.
3. Arriving at the room, the door and locks were apparently kicked it at least a couple of times, and the elevator walls were rotted out at the bottom.
4. The air conditioner really didn't work and kept turning on and off and took a full 12 hours to cool down the room even a little bit.
5. Went to the Soda machines and ALL were broken and not working, was sent to the Polynesian hotel next door (same owners) and their soda machines were broken as well.
6. After checking out, in the parking lot there was a family of ""immigrants"" staying at the hotel eating a watermelon with plastic spoons that was just sitting on the ground behind their car.
7. Upon arriving back in NY my wife and I began itching and breaking out with pustules all over our bodies. It looked like chicken pox. We went to 2 different Doctors and was asked if we stayed anywhere in a hotel within the last week??? We said ""Yes"" - To which they answered ""well now you have Scabies!""
Sooo - Thank you Southwest! and Thank you Booking.com! and Thank you Ocean Plaza of Myrtle Beach! Now we are tp endure weeks of suffering and medical treatment!
So my advice is ""stay at your own risk!"""
Southwest Airlines,conned out of Earlybird seating,2,Booked Roundtrip flights for September 2023. We had also purchased the early bird for both legs of the trip. When it came time 36hrs before flight to check in for seat assignments we received a notice that we could nt get seat assignments until 24 hrs and that Southwest would let us know are boarding numbers. Then we received and email that said they could upgrade us to A boarding if we paid another $50 a piece.... which added up to an additional $100 dollars each for both legs of flight. That was $200 extra for both of us.....on top of the $100 dollars we already paid for the earlier Early bird fee when we booked the flight. We booked our flights four months prior to departure. I tried to find out what was going on but no one would answer my questions. There were several passengers with the same issue. Southwest had decided to change the way they do the early bird and the increased fee without any prior notification. Tried to get answers to what was going on from boarding person but she told me to contact the airlines directly. had to email because no one answered the phones and I was told sorry but there was nothing they could do since the fee's had changed literally like a day or two before our flight. I tried to get them to refund the early bird fee's that we had already paid earlier since we did not get early bird seating after all and could not pay an additional $200 at that point. Basically I was told there was nothing they could do. I have flown Southwest for many years but this last experience was enough to make me look elsewhere. To ask us to pay an additional $200 each for the flight.... was totally unreasonable. And I could have booked thru another airline for less than they wanted me to pay for the Southwest airlines increase and would have gotten assigned and reserved seats in the process. Will definitely being flying with another airline in the future
Southwest Airlines,Southwest Airlines,1,"Southwest Airlines - poorly trained reservation personnel, no communication when they created an issue, no customer service to resolve a problem they created.

We are sitting in the airport in San Jose, Costa Rica. Had booked our roundtrip flights in November. Art booked by calling Southwest directly as we were returning to the U.S. with our cat as carryon. I had checked the Southwest website, and Art told the agent when he was making the reservations that our cat was coming back with us. She charged an extra fee for the cat and said that the cat replaces one of our carryons.

Art called Southwest and confirmed our reservations , including the cat as we did not receive our expected email for priority check in, which had been paid for. Reservations confirmed.

We checked the Southwest app this morning, and our first leg, San Jose to Houston had disappeared. We called Southwest at 3am, and took awhile but Southwest person on the phone located our reservation, and had it fixed. She confirmed that the cat was on our reservation.

We get to the airport, and our first leg, Costa Rica to Houston had disappeared again. After checking, and bringing over a supervisor, they found out reservation - but told us that the cat was not allowed on an International flight. We were told we could fly, but not the cat. Despite first being booked directly on the phone with Southwest, and having two other phone conversations, including the cat flying with us - we were left standing at the San Jose, CR airport unable to board our flight.

Despite our asking, Southwest personnel would make no attempt to get us aboard a different airline to rectify this situation.

Terrible personnel training, no communication, and very poor customer service with a situation they created.

Luckily, we were able to get a flight out later today with JetBlue. Now will be up for 24 hours with the new flight. Poor Bramble will be in his carrier for almost as long ...."
Southwest Airlines,SOUTHWEST AIRLINES ASSAULT,1,"Onboard SOUTHWEST AIRLINES flight from Phoenix to Ft Lauderdale, just as the door closed to leave, I was assaulted by the Flight Attendant. As I was saying goodbye to my husband on my phone, a male flight attendant leaned past two passengers to jab his fingers into my shoulder. I was sitting in the window seat and suddenly felt pain in my shoulder from this male flight attendant's assault. I recently had rotator cuff surgery, and I was shocked that a man just poked me there. I am a 63 year old woman, and I pre-boarded due to disabilities. When I looked at him he said ""turn off your cell phone now"". The preparation announcements were just being made when this assault took place. As I said, I was telling my husband goodbye . With doors flying off, DEI hiring of pilots, and all the horrors of flying, I ALWAYS tell my husband I love him just before I take off. I did nothing wrong, and certainly, NO FLIGHT ATTENDANT HAS THE RIGHT TO JAB HIS HAND INTO ANYONE'S SHOULDER. Well, I contacted Southwest Airlines and they essentially called me a liar. (It took a month for a response from SWA) I provided them with full details and also a photograph of this flight attendant. Their delayed response was that the feedback of the crew member was that he did not recall. They quoted their policy: ""Once the entry doors are closed in preparation for pushback, cellular voice and data functions must be turned off"". So instead of being appalled and sorry for this assault, they implied somehow I did not know about turning off cell phones. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT, yet NO ONE SHOULD BE physically assaulted by a flight attendant. SWA doesn't have the right to lay hands on a passenger. My complaint was completely blown off, and swept under the rug by SWA. They ended the correspondence by ""We hope you  will fly Southwest Airlines again and that your support and confidence is very important to us"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Why would I fly them again after they physically assaulted me? So after they assaulted a 63 year old woman with disabilities they took no responsibility, They we're very clear that somehow it was my fault that I was assaulted. Well, I am done flying SWA. There are better airlines that value their passengers and treat their passengers with respect."
Southwest Airlines,Cheated out of over $711!!,1,"On 9/30/24 I was buying a ticket for my mom to come with me on a trip. After I purchased the ticket, I realized I had inadvertantly gotten a duplicate ticket for myself. My mistake, I really don't know how I missed putting in her details. I cancelled that ticket and was immediately going to buy her ticket , so I just did a flight credit. I put in her information and everything was going well until I tried to pay. I could not use the flight credit to pay for her ticket because the flight credit was in my name!! I saw that the credit was transferable, so we made her an account, transferred the credit and bought her ticket. On Oct 2nd we cancelled the ticket. As it was past the 24 hours for free cancelation and a refund she got a flight credit to transfer back to me since I paid for the ticket. She was unable to do this because you can only transfer one time. As a new user with Southwest I was unaware that when you get a flight credit you can only use it for a flight in your name. I thought that I would have a credit to use however I needed as it is my money. Then when we cancelled the flight and she was issued a credit I fully expected that I could have it transferred back to me. I'm sure that there are others who hadn't read the one time rule either. So, I find that Southwest doesn't care if they cheat you out of your own money!! First by issuing you flight credit that you can't use as you wish. It's my money, I should be able to purchase a ticket for anyone I want. Second by only allowing a one time credit transfer. I realize that it was my mistake in the first place not putting the ticket in her name, but it was a mistake. Southwest had the opportunity to rectify this when I called and when I filed a complaint. I didn't ask for a refund, I simply wanted the flight credit back in my name. So for an honest mistake, I have lost over $711. Had I purchased the first ticket in her name, when she cancelled and got a flight credit, she would've been able to transfer it to me no issues, as that would've been the one and only transfer. For those who would say have my mom give me $711 and she has a flight credit to use. She cannot afford that, which is why I was buying her ticket in the first place. It would hurt Southwest in no way, shape or form to simply return the flight credit back to me. They still get the $711 revenue. The paper trail is there. They can clearly see the mistake of the duplicate ticket and they obviously know how their 'rules' twist this mistake all around to cheat me out of $711. I will never fly Southwest again!! Buyer beware!!"
Southwest Airlines,I can't even begin to describe how…,1,I have had more than one issue with Southwest the past 3 times and am absolutely disgusted. I was forced to give up my seat to other people after I boarded first as an A class member. Then the airline lost my luggage on my flight home because it turns out they decided not to put it on the plane and when I was told it would arrive and I would be contacted I wasn't. I was called at 12am and woken up. Then I had booked a flight home Dec 22-29 to fly home after life saving surgery to spend Christmas with my family until my flight was canceled twice so I ended up having to spend Christmas alone and lost money due to paid appointments thanks to Southwest. I rebooted my flight and requested assistance which was not given after I specifically told them I couldn't lift per Dr. Orders but didn't get help until second time where I had to go through security again andI had to pay fora carry on bag. I was told I would get a flight credit due to SW canceling my trip because they sent my mom one. When I called to ask about it again they told me I don't get one after I had been waiting for the email I was promised. I am beyond disgusted as a customer and if the situation is not handled I will not be using SW again and will make sure to tell everyone I know not to use them either. They are a dishonest company who doesn't care about their customers or taking care of them as promised. I understand mistakes happen but what happened to me is not acceptable and won't be tolerated. I deserve respect and for SW to keep their word. That why I'm requesting the points I was promised not just for my flight cancelations due to weather but all the bs I was put through as well as money lost. I'm tired of being told no one will do anything for me. I have flown SW for 15yrs with no problems until recently when it been nothing but awful and I'm considering switching airlines from now on.
Southwest Airlines,What an absolute joke,1,"What an absolute joke. I don’t even know where to begin. This airline needs to be shut down immediately. They say they got their game together by the 2nd of January?! HAAA some continued comedic relief from this joke of an airline. My first flight was canceled in Indy after 3 hrs waiting in the airport then 3 hours on the plane and then disembarking. The next day I was on hold and hung up on by their stellar customer service for about 12 hours of my day. By the next day I was about 50% sure I had rebooked my flight out but obviously couldn’t get ahold of anyone to confirm and had the call dropped during my booking confirmation. By the next day, they had legitimately disconnected their customer service line. So I rented a car and drove 3 hours out of state with the hopes that I had a flight out. Upon arriving here I found out my flight was canceled again and that I was accidentally listed as a ‘no show’ after spending 3 hrs physically sitting on their plane, so I couldn’t be rebooked. No problem, I decided to drive the 18 hrs to my destination since I could no longer stand one more minute of hoping SW would throw me a bone. Now it’s been 9 days and I get to the airport in the hopes of flying home only to find out that without my consent SW had canceled my flight home and not only was I not refunded but I had to buy an additional ticket at the counter for a flight I’d already paid for making me almost miss this flight since even the counter agent couldnt understand what was going on with my ticket. I have a torn MCL and had to run the length of an entire airport to try to make this flight I had just booked. I’ve now paid for 3 flights with SW of which I’ve yet to fly any. I am a rapid rewards member and I have a SW credit card and compassion pass and at this point I want to cut all and any ties linking me or my money or time to this absolute circus of an ‘airline’. You don’t deserve any loyalty. You failed and you continue to fail."
Southwest Airlines,Attention Southwest passengers,1,"Attention Southwest passengers, please take a moment to read this important message to ensure you don't miss your flight. Allow me to share my recent experience that left me deeply disappointed. My boarding pass clearly stated that I needed to be on the plane by 3:20 PM, as the scheduled departure time was 3:32 PM. However, due to the disorganized nature of the TSA, it took an astonishing 45 minutes for me to place my personal belongings on the tray for scanning.

To compound the situation, the TSA officials encountered difficulties while scanning my daughter's belongings. As I anxiously watched the clock, it took them an additional 20 minutes to complete the task. Finally, I arrived at the gate at 3:13 PM, a respectable 7 minutes before the designated boarding time mentioned on my boarding pass. To my dismay, however, the door had already been closed, and I, along with approximately 8 other passengers who had faced similar delays with TSA, were denied boarding.

Consequently, I missed my flight to Ft Lauderdale and had to hastily book a flight to Orlando at 7 PM, which landed at 10:30 PM. On top of that, I had to endure a tiring 2.5-hour drive to WPB, knowing that I had work the next day. As a frequent traveler, missing a plane was a first for me, and it has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Southwest again.

What truly bewilders me is the stark contrast in treatment when delays occur. On numerous occasions, I have arrived on time only to experience flight delays for various reasons. As customers, we are expected to accept such inconveniences, but the differential treatment when delays happen to us is disheartening. Southwest has unequivocally lost my business.

To add insult to injury, I had to personally retrieve my luggage from the Ft Lauderdale airport since I was not eligible for free delivery. This entire experience has further deepened my dissatisfaction."
Southwest Airlines,SWA Rebooked Us then Stranded Us In Vegas,1,"Can I give zero stars? Southwest (now Southworst) rebooked us midflight (while we were in the air) because they ""expected"" we would miss our connection from Las Vegas to San Diego. But guess what?!? We made it to the gate (C21) as they were announcing ""last boarding call"" and the gate agent was STILL boarding passengers and the plane doors not yet closed. Then, gate agent ""Erika"" (who wears an ""aloha"" button but does not live aloha), refused to reissue boarding passes for myself, my wife and daughter plus another five or so passengers to whom SWA did the same thing. Erika tried saying there was a ""weight"" issue (but we know that's a lie!) and then said the ""higher ups"" said she could not give us boarding passes (passing the buck? Or a telling slip of the tongue?🤔). Then after waiting at the counter Erika told us ""the doors are closed."" They certainly were at that point because she stalled us on purpose.

Erika then called over Supervisor Polet N who also refused to provide ANY explanation why we were all denied boarding. When we (I, ok, yes I am a lawyer) pressed Polet N about rebooking us on another flight (on any airline as required by federal law - which Polet agreed she was required to do) she put on her fake and superficial ""SWA smile"" and said simply, ""we are not going to do that."" Polet did not even try. No LUV there!!!

Adding insult to injury SWA issued us a hotel voucher for the OYO Hotel (formerly the Hooters Hotel) which is a scuzzy, fleabag hotel that charges $40/ night and has $1 blackjack all day (that alone tells you everything you need to know about who SWA partners with!)

The only thing I can think of that makes any sense is that SWA rebooked us midflight because they (yes, there are actual people who make these decisions) did not want to have to reimburse us for the cost our tickets if we missed the connection because of THEIR ramp delay and they cared more about an ""on time"" departure from Vegas (which they can claim when the plane doors are closed and they push back from the gate) than they did stranding a half dozen passengers in Vegas on a Sunday night.

Oh, we did get $200 SWA LUV vouchers that we have to use within one year and only on another SWA flight - they really think I want to fly SWA again?!? But a voucher is better for the bottomline than paying for missed flights caused by the airline's delay.

In short, SWA screwed us and then did nothing to assist in correcting THEIR mistake. Instead they stranded us with no explanation."

Southwest Airlines,WORST AIRLINE,1,WORST AIRLINE! How can an obece fattass take 3 seats from a mother and her 11 year old child!
Southwest Airlines,Southwest Reservation System can’t handle TSA secondary screening,1,"TSA randomly selects people for a secondary screening at the gate, which is out of all airlines control. However, with most airlines assigned seating, this only affects the flight you are selected for the screening for and doesn’t affect your boarding. With Southwest’s check in and reservation system, getting selected for secondary screening means you are in for major issues. Southwest’s well rehearsed response by phone support, check in personnel and gate agents, for the multiple impacts, is that it is not our fault’. That you were selected by the TSA, not Southwest, so you get nothing from Southwest to help rectify the situation of getting a late C group number when you went to all the trouble to check in and your spouse on the same reservation gets A group.

It is true that it is TSA for being selected for the extra secondary security screening for the first flight. However, all the issues on subsequent connecting fights are caused by Southwest's reservation system and boarding process. There is no reason not to get assigned your legitimate place in line on the rest of your connecting flights as the TSA screening has nothing to do with them. Even worse then not being able to board with the rest of your party on the reservation on subsequent flights, is losing your TSA Pre Check from paying for Global Entry on the rest of your connecting flights. On international flights you usually need to go through security again after clearing customs. On my recent trip back from Mexico, the rest of my party with TSA Pre Check cleared security in 5 minutes and then waited another 50 minutes for me to finally show up. This is very much Southwest's issue. Other airlines with different reservation systems have none of these issues.

There are things that Southwest could have and should have done on my connecting flight. I clearly should have had an A group number as all other folks on the reservation with me did. All the numbers are gone since the Southwest system would not assign my connecting flight boarding position since it wouldn’t assign the 1st flight. However, Southwest lets ""special circumstance"" folks board after the A group, before the B group. When I asked the gate agent in Miami, Monica V., if there was anything I could do to board at least close to the rest of my party, she parroted the party line that is was TSA’s fault and that there was nothing she could do. When I mentioned boarding after the A’s, she got that hostile look like I was just another low life trouble maker trying to cheat my way onto the plane before my turn. She stated that was ONLY for disabled passengers and my issue was not a Southwest problem.

An even better solution is for Southwest to still issue you your boarding position number for your connecting flights and not remove TSA PRE from your connecting flight boarding pass"
Southwest Airlines,Value for money,4,"Overall, I think they provide value for money. Their website is the fastest in the industry and easy to use."
Southwest Airlines,SW did not honor expired voucher they…,1,"SW did not honor expired voucher they told me they would. Left stranded at BDL Windsor Locks Hartford Connecticut airport late evening with my 2 children. No customer service or employees at gate or ticket counter. They canceled flight due to engine trouble, an hour wait on board with poor air circulation. One single SW staff member was available to print vouchers for those who waited in line. Delaying us another hour and a 1/2 expecting a refund. However, a credit voucher was all they were willing to accommodate. Thankfully, American Airlines got us home safely for a third less of the cost than Southwest charged me for the 14 day advanced purchase tickets aquited weeks prior to our flight. When I receive my vouchers I recognize the ""expires 1 year from now statement"" on the ticket and brought that to the attention of the rep who printed it and handed it to me. She stated (to the effect) ""Just ignore that they don't go by that, they'll honor it"" My vouchers remained on my refrigerator behind a magnet for a long time past a year and I went to use them specifically for the emergency trip I would need to visit my mother who is in stage 4 Cancer and my family has informed me that I need to come now, last minute. Knowing from previous experience that the cost of airfare is ridiculously absurd if not purchased within the 14 advanced day period/window that my flight would be expensive. I saved the vouchers to use for this occasion as indicated previously and they denied them saying they have expired. Wiith health concerns of my own and work on hold, I haven't been able to come up with the funds currently/last minute to pay for my flight home to see my dying mother. I've flown with Southwest Airlines since the early 70s when they operated out of Dallas Texas in there startup years. SW was my favorite/number one airline of choice, up until this point. I called customer relations four times, I left emails to corporate as instructed to and never received a response. It's been four weeks. I called again yesterday spoke with two independent reps neither would honor my voucher and book detremental flight. Bear in mine this! These provided vouchers were obtained during the onset of our Global pandemic, Coronavirus. I and the majority of Earthings refused to fly on a plane with uncertain contagious concerns of spreading the virus. If your one of those who believe its completely safe ans cannot catch the Coronavirus or any other illness aboard an enclosed, continuous air circulation cabin area and believe that, I pity you! Nobody at that time was flying in the air on aircraft. I certainly wasn't going to spend my vouchers on a planned flight. I saved them for emergency purposes only, such as this one and solely for this purpose. It's for the sake of using them because they canceled their flight and gave me vouchers instead of my money back leaving us stranded in Connecticut with no service. I have reached out to an attorney that I'm suing in general sessions court for $25000 The maximum allotted in General Sessions. Here's one of my confirmation numbers for any of you who work for Southwest and would like to investigate further, pre-prepare for our case. SW Legal department doesnt reply or answer calls either. Don't call. You will receive no further communication from me. Here's are two out of three confirmation numbers to initiate your burden. 4GPXX0 here's a bonus for you... 4YBAEN - SHAME ON YOU SOUTHWEST AIRLINES!"
Southwest Airlines,POOPED ON! LITERALLY!!!,1,"POOPED ON!!!! Literally! SOUTHWEST Flight number #3332 from Las Vegas to Maui on August 31, 2023. By a fellow passenger and Southwest refuses to pay for our damaged personal items. I am reaching out through social media and the Internet to let people know about the situation. After many phone calls to Southwest corporate offices, they are still refusing to pay for the items that we’ve had to throw away. It all started when at the very beginning of our flight, we noticed a very bad smell coming from the woman in front of us. We thought that she was just having bad gas, but it smelled so bad the entire flight! When it was time to start getting ready to land, I reached under to get my belongings under her seat, and when I pulled them out and onto my lap, noticed that there was poop all over my things which by then had also got onto my arms and legs! I immediately got up and went to the front of the plane to speak with a steward and stewardess. They were shocked at what had happened and were so nice. In fact, the steward got into his own personal duffel bag, and gave me clothes to change into. I had to change in the front of the plane behind the steward, stewardess and my husband. Then quickly sit back down in another seat before we landed. After landing, we had to wait around for a very long time. We had to stand around the gate to talk to airport police and EMT. After a very long time EMT took her off the plane. She was completely soiled in her own feces, it was very sad. She had obviously just been released from the hospital because she had some kind of port in her hand and bandages. She had not gotten up once the entire flight, and had continued to soil her self through the whole flight, and we had to sit behind and smell it the whole flight, and then deal with it getting on myself and our things. We were told by a SOUTHWEST employee that they had to unbolt and throw away the seats in that row she was sitting in! I have reached out many times to Southwest trying to get them to replace the items that I had to throw away. However, over and over they refused to be responsible for my damaged items. I tried to reason that since they threw their seats away and replaced them, then they should do the same for my things, but they refused. We have also had to get hepatitis testing due to the fact that her feces got onto my skin and I would like them to pay for that testing as well. Southwest says that they are not responsible for our damaged items. However, they are responsible for the actions of their passengers! Since Southwest will not contact me further regarding the situation, I feel the only thing left to do is to reach out to the Internet and social media, and let everyone know of this terrible situation.

Southwest Airlines,The opposite of customer service.,1,"Sorry we have been ""inconvenienced by a flight delay?"" REALLY?!! My daughter and 3 friends boarded a flight to depart at 8:00am. As of 11:53am they had not left yet. In the beginning the crew offered $600 to people who could leave the flight. 13 did and then another 9 did. My daughter and her friends have a connecting flight so they stayed on. As of 12:30pm they have not left. They have been offered water once and no snacks which is NOT what your Contingency Plan states at all. One of the bathrooms has had fecal matter scattered everywhere, by another passenger, including the walls and mirror. ""US airlines must provide passengers on domestic and international flights with food and water no later than 2 hours after a tarmac delay begins. The airline is required to keep the lavatories operable...."" At 12:40pm they were told by the flight crew that they could get off the plane for food. At 12:41 the man who checked their Boarding Passes said no they can't get off because they are about to leave. They have been detained 5 1/2 hours so far and yet the rules state ""After a tarmac delay of 3 hours in the U.S. or four outside of the U.S., passengers must be given the option to deplane."" I am furious these young ladies are experiencing this. At 12:30 I called 800-435-9792 and spoke to Tranail in ""Customer Service"". He said he couldn't help me but that I should make a complaint so here I am. I called back to ask for a Supervisor or Manager and was told by Robert that there is no one of any higher level I could speak as they are all out of Dallas. They only accept emails. He will try to help me and I have been on hold 19 minutes while tries to reach someone to help me. WHAT IN THE WORLD KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS?!!! Zero is what it is. THIS IS HORRIBLE! You have in essence kidnapped these passengers and you owe them compensation for the despicable treatment of paying customers. Lisa finally picked up my call at 1:11pm. I asked if she was a supervisor and she said no, she's the same as Robert. There's nothing she can do. The captain is in charge and then the flight crew. How do I reach someone higher? She leads me back to the SW website and the ""Contact Us"" link at the bottom. Who is going to answer for this shameful behavior?!!"
Southwest Airlines,Shame on you Southwest Airlines!,1,"What is going on with SW?? On a return flight from Puerto Rico to Denver, Southwest canceled the second leg of our flight out of Tampa, while we're IN THE AIR to Tampa, citing ""weather"". After doing much research and having our local news look into this, it appears that only the SW flights were canceled into Denver, other airlines were arriving as scheduled. The actual statistic for that evening were 47% of SW flights were cancelled into Denver and less than 5% ALL OTHER AIRLINES were cancelled. The FAA did not issue any closures or delays to Denver. I can't imagine why weather would be an excuse when no one else was using it. After talking to the agents, we kept being told that there were no other flights that evening, when in reality, there were... TO DENVER! We just weren't offered those flights. And yes, there was availability according to the website. And..they weren't canceled!

We received some of the most unapologetic, uncaring, and disingenuous treatment from Southwest Airlines across the board. From the gate agent to the ticketing agent to the baggage agent to the customer service rep. After leaving the airport (because our flight was changed to a 5AM flight the following day), I called to inquire again if there were better flights, I had to wait ONE to TWO hours just to speak to a live person. Our options to return were an early morning flight or an evening flight for a non-stop flight. There was no way I was going to chance taking a flight with a layover anywhere, Southwest is not to be trusted and I didn’t want to get into a situation where we were then stranded at yet another airport.

I don’t know what is going on with Southwest and why their business model is falling apart. SW used to be my “go-to” airline (we even had the credit card but have since retired it due to the airline’s inconsistency with flights). If you read social media and travel sites, their complaint meter has increased substantially. If SW thinks it's ok to strand passengers in random places just to make their “customary playbook” profitable, then they are not focusing on what is important. They might be forcing people to miss weddings, funerals, births, deaths. This is not OKAY. Why would anyone fly them?

The local news received a disingenuous reply from a SW rep regarding our situation but also showed some telling facts: ""Many of the flights we proactively canceled at the start of today were in anticipation of operational conditions in Denver...""

Southwest cancelled our flight IN THE MORNING and we were not notified until we were in the air on our way to Tampa. If we had been notified we would have chosen to stay (at our own expense) in San Juan to spend more time with our family, but we were not given that option. Other airlines always lets us know when a flight is going to be delayed or cancelled and they do this in advance and they let us change our flight to a time that works for us. SW does not offer this. Their system is antiquated and not user-friendly. We are disgusted with the treatment we received. They are losing loyal customers left and right. Why do they keep treating your passengers this way?

Shame on you Southwest!"
Southwest Airlines,Rude staff,1,"Rude staff, constant flight/ gate changes. Terribly run company"
Southwest Airlines,Worst Airline,1,"On 3/19/2024, I encountered an unexpected issue while attempting to check in for a Southwest flight at the airport. Despite having booked my flight a month in advance on 02/12/2024 for a family funeral trip scheduled from 03/19 to 3/25, I was informed by a Southwest agent that I needed a consent form from my sisters to travel with my minor niece and nephew. This requirement was unfamiliar to me, as I had previously traveled with the minors on Southwest Airlines without encountering this request.
The interaction with the agent and their supervisor was disheartening, as they exhibited rudeness and disrespect towards me. Despite my explanations and requests, they did not show a willingness to review my travel history with the minors or consider the circumstances of my family's bereavement. Additionally, I was given conflicting information about the acceptance of a notarized letter from the minors' guardian, causing further confusion and inconvenience.
I respectfully request a review of this incident, as it has caused distress during an already challenging time. I hope that this feedback can contribute to improvements in customer service and clarity of travel requirements for passengers, particularly in sensitive situations such as family emergencies.
I had a difficult experience with Southwest Airlines, as I was unable to board the flight and encountered unhelpful customer service. Despite this, I received a refund. I then booked with American Airlines and had a positive experience. I will be choosing American Airlines for future travel."
Southwest Airlines,Southwest doesn't value their customers like I thought they did,1,"To summarize:
- A delay turned into a cancellation that should have just been a cancellation from the beginning.
- Houston Southwest Hub is TERRIBLE!! (Even though their customer service was trying, the Southwest policies were just making it impossible to really help)
- My LUGGAGE was SOPPING WET including everything that was inside of it! (thank God I was going to visit family and not going somewhere else but that was not the case for other people)
-All in all, this was the worst experience with Southwest that I've ever had and for them to only give us a useless Hotel voucher for the evening was just Disrespectful and showed me they really don't care about their customers. Let me explain why.

We traveled from Belize to St. Louis but had a layover in Houston. I normally never have any issues with Southwest; they're my go-to, but after this flight, I can NEVER travel through Houston and won't always look to Southwest as my number one.

Our layover from Belize was four hours and the flight was a red-eye so we got food and relaxed for a little while we waited. As we got closer to boarding, a storm rolled through and diverted the plane to New Orleans. Not a problem at all since I hate flying when it's just cloudy. Once the storm cleared, the ticketing counter kept us updated on the re-boarding in New Orleans, the wheels being up, and them being halfway through the trip.

My issue came when the flight, about 20 minutes to landing in Houston to take us back to St. Louis was suddenly canceled. At this point, it's 1 am and everyone is confused and outraged because the sky is clear. We then find out, the flight crew ran out of flying hours. Seriously!? So, throughout this entire ordeal, which took about 3- 4 hours after the initial boarding time, NO ONE calculated their flight hours until they were getting ready to land?!

The icing on the cake was the rebooked flights for layover trips through Dallas to St. Louis the next morning and the hotel voucher that was basically useless! I mean seriously, it's 2 am by this time and we have to be on a flight in literally 4 hours?! In what world does leaving the airport and going to the hotel make any type of sense?

We were put on a standby list for the flight that was direct to St. Louis at 5:35 am that morning and because we were in the middle of a connection, we were told we were top priority and pushed above the others who weren't in the middle of a connection. Well, that was also FALSE! If someone had A+ preferred, we were pushed down the list after them even though they weren't in the middle of a connection.

The worst part is that after the horrible experience was over and we were finally in St. Louis to collect our bags, EVERYTHING WAS SOAKING WET! Essentially, it seems like during the storm, our bags were left outside unprotected and soaked by the rain. Why in the world would they leave them exposed like that? Everything smelled like mildew and was still wet, so I had to wash the entire contents of our bag and lay the electronics out to dry. Thankfully we had our laptops, but our firestick, chargers, and other things were in there. That alone really pissed me off. I just wanted to shower and change clothes and rest after 24+ hours of DOMESTIC travel that should have only been 12. But no, I had to do Laundry before I did anything else because I had nothing to change into!"

Southwest Airlines,URGENT COMPLAINT,1,"URGENT COMPLAINT - confirmation number 27CYS7 - RR# 20713247251

I am extremely disappointed that we drove to the Tampa International airport on 6/25/2023, waited for an hour to be told that our flight had been cancelled to DCA. The original customer service rep made an announcement and lied that the flight that we were moved to was a direct flight to DCA. It was not direct it was a layover overnight in Chicago. It was on my app where I was able to determine that she falt out lied over the intercom and to my husband, the flight was not direct, it was a layover in Chicago that was 2 days later, leaving Tampa International Airport on 6/27/2023. That change would caused us to be overnight for two more days in Tampa, and then I was told there were no hotel accommodations that Southwest could provide. We even asked Norma if we could contact Corporate and she said there was nothing that any of them could do about it. We have two small children, one that has Asthma and we would have had to stay in the airport overnight for 2 days since we they were not going to give us hotel accommodations for the inconvenience. After requesting that we be put on a flight that left on 6/25 as we originally planned, Norma put us on a flight to Baltimore and that is an hour and a half away from our home. Then we had to have our 75 year old father come an hour away at a later time, to pick us up. We get to Baltimore and had to wait for a gate to be opened, and waited for over 30 minutes before even being able to get off the plane. We only fly Southwest, this is very disappointing. We should have been given a hotel stay, and we should have been told earlier about the flight cancellation. We landed around 10:10pm left BWI 3 hours of looking for our luggage. I even called the 1800 number for customer service to see if they could help and was told that all they could tell me was that our bags were there. I asked if I could file a claim and was told that I had to work with the customer service there at the Southwest desk. The representatives for SouthWest at BWI were rude, there was only one person that was helpful and that was LaKeisha Anderson. She was the only person that wasn’t rude and the only person who helped and showed true customers service. The other customer service reps either didn't have their badges on or had badges without names. I would like to be reimbursed for all 4 of my return tickets and for this inconvenience. I can not believe this!
Martha from Southwest customer service called me on 6/26 and was only able to offer a $250 credit per person for all 4 of us traveling, and thought that was enough compensation for Southwest gate assistance lying about the fly change,the automated system putting us on a flight that would leave 2 days later and was through Chicago to get to DCA, and then not offering us a hotel and transportation for those two day. Norma the flight attendant at the gate for Southwest telling us that Southwest doesn’t do hotel vouchers and she didn’t know were we would stay. To Norma transferring us to fly to Baltimore and then us dealing with rude and disrespectful Southwest employees, taking off badges so we couldn’t report them, then spending 3 hours in the airport looking for luggage. We landed at 10:15 and didn’t get any of our luggage until 1:19am. Shae worked to find two of them. At 1:27 LaKeisha ended up funding and bringing us our last luggage and was the only one helpful out the the entire staff. Shae helped looked for luggage but threatened customers. And all Southwest can offer for this experience is $250 per person. We should have a full refund at a min! Each one of those employees at BWI for Southwest that worked last night needs be terminated how they acted, except for LaKeisha. It’s ridiculous that she was the only respectful one. This needs to be escalated and we deserve more than the $250 per person that you all are trying to offer! We also deserve to know that you are doing something about the staff at the BWI airport!"

Southwest Airlines,SW service has become very poor,1,"Very disappointed and dissatisfied as a customer with SW (waiting for customer service for almost an hour no answer)
Flight 2TZEE4 Orlando to Austin canceled my family traveling from PR stucked in airport with no options because you have no pilot to complete this trip in the middle of the holidays. The service has become very poor. Chat, phone calls and most important -flights. There is no money back that will fix the problem. No idea why you guys offer money back, or to buy with another airlines when for these days every flight is full and booked. I am so dissatisfied that words will never expressed the magnitude of my disappointment"
Southwest Airlines,I wish I could give them 0 stars,1,"I wish I could give them 0 stars, worst customer service I’ve ever had. Been on hold for over 5 hours and counting. They cancelled our fist flight, then rebooked us and took away the early boarding we paid for, then cancelled our second flight 5 minutes before we were supposed to take off. The customer service was so bad and so rude, they told us we had to call because they had too many people in line. Again, we’ve been on hold for 5 hours and counting, still haven’t been able to talk with anyone, been cut off several times. We spent over $900 on these tickets and cannot get any service. So disappointed, this was my first time attempting a flight with southwest and I will certainly never fly with them or try to again. This is absolutely ridiculous."

Southwest Airlines,Southwest sucks,1,"Southwest cancelled my flight and took it upon themselves to rebook me for another flight scheduled for 3 days later. When I called to request a refund not only was I on hold for almost two hours, I was told that I could only get flight credit. Why should I only get flight credit when I paid for a flight to depart on December 23 and was not given one. Southwest stole my money! I paid for something that was not provided I should be entitled to a full refund given that I did not get what I paid for. What’s to stop Southwest from canceling every one’s flight every day and forcing them to get a credit. I don’t want a credit. I don’t want to ever fly Southwest again. I don’t need a credit. I need my money back since Southwest couldn’t deliver what I paid for. Southwest can’t keep my money. That is stealing!"
Southwest Airlines,Would like to commend Charlie on flight…,5,Would like to commend Charlie on flight 1399 from Love Field to BWI on 12/19. My wife is in a wheelchair and Charlie went above with the care he took care with my wife on boarding and on exiting the aircraft.
Southwest Airlines,Southwest needs more staff,4,Southwest needs more staff to help people with disabilities. I was traveling from Oklahoma to Arizona. And there was only one person on the plane working that could help us. His name was Shawn. If it wasn't for him we wouldn't have made it up the 2 new uphill high ramps and to baggage claim. He was a god sent. He was also help another woman that had dementia and pushing her as well. So he had to push two wheelchairs at the same time with no help. Southwest needs to hire more people as soon as possible or make it so the families can come and assist their family getting off the plane. I was on Fight 1471/ Gate B on Dec 12 the 2022.
Southwest Airlines,Cranky Flight Attendant,1,"On a long flight from MSP to Denver on Nov 21st, I asked the older, heavy set FA (Lindsey/Leslie?) for 2 beers. She got rude saying ""I will get you one and see how you do"" in front of my 25 y/o son. I was stunned. Then she condescended: ""Do you have a problem with that?"" I didn't answer because I thought she was baiting me into an argument. When we landed, I told the Pilot (Sean) about it. He agreed she was being rude and said he would talk to her."
Southwest Airlines,Horrible customer service...Greedy Airline,1,"I bought three tickets for myself and two others. The system put one person’s ticket on another flight. This person has never flown before. I explained this to Southwest customer service, and they wouldn’t waive the change fee. I then sent an email to Executive Office, and I am still waiting for a response. This airline has terrible customer service, and I will never fly them again. The charged me $160 to change a $168 ticket. I WILL TAKE ANY OTHER AIRLINE BUT SOUTHWEST!!!"
Southwest Airlines,Two nights ago I paid $1200.00 for a…,1,"Two nights ago I paid $1200.00 for a round trip ticket to Atlanta for 11/22/22 returning to Seattle 11/29/22. I arrived in Denver 12:30 pm with a connection to Atlanta at 5pm. I have paid for a rental car and hotel. Unbeknownst to me the flight was changed from gate C 61 to gate C 47 10 minutes after the boarding was to take place, I inquired and was told that the flight changed to C 47 which was a 3-4 minute walk and that they would phone ahead to let them know that I was on the way. When I arrived I was told that the flight had departed. That the only thing available was at 5:00am. I asked for a complimentary room, I was denied. I called customer service and was told that I would receive a call in 16 minutes. That call back came in 33 minutes and I had to wait on hold another 12 minutes before a live person came on the phone. All she could do was say I am sorry. My wife and I have been loyal Southwest Customers over 20 years. A few years ago Southwest bumped me for a lady with a dog at least that time they provided a room for overnight convenience. While writing this review I was told that someone canceled on Flight 1679 to Atlanta. Told him that I would take it. Hopefully I can retrieve my luggage. They more than likely bumped someone else it strange that I got a Business Select seat A-10"
Southwest Airlines,Wouldn't honor the companion pass promotion,1,"I bought a RT ticket, flew in time and emailed them that their website was down and wouldn't let me officially register for the 3 month companion promo - figuring customer service would honor it after I made sure I purchased everything on time. They did not, told me it was basically my fault for their website not allowing for sign up."
Southwest Airlines,I was considering switching to Delta…,5,"I was considering switching to Delta Airlines. Then I jumped on a Southwest Flight with my husband for our honeymoon. The flight attendants were so kind and personally congratulated us. They then proceeded to announce congratulations on the overhead speakers. The whole plane clapped. No other airline has this type of personal touch. Thank you, Southwest."
Southwest Airlines,Absolutely the only way to fly...,5,"Absolutely the only way to fly...

Booked a flight to Ft Lauderdale from Austin a couple of weeks ago. Had trouble getting a rental car so so I thought I should reschedule the flight. Called customer service less than 24 hours before my flight to change it. I was able to make the change with no extra charges or fees. $167 rt

When I got on the plane there were two women seated in the 1st row so I sat in the middle seat. First time in my life that I was the first passenger off a plane.

Why would anyone fly with any other airline? Free checked bags, great friendly customer service, no charge for changes, credits and points no longer expire.

Southwest you raise the bar for air travel!"
Southwest Airlines,Unfair Seating,2,"Hello. Southwest Airlines doesn't have assigned seats. You check in. And based on how early you check in; or if you have other perks; you're on the plane sooner than others. So why do the flight attendants hold rows of seats by literally putting their knees on the seats blocking access to sit? If I'm in B; I shouldn't have to sit in the back of the plane (if I don't want to; or if other seats are available closer), because you want someone in C who checked in later to sit closer. Date of experience was September 30 2022."
Southwest Airlines,I have 2 different flights this month,1,"I have 2 different flights this month. My daughter lost her ID and couldn't get on the flight so I booked her a hotel room. The attendant told me she just didn't want to fly and charged me for the difference. I booked my other flight 4 months in advanced, and need to come back a day earlier. The attendant wants to charge me 185.00 to change my flight from a Tues to a Wed. No bargain with these charges."
Southwest Airlines,didn’t give me full credit even though I am the one that purchased tickets,1,"So they have this rule that if you purchase a ticket for a companion the name can’t be changed. This is such a stupid rule. If I payed with MY money, I should be able to have all form of credit under my name.
Will never use this company again! I’ve been using delta for years and they are definitely the number 1 company. No stupid rules!"
Southwest Airlines,Watch out when booking on Southwest Airlines,1,"We attempted to book a flight from BWI to Indianapolis for Sunday, October 16, 2022 and wanted to use miles. We were in the process of putting in the information to purchase the ticket and got a notice that we needed to purchase additional miles. We purchased $345 in additional miles to have enough for the ticket and then continued to enter the rest of our information for the ticket. When we clicked purchase, we got an error message and it said to call the airline. Upon speaking with a Southwest Airlines representative, we were told that the flight was now sold out. So frustrating. We then asked for our money back for the miles we could no longer use and were told that they were non-refundable. Apparently Southwest thinks it's ok to spend $345 and not even get a ticket for it. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, I was told that they would forward my ""case"" to Corporate Customer Relations and that we'd hear from them in 10-12 business days. We just received a call from a Customer Relations representative and all he did was explain that he wouldn't refund the money and that it was their policy. The entire process is a bait and switch and should be banned. Southwest Airlines should stop these fraudulent practices and refund customer's money when they can't give them a ticket. We plan to avoid Southwest Airlines whenever we can. Watch out."
Southwest Airlines,I just got back from a flight/hotel with Southwest,1,"I just got back from a flight/hotel with Southwest to Vegas. I was going with my daughter who is from Austin. I flew from Love Field in Dallas to Austin. Then met her and we flew on to Vegas. The flight was OK but we had to sit across from each other and barely talked because of the noise. But when we got to Vegas we stayed at the MGM Grand bc we had stayed there many years ago and my daughter wanted to stay in the same hotel we had stayed in before. This time MGM was just awful..The carpet was filthy, the bathtub stopped up or toliet stopped up as well. My son had met us there and flew American. They both got mad and left me in Vegas all alone. The reason I even tell you this is because I thought I had lost my phone and was desperate in Vegas. So it was late at night and they left, I went to a security guy to see if he could help me and he flat said no. I was shocked. How unfriendly can anyone be even when a 71 year old woman is in deep trouble and he does nothing to help in any way. It was so sad and so shocking. Finally a nice lady in line waiting to speak to the front desk clerk let me call my husband. I still cannot believe how bad it was. But then when I went to check out I found out that when you book a travel package with SW there is always an additional $40 per night that you are charged for nothing I mean nothing. They call it Resort Fees!!! No it was more like robbery fees. They just robbed me of $120 for a filthy room that cost me for a package deal of $2359.00 plus the $40 a night for resort fees. A bunch of crap. I went to Oklahoma and got a brand new rood free for two nights that were just wonderful. That was what made us want to go to Vegas. My husband and I used to go to Vegas at least 3 times a year and stay in many hotels and he said they were always nice and never had heard of Resort Fees. Never again will I ever step foot in any resort that MGM Grand owns. Worst experience."
Southwest Airlines,"They cancel our flight, they gave us another flight, and later they told us that they do not have sits any more. Southest have playing with our time all day. Our next flight is going to be at 8:50 pm",1,"They canceled our flight this morning. They gave us 3 more flighs but at the end all of them were full, didn't have any sits for us. Now they gave us another (flight) at 8:50 pm. Let's pray that southwest don't cancel again.
They play with the customers' time.
I hope never book with this company any more."
Southwest Airlines,Simultaneously checked in with my 12…,1,Simultaneously checked in with my 12 year and so daughter who is assigned end of C and myself end of A. The next message asks me to pay money to upgrade her. Talked to three southwest employees who would not let her board with me. We were separated in the Dallas airport causing a lot of stress. Will be changing airlines.
