Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,Ariline Expert,"30 March,",,"The BEST! Ohhhhhh YES! The BEST among the few BEST; EVER! ?EXCEPTIONAL! 'A' Grade across the board. âœ…
Thank you Singapore Airlines for excellence!?"
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"06 July,",,"Still the best of the best. Great food, in-flight entertainment, cabin crew and comfort."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"16 January,",,Good!
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"05 July,",,"Travelled London to Singapore on a 380. SIA have a very different view of PE to other airlines. Note their use of 'privilege' and 'priority' in their advertising. PE is simply the front of economy with a flimsy partition between them. They offer a good seat with good features including an exceptional screen and headphones.  Drinks and all other service is with economy; its just you get served first. I have noticed a distinct deterioration in SIA food over the last decade or so, and this flight was no exception. A privilege is to book a special meal. Good idea because the in-flight offerings were not much. However, while plentiful the food was bland and not that well prepared. Wine was served in the smallest glasses I have ever seen on any airline. It was a tasting at best. Further, there was no choice - other than red or white - and the quality was modest. For some reason, the coffee/tea cups were also small. SIA charge plenty for PE, but did not deliver that much. Overall, based on this trip I think Cathay and BA are better value for money and Qantas offers a far better service for about the same cost.  I might take SIA again, but only if I could find no other option."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"14 April,",,"Bed was reasonably comfortable. Food was awful. Mocha/coffee was dreadful. Cabin crew were attentive. Pilots were great, very vocal and could be easily understood. Flight was mostly smooth and comfortable. Bathroom was kept clean. Pleasant flight but food needs an improvement. "
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,,"12 February,",,"We really love travelling on Singapore Airlines . The staff were excellent , especially Helena, Cai, Philip and Manhas. They were so helpful and friendly. The food was delicious and the drinks great. The seats were comfortable and roomy for economy. Singapore airport is one of our favorite airports in the world, love the orchids and the butterfly enclosure, a very beautiful airport."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"12 August,",,Perth to Tokyo and Osaka to Perth via Singapore.  Had not flown Singapore Airlines for many years and was very impressed.  Nice touch to have a choice of Japanese Meal from Osaka to Singapore.
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"14 September,",,I wasnt expecting this from an airline with whom i travelled the most. Flew premium economy class and to my surpirise wasnt even close to what they advertised. Seriously not happy would never recommend
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"06 October,",,"Perth Singapore London return. A passenger was using an IPad while aircraft was taxiing so I alerted a cabin staff member who told me it was no longer required not to use electronic equipment during take off and Landing. I pointed out that the fasten seatbelt sign also alerted passengers not to use such equipment. I also took a look at the Safety Information card which also stated the equipment should not be used. I also noted that during the serving of meals the cabin staff did not request that seats be returned to their upright position to enable the passenger behind to be able to comfortably eat their meal. The entertainment system was stop go indicating that the server could not deliver the video without stopping to catch up constantly. The pillow provided had a nasty stain on it and finally, the underside of the toilet seat was covered in long term grime, very unpleasant. Look forward to your response.

EDITORS COMMENT:  Electronic devices can be used in flight mode on many aircraft now. The rules for this will vary between airlines and indeed aircraft but definitely it is ok on Singapore Airlines - provided it is in flight mode.  It is nice when the cabin crew ask passengers to put their seats up at meal times and generally the airline do do that. The airline needs to upgrade the entertainment on some older aircraft definitely and as for the toilet  - you can't really control what other passengers have left behind on a long haul flight. "
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"02 March,",,"Travelled on a round trip  from Singapore to LA  From take off to touch down,  experience was generally good. However,  am impress with the efficient service I received from  FA Judy, During my return flight  on  SQ 11 from LA to Sin on 20/2 /17, I was supposed to receive products bought at DFS, LAX at the boading gate but  for some reason  the same never reach me as promised. I seek assistance from the crew,  and was attended by Ms Judy who was so professional and helpful  assuring me that she had sent an email to DFS to find a solution to my problem. Judy was so efficient and helpful throughout the handling of the case and  was able ot provide a personal touch and exude warmth and understanding as well as  communicating updates regularly to me until the aircraft made a layover at Narita,Tokyo. At Narita, I was approached by the ground staff  Yuri who continue to update me with the latest status and she too exercise  patient and responsive to my request.
Kudos Singapore Airline, for having a great team who are committed to excellent customer service and one that makes customer feel respected and valued. Judy and Yuri""s dedication to a client's problem is commendable."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"15 March,",,"Flew Sydney - Singapore- Paris in premium economy. Great seats, extra space very comfortable, food choices great & service as usual, tops. Have now flown with SIA over 15 times and always experienced top quality service & attention . This was our first Premium Economy flights & they were well worth the additional cost, Our return flight in January resulted in an upgrade to Business class for the Singapore -Sydney sector....wow....now we are spoilt ....planning another trip for December 2017...what do we do now !!!"
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"07 October,",,"Fucking singapore airlines doesnt care about passengers duty free products,  they always delay in timings, no good service, rude behaviour with passengers i wish nobody should prefer this airlines."
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"30 March,",,"Singapore to Hongkong, First week of March.!
The flight was neat and tidy, quite big. Inflight entertainment was good. I don't have enough choices with Breakfast but good though. The Cabin crew must have good training on how to treat passengers, showing an unhappy face all the time that attending flights is the only duty and not serving for passengers. You can feel comfort during travel except the unhappy airhostess!!"
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,Trace Kan,"11 October,",,"Flew PER-SIN 18/9 and SIN-PER 25/9. Both flights were great with attentive crew. PER-SIN was on a new A350.  Having been the last few trips on Scoot and Jetstar, it was nice to enjoy a full service airline. Lunch consisted of beef rendang with a delicious Maggie Beer ice cream for dessert. IFE system takes a little bit effort to get full use of it.  Sometimes it only offered limited options for music and TV depending on your previous choice.  SIN - PER was on Boeing 787.  We took advantage of early checkin at Jewel Changi so we could have time to explore Jewel. Captain was awesome with giving updates during the flight.  Even though both flights had great crews, I felt on this flight, crew were just a bit more efficient.  Meal was a very delicious chicken in oyster sauce with a Singaporean local brand ice-cream for dessert. I had looked forward to watching part 2 to a series on the IFE that I had watched on my flight the week before but unfortunately could not find on this plane so maybe the IFE varies slightly on different planes."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,,"02 January,",,"Having flown with Singapore Airlines over the years and really enjoying their service, our last flight with them was rather disappointing as well as frustrating. Their meals were very average. I had the fish on the return flight and left half of it. My wife was the first to use the toilet and she said it smelt when she went in. Toilet floors were wet with, presumably urine, throughout the flight. They seem to have cut back on the number of flight stewards used to service passengers and the cabin to what they once had. Because our connecting flight was delayed by over an hour, we almost missed our flight for the home leg. Though delays happen of course, there was a lack of communication to passengers about what was happening. Due to the delayed flight our baggage didnâ€™t arrive with our flight. Again, these things happen, but SIâ€™s ground support contractors did not have a record of one of our pieces of luggage. It was a nightmare trying to communicate with the baggage contractors to find out what had happened to our missing luggage."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"23 January,",,Singapore-Yangon-Singapore
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,"Recently travelled Perth/Singapore/Paris and then London/Singapore/Perth. The 777s were looking a bit tired but the 380 was good. In the 777 I sat in the aisle seat (centre row) which had reduced foot space so watch out for that one. The entertainment system has a reasonable choice of things to watch but you can't see them all from the beginning. This needs upgrading. Service was very good. The vegetarian meals were average and the non-vege food wasn't much better. All up though, they were okay but will probably try another airline next time."
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"24 December,",,Overall a good airline but whoever decided that touch screens were a good idea was not thinking straight that day. Who on earth would you put a device on the back of a head rest that is tapped and pressed to operate!! I traveled from Melbourne to London with the back of my head receiving a sporadic tapping from the passenger behind. If you want to feel what it's like just get the person sitting next to you as you are reading this to rest their iphone against the back of your head while they write a text message. Now imagine that for hours on end. That's what it is line in these daft seats.
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,Will Ramanto,"23 May,",,"The Good:
- Flight crew is always friendly, helpful and always seeks to cater to your needs
- Food on the flight is great (though I've noticed Book the Cook options to be limited)

The Bad:
- The SQ JFK check-in process (even for business class) is one of the most chaotic and frustrating experiences I've had. It can take up to 30 minutes being in line (for a Business class passenger) &amp; I've encountered a check-in staff who raised their voice to customers. I even witnessed one of the supervisors rolling their eyes and being snarky at a Business class-Solitaire customer (SQ's highest status) who insisted on lining up in the First Class line (which the SQ website says they are allowed to do so). 

Additional: 
- I've been having issues with missing miles on Singapore's Krisflyer and my interaction with SQ customer service has been a nightmare. It's been 6 months now since I've had the issue, and 4 months since I've flagged the issue to Singapore Airlines customer service, and it has yet to be resolved. It's a shame to see what used to be a great airline fall from grace this quickly and this badly."
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,,"25 May,",,"We flew FRA -&gt; SIN -&gt; CEB. First leg was Singapore, 2nd was Scoot. Both items of luggage got lost in SIN It took them two and four days to make the luggage available at the destination airport, where I had to pick it up myself. Singapore Airways refers me to Scoot to bargain for a compensation which ""we decide on a case by case basis after you prove your expenses"". Back in Germany I call their hotline (+49 69 7195-200), but it's busy like ""all our agents are busy, call again later"". We flew economy in an A380, seats were older than that plane exists. On board entertainment was ancient."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"14 May,",,"I'm a frequent flyer. My first time with Singapore airline shocked me. The rudeness of their service is appalling. To start with, maybe a smile will help but instead of being friendly this steward insist of being offensive, I can understand he's being treated badly by a couple of Japanese in front of me. It may just be a language barrier. So this jerk choose to deal with this experience by being rude  to everyone in the vicinity. I wish I got his name. He should be fired!"
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"22 August,",,"Basically, even though a decent airline, the economy coach baggage allowance of 23kg per luggage piece is simply unreasonably low for international travel. A minimum of 32kg is standard, and the least amount a traveler should be forced to comply with. Had I known Singapore Airlines had such a useless baggage policy, I would have booked my fare on another airline. The kg overages for zone 3 travel are 16$USD PER KILOGRAM. This is an exorbitant and unreasonable rate versus fuel costs. In future I will not be booking any travel on Singapore Airlines. That's not called customer service; it's called extortion."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"04 June,",,"2th time we flew with SQ to Bali. This time we flew from Dusseldorf. Smooth check in , smooth boarding.  Very good inflight service although one off the flight attendants seemed very stressed to me. She even  didn't make eye contact during inflight service when handing out food or drinks. Good inflight entertainmant system . Smooth touch  down in SGP. "
Singapore Airlines,0 / 10,ar,"14 June,",,"Terrible customer service

I travelled with a group of 35 high school students fro Australia to France. Due to a schedule change by Singapore Airline we missed our connection in Zurich, even though it had been a one-ticket fare. The worst was that Singapore Airlines offered very little help and absolutely no assistance  for what ended either as a 12 hour layover in Zurich or a forced airport change in Paris, from CDG to ORY. Under the ridiculous pretext of 'that it had not been part of our initial ticket' they refused to arrange a connection from Zurich via Geneva to our destination Nice.  And they refused to arrange or pay for  the coach I had to arrange between the two airports in Paris. Our experience with Singapore Airlines customer care was TERRIBLE. "
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"25 March,",,Overall fair service !
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"10 February,",,"Yesterday i flew from Perth to London, via Singapore, with Singapore Airlines. They are currently my favourite airlines to fly with.
The flight staff are amazing! They are genuinely happy and friendly. They seem to be continually offering you a service, but not obtrusively.
They think of things before you do. Like , offering you a drink, more food, collecting your rubbish, taking away your tray!   No sitting with an annoying tray blocking your exit from your seat or restricting your movement for hours!! They even remember what you drink!!!! They warned me that my food choice could be spicy, was i ok with that?
The long flight was enjoyable and I caught up on some great movies and slept well for an economy airline flight. Congratulations on a job well done and excellent pride in your work. 
Thank you."
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"07 October,",,"Singapore to Brisbane SQ176. I travelled with my 11 year old and 16 year old ( on a single booking number) and we were all seated in completely different rows. Our travel agent asked us to confirm the flight which was done in Vietnam by the hotel concierge the day before, and we went on a Silk Air Singapore Airlines flight the day before. They were aware of our ongoing arrangements as they asked if we wanted to put the bags through or not(we had a 1 night stop in Singapore). The check in counter lady in Singapore  was rude and said that the flight was full and it was bad luck and she could do nothing. On my insistence she relunctantly looked and put the children together in row 55 and me in row 46( different cabin). After going to the boarding gate I pleaded with them to see if anything could be done and they quickly were able to change a seat with a single traveller. My family was upset and my little boy was crying but the staff had no compunction to let a child who had the same booking number as his mother , fly an 8 hour international flight alone. 0/10 Singapore Airlines!!"
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"12 March,",,Good service and communication. Comfortable too!
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"26 June,",,Singapore airlines are terrific their quality of service is second to none. That great service starts right from the booking experience where we had to contact staff over an online booking recently. Helpful and polite always. We fly very frequently to the UK from Auckland and have done so since 1980 we have flown SIA many times during that period although I will say not exclusively. We have always come back to SIA because of the poor service on some of these other airlines. The age of SIA fleet is one of the youngest in the world and they are maintained in tip top condition. A big attraction too for kiwis is that they fly to Singapore direct from Auckland unlike some of their Gulf and Aussie competitors who have other stops that add to the journey time
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"14 December,",,"My husband flew business from melbourne to manila and found business to be less then fair..the food was poor , the seating old and shabby, comparef to garuda which we flew from Amerstedam to Jakarta  which was amazing food , service and comfortable. .Singapore  airlines needs to pick up its act ...would never recommended  spending  the money to fly business with them again..."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"09 January,",,"Living in Adelaide we don't have much choice, but have to say SQ's service is one of the better choices we can choose. Travelling on Dec 25 I didn't think it would be busy, but a full flight. Staff were professional and pleasant, service was excellent. Plane was an older A330 but clean and comfortable. IFE great and the food was professional plated and vast. You can't be hungry on a SQ flight from ADL. "
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"02 February,",,"Just recently flew Singapore Airlines from AKL-SIN-BOM and back. I fly frequently with SQ and i have to say their inflight service always is the best no matter what, however i was kind of disappointed with the A380 aircraft on my route from AKL-SIN. I do understand that the aircraft they use is about 8 years old now but their economy class seats are quite uncomfortable for a 10 hour flight. I wont complain about IFE systems they are ok, does not have touchscreen like its competitors Emirates, Korean, Thai etc. I much prefer their Boeing 777 aircraft economy as the seats are spaced out atleast. Apart from that i have no complaints for SQ, i only wish they upgrade their economy like how Emirates has now on most of their aircrafts to better seats and bigger screens."
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,,"05 November,",,"Having used Singapore Airlines extensively (Solitaire member) over the past few years I am quite disappointed with Singapore Airlines and find the over rated, expensive and little value for money. As I flew return to New York for the first time (I normally go east via Japan) this was a very poor experience, not only in the air but on the ground as well. In essence you are treated as a ""transaction"" on the ground and in the air. The food offered is very poor. I have given up on the chicken satay that is being served on every flight as starters as they are dried out, poor quality and when you add that the choices are quite messy as ""warmed up food"" normally is. My wife had given up on Singapore airlines and flew to London via Hanoi with Vietnam airlines and she said, twice the service at half the cost in Business class. I will try this route on my next time as they seem hungry to deliver service and at a reasonable price where I am not at all happy with Singapore Airlines although I have used them extensively in the past. From now on, I will spread my patronage with local airlines ( not SILK) as they seem very motivated to serve whereas Singapore Airlines seems arrogant and take your patronage for granted."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"09 May,",,"I used to be a loyal SQ frequent flyer. But not anymore. SQ really need to improve their service. Seriously, once in a while I take coach, and the service are terrible!!! First, a smile wouldn't hurt. If all of you somehow managed to hurt ur jaw and can't smile, at least do not look annoyed. I frequent travel in First or Business so-so service, somehow they managed to smile in these part of the plane. Travel with a child? Strongly suggest another airline. This one is not child friendly at all... 
Once I travel in coach with a broken seat (slightly reclined, around 2 cm). One of the crew asked me to change seat during take off and landing, ok no problem, for safety reason, Got that. BUT with attitude. She said to me, ""MAM, you can't seat here, you need to move with ur baby."" She moved me to business class and right after take off she said ""Mam, u need to move back now, this is business class area"". Seriously?!? Now I fly any other airlines, Garuda, Emirates, ANA, Korean Air, top notch service, good food as well. So SQ, hospitality 101 for your crew is urgently needed!!!"
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"22 December,",,"Very good airline to travel with, everything was done how you would expect from a premium carrier. Always depend on the same high standard of service its a credit to the airline."
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"11 December,",,"Terrible non existent customer service. I can't believe Changi does not even have a person from SQ direct to assist their passengers and the one person they had on duty could not do a thing. Needless to say it took 5 hours before we even speak with him.  He was a puppet with no discretionary authority to approve anything whatsoever.

Flight out of Guangzhou late due to late arrival of inbound from Singapore. Arrived Singapore with just enough time to transfer to gate with more than 15 mins before flight would have left but were told they would not let us on connecting flight. I didn't care about my baggage transfer made no difference.They changed us to flight 6 hrs later arriving  5.20am. Not good working at 8am with clients and patients. Need sleep, could not pay to upgrade to business to get some sleep short of $3500 one way per pax. What a joke. Preprared to pay reasonable but not $3500!

Add vouchers given had a wrong date next day, so couldn't be used!!!!

Service so bad, systems awful. One and only actual SQ staff in the whole of Changi airport, rest of staff outsourced to Changi airport. They had absolutely no authority at all. Complete disgrace.

Zero rating "
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"10 November,",,"Flew from Brisbane to London on 3 November 2015 with a four-hour layover at Changi airport. I have always found Singapore staff to be very efficient and functional rather than 'friendly' and this experience was no different. This is not necessarily a bad thing - frankly I prefer a 'direct' approach when getting from A to B. Nonetheless, the flight was comfy and the food and entertainment good for both legs (regionally Cathay Pacific for me have the edge with food). While Singapore can be expensive if you catch one of their quick-fire sales you can secure a great deal. 
EDITORS COMMENT: couldn't agree with you more  - you're exactly right!"
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"05 July,",,Very good experience I had during my journey from India to Australia. The attendants are really good and supportive. Traveling with a kid alone I find the crew more supporting and accomodating
Singapore Airlines,0 / 10,Josh Cairns,"26 July,",,"3 years agio this business class product used to be a quality one. Now it is absolutely awful. Aircraft is messy, old and dirty, but that's not even the headline of awful. It is the staff. From the minute you enter the lounge to the time you exit the flight, it is so unpleasant bordering on hostile. I have never experienced a worse business class airline experience in my life, and I can't even imagine how bad the economy class must be!!!"
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"13 December,",,"I have always traveled by Singapore airlines for all my international trips and never had a problem with them. The inflight experience, quality of food and beverages were of high standards. Would definitely recommend this airline to everyone, never had a problem with SIA. "
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"19 December,",,"On Friday evening, I flew from Singapore to Sydney. In the first hour I became very very sick with what I now know to be viral gastro. I was vomiting almost constantly for the first 3 hours of the flight, at which point I asked the staff for assistance. They offered me a charcoal pill, a woman who wasn't a doctor diagnosed me with food poisoning, and then proceeded to encourage me to drink water (which I couldn't keep down) and -wait for it!- hot strong black tea with sugar in it. A caffeinated sugary diuretic when I was already dehydrated. She even looked offended when I said no thank you. I then begged for a place to lie down (even the floor) as I was in agony sitting - they said simply sorry, flight's full, and offered no further assistance. Right before the end of the flight they took my temperature twice suggesting they may need to quarantine me and lastly offered me medical assistance for when we landed - which I declined as I'd rather see my own doctor thank you very much.  Any airline can do well when things are easy - this airline will not help you when you need it the most. RUBBISH service and dangerously negligent. Just wait til someone has it worse than I did and sues. 
EDITORS COMMENT: That must have been awful for you.  It sounds however   like they did what they could given it was a full flight.  No medication available over the counter can really help with vomiting and sweet tea is often used by Asian cultures to calm down an upset stomach. All they can really do is keep you warm and hydrated as best they can. It must have been an absolutely awful flight for you but there really isn't much they can do "
Singapore Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"05 February,",,"Very disappointed.  Paid for good seats, Singapore changed them.  They admit it was their mistake but all they can offer now is for me to change my flight or be separated from my daughter.     What is worse is they LIED to me in first instance as I was first told it was because I changed date (it has never changed), then told I had changed them myself (I hadn't).  Although they admit their mistake the only choice is for me to take a later flight."
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"14 October,",,"Not very impressed with Singapore Airlines. In the route Perth - Singapore - Perth they put old planes with outdated entertainment screen. Food was pretty average as well and on my return flight I ended up eating an oily deep fried fish as they ran out of the beef.

The person at the check-in was a bit rude and didn't know I could use my Star Alliance Gold status from other company on this flight. Took her 10 minutes to sort it out and she even told me she needed to check if the card was not fake!

As I'm a tall guy, I paid an extra $60 for the exit row with extra leg room but the seat was so worn out and it was very uncomfortable, so I spent 5 hours sit on something with no cushion. After complaining and being ignored by two different crew members, the third one at least tried to put a blanket over the seat, which didn't help too much. Complaint via website remains unanswered after two weeks.

Not many options on this route but I'd rather fly Qantas than Singapore Airlines.

EDITORS COMMENT: There are still a few outdated aircraft flying around but pretty soon you should see an improvement on this (we hope!)"
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"08 January,",,"Flew from SIN to Hanoi last month with SIA, and the service was definitely up to expectations. In-flight entertainment variety was plentiful, and the food tasted surprisingly good (for an airline meal). Take-off was delayed on both legs of the flight by 10 minutes, but I'm cool with that. Still managed to reach destination before the stipulated time.

Flight attendants were friendly and approachable. Top-notch service. Sometimes people have too strong a sense of self-entitlement that any requests not met satisfactorily is ""bad service"" without even thinking whether their requests are out of the line. Cheers to Singapore Airlines for such a pleasant and comfortable flight."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"13 October,",,"My first long haul experience and its was comfortable and with such great in flight entertainment the journey past quickly. The staff were so friendly and helpful would recommend this airline.

EDITORS COMMENT: They're one of our favourites for long haul economy travel too. "
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"21 November,",,"Houston to Moscow to Singapore to Manila - and return a month later;  Amazing Service in Economy that exceeds business class on some other airlines - start with steaming towels almost as soon as the seatbelt light goes out followed by juice, coffee, wines, even mixed drinks - snacks, exceptional meals of both asian and western cultures, and if they dont bring something soon enough you can walk back to the galley and request a wide variety of in between snacks including ""toberlone chocolates"" however during daytime flights they are going up and down the isles almost continuosly - 249 movies some less than a month or two since release, 500 other television shows - i binge watched whole seasons with  the first two legs of the trip each about 12 hours - Also 110 outlets and usb - oh, and i cant forget the courtesy zippered cloth bag with socks, toothbrush and toothpaste - i ended up with 4 of them in a round trip - super satisfied"
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"14 May,",,"Richard
Travelled on a Boeing 777 from Perth to Singapore and Singapore to Perth
Aircraft look a bit old sitting on runway, I like to see wing lets on the wing tips.
But once in side every thing look modern and neat, It is amazing what a refurbish can do.
Flight both ways was very comfortable and little turbulence both ways.
On arriving back in Perth, the landing was the best I have ever seen, This Captain knew how to fly a 777 and land one. Well done Captain 
Made a point of congratulating him and first office in the baggage hall on a pleasant flight.
To my surprise they both had time to listen and reply to my questions
And where eager to know why I was so interested in Aviation.                 Flying never leaves you after 35yrs . Just the sadness I not be-able to do it any-more."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"24 February,",,"Excellent service, food and inflight entertainment. 
Indeed lives up to its name of Singapore Airlines - a great way to fly!
Service crew were always smiling and willing to assist!"
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"12 May,",,"It was a fabulous flight. In one of them, we even got awesome touchscreen TVs! You could ask for any food if you wanted and if they had it, they would deliver. It was great. Just a bit more cleaniness and it would be perfect. We got to board early which was a suprise since it was a ecomony flight. We also got a mini amenity kit with super warm and cosy socks, tooth paste and toothbrush. Definitely fly again. We went from MEL to DEL "
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,Kevin Hays,"05 November,",,"I flew Perth to Singapore and then transferred to the Singapore to Newark in Business Class, great service, food and comfort."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"01 December,",,"Perth to Singapore and return on a A330. If flying to Singapore from Perth definitely try a book on this aircraft type. Seating layout is 2-4-2 and the seat widths are slight bigger than on 777s. While Qantas continues to use narrow body jets between Perth and Singapore, I'll stick with Singapore Airlines. You got to hand it to Singapore Airlines, time and time again they deliver a first class product.   "
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"17 January,",,"Flight:SQ221 (A380)
From Singapore to Sydney.
Check-in at Changi Airport was the worst. We travelled as a family of 5 (4 adults and a 3 years old). The woman who checked in our luggages was very unhappy, rude, uneducated and moody, tried to pick on us every little thing. She has no understanding of family travelling with small children. Shame on Singapore airline, we have been travelling with you for soon long and this would be the last, never again. On board, food was as bad, I did not have a choice, there were not enough for everyone to choose so I had to take what was left. Very poor services, worse than budget airlines. "
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,Lee kane,"24 November,",,"it appears that Singapore Airlines slogan ""Placing you at the heart of everything we do"", only applies when you are actually travelling, any customer service does not extend to dealing with complaints regarding delays quickly and efficiently. We were delayed 24 hours in September 2023, and we are still waiting for the airline to resolve and comply with UK civial aviation rules regarding compensation."
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"13 January,",,"Our airplane had a technical issue on the Moscow-Singapore (Airbus 350 SQ361 dep 3/01/17) leg on the journey to Australia. Passengers were kept inside of the airplane for 6 hours  while the airplane was remaining on the ground in Moscow airport. SQ did not arrange return of passengers back to the terminal. Neither hot meal was served onboard  (this might have breached russian law by the way) only a pack of chips within 6 hours.  Crew provided little and infrequent information. Some passengers panicked and disembarked. 
We missed our connecting flight to Sydney and had to spend an extra 9 hours waiting for the next flight. As a result of the delay I was supposed to go to work straight from the airport after 38 hours of the prolonged joureney. I asked the airline to upgrade me so that I at least I could arrive in a better shape. I expected a ""premium"" airline to take steps to at least partly rectify their fault. However, Singapore's airlines acted as a budget airline. They suggested to do it for an extra payment despite having spare seats.
SQ asked me to write a detailed letter describing what happend. I spent my time and did that. In response I only received a standard email."
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"07 January,",,"This is Still one of the best airlines. I have been travelling by Singapore airlines for the last 20+ years to travel between San Francisco and Hyderabad. The in-flight service used to be excellent, but I still rate it today as very good. From San Francisco to Hyderabad, there is almost close to 10hr layover in Singapore and that is painful.

I flew in December 2014 from Hyderabad to San Francisco by SQ 5473 and SQ 16. The in-flight service is very good, but I rate their airport check-in, boarding (at Singapore and Hong Kong),  and reservations services to be mediocre. Everything is controlled by Singapore Airlines headquarters at Singapore. There is no clear process for their seat assignment or when they make them available--very poor. They use their subsidiary SilkAir to serve between Singapore and Hyderabad. They have quite confusing baggage rules between these two airlines, especially if you are a Star Alliance member. They published baggage rules on Singapore airlines website and depending on which agent you get to talk to, they will interpret them differently. Watch out!!!"
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"22 October,",,"I recently flew from LAX to Singapore and back on sq 11 and sq 12. I love flying Singapore Airlines. What I like most is - it is very reliable. I can trust it to be on time, on my bags to be safe and on courteous friendly helpful staff. The food varies, sometimes excellent, other times good but always good. What I appreciate most is the friendly helpful air steward and stewardess. They are unfailingly good but every now and again we get excellent ones like a Garry Lee. He warmed the air with his warm friendliness and care and concern for all passengers. It warmed my heart especially when the turbulence gave me some motion sickness. He taught a simple breathing technique which really help. I used to fly EVA, MAS, and the past five years SIA only and would not change it for any other."

I usually fly with Emirates who I have never had a bad experience with.  The 777 was old, had a terrible in flight entertainment system...many of the tvs did not work.  The seat in front of me, it's back kept getting detached and falling on my legs. Air con was centrally controlled and we were freezing. I had three blankets.  Absolutely shocking experience all around. "

Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,,"13 February,",,"I travelled Singapore Airlines from Perth to Singapore in January this year on an A330.   Seating and entertainment were reasonable but on this occasion, the meals were of a very poor standard.  I have travelled on numerous occasions to Singapore (9 times in the last 7 years) on Singapore Airlines and am not usually disappointed but this trip was below par. I travelled with my partner and granddaughter who was aged 6 and the usual activity packs were not supplied.  On the return flight, we were held up on the runway for two and a half hours due to a fuel leak.  During this delay, the staff were excellent and kept us informed as to what was happening. Even though this was not the best flight I have had with this airline, I would travel with them again."

Flight SQ 215 9/03/2023 seat 67G. Once again towards back of plane and aisle seat same thing pushed and shoved entire flight no chance of sleep at all. Due to not feeling well I made a special food booking request of bland, when delivered it was fish,  the steward was very rude and abruptly told me that I had miss ordered.

Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"14 January,",,Travelled Auckland to London via Singapore there and back in December. The direct flight from Auckland to Singapore is a winner but it was on the 777-200 ER and they are really getting very shabby( I flew SQ281 and 282} the entertainment screen is about the size of the IPad mini and impossible to see in daylight. The programme was pretty awful too so I did not miss much as I slept most of the way to Singapore and on the return to Auckland. Do with an up grade on these aircraft SIA. The flight from Singapore to London was pretty good on the more modern 777-300ER and it was great (SQ 308) The return from London to Singapore SQ317 was excellent right up to world standard aircraft and entertainment systems albeit the programme choice was very SIA. Ive flown a lot of times with SIA over the years and they are terrific and do go the extra mile. We had to run the length of terminal 3 At Singapore on the way back as 317 was slightly late... and people thats a long terminal! We just made it for boarding. Did not expect to see our bags in Auckland but hey there they were covered in priority stickers and all first off. too.

Singapore Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"19 May,",,"I previously had positive things to say about Singapore Airlines, but in this case, I was very frustrated. I paid extra for an upgraded seat with extra legroom. Instead, the seat was in front of the exit door and had less legroom. In addition, the TV was broken and so for the entire 16 hour flight, I could not watch any TV. Two thumbs down."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"27 March,",,"I travelled from Manchester U.K. to Houston, Texas and return. This is an outstanding airline, the entire experience from booking to onboard was genuinely exceptional. I had to change my return date and this was handled  with minimum fuss. I found the staff and crew friendly and responsive. 
I travel extensively for business and pleasure and this is by far the best airline I have travelled with. I live in London but this flight was only available from Manchester, it was well worth the effort, and, as I travel to Houston regularly I most certainly will be travelling via  Singapore  Airlines again. As a result of my experience, my son and his family have booked with this airline on this route for their upcoming holiday.     "

Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,Elizabeth Rafferty,"10 August,",,"PREMIUM ECONOMY Singapore to Newark, around 17 + hours. We purchased a RTW ticket.  We took 4 Economy flights and 1 Premium Economy flight.  We have no complaints about the 4 Economy flights.
Some aspects of PE flight were good but others very disappointing. Cabin, seating and entertainment were good but that is where PE ended.  No champagne send off on our flight.  No pre dinner drink at all.
Food was very ordinary and we were only offered 2 meals on this long flight.  They did offer very plain snack food in between but it was pretty bad.  Another complaint was the 12 hours of cabin darkness, just too long for most people. We have travelled PE 2 other times in recent years and they where great.
Only reason I would recommend this flight is time factor.  25 Hours from Perth to Newark."

2. From booking to lounge experience to in-flight service to post-flight service, it's all disappointing quality. It's all at the surface and for appearance, but substance or sincerely. Even the smiles from FAs are fake!"
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"06 November,",,"I was travelling from Singapore to Vietnam at around midday and the heat was quite unbearable. What made things worse was that our flight was delayed for 45mins & we were already in the plane! The vessel was quite dated and the airconditioning was terrible. On the upside, the crew was friendly and prompt. They served the food quickly as I think passengers were being cranky. The seats were pretty comfortable, in my opinion. I was able to sleep through the flight despite the weak AC. Good thing it was a short flight. Some of their planes need upgrading pretty bad. However, I'm quite happy with their service overall and I will still book my flights with them.

EDITORS COMMENT: You're right some planes do need updating but they are in the process of it  - its just takes a while. Thanks for sharing your balanced review with us. "

However, both number has the automatic system and let me choose the Kris Flyer department and reward flight inquiry. So the representative put me to the ""kris flyer dept"" again and I had to wait for it for so long for nothing. I did try to make this call over the weekend already, I had 2-3 times over 1hr wait experience without anyone pick up the phone. Singapore Airline claims the customer service is 24h every day, I wonder how they can make this claim when I had tried multiple times attempts to contact anyone over the phone. All I want to do is to cancel a reward flight, and it is not allowed to do it online. If you let people change flight online, then why not cancel flight? It will save people so much time.

Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"08 July,",,"I recently travelled from Perth to Paris.  I've used Singapore Airlines several times in the past, but on this occasion was very disappointed.  The meals on both the Perth/Singapore and Singapore/Paris were really poor quality and incredibly salty.  The 777 on the Perth leg seemed to have seen better days; the headphones didn't work and the entertainment system was very out-of-date and we were not able to start one movie from the beginning (I travelled recently from Perth/Sydney with Qantas and their touch screen system is really great).  Qantas seemed to lose the plot for a while, but they seem to have lifted their game, with both their food and their service.  On both the Singapore Airlines flights, some of the staff were not really interested.  The food and the service on Perth/Delhi flights with SQ last year were both very good (the Perth/Singapore leg only). We travelled on the A380 through to Paris this time. The seats are incredibly hard and uncomfortable. I'll be going back to Qantas if my flight home from London/Perth has not improved."

Its a good airline with friendly cabin crew and great safety record. Rarely are they behind schedule and connections are rarely missed. Food is average to poor.

Flights to China from Singapore are excellent with newer model 777s and A380s generally not too full. Perth to Singapore and back are always full and not pleasant with the ageing 20 plus year old 777-200s."

The cabin crew were unstinting in their attention. The Boeing was a more pleasant experience then the Airbus; even though it was the older plane. The food was tasty and adequate (as good as it can be in economy). Good beverage and drinks service. The seats could have more padding; I used a blanket on the seat to increase my comfort (I don't have much padding of my own!). One of the best experiences I have had in economy; plus the special fare I paid was great value. 
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"10 November,",,"Booked Business Class tickets purely on feedback from friends and relatives. Were 2 hours late taking off from Perth due to faulty sensor on Cargo door.
Consequently missed onward connection in Singapore and were quickly kept on our way. Full marks for effort, really tried hard. Only blemish IMHO was the use of another airline we had tried to avoid, and to be honest were badly inadequate by Singapore Airline standards....we did not want to go on this flight....really.

I found that the departure time is nice but the return time is way too early in the morning so my travel agent adviced me to use SIA sister company, Silk Air  for the return. Expecting something special  as im paying more money, i didnt find anything special except the extra amenities. The so called Singapore Ladies/stewardess that are heavily advertised on Media are nothing special. I would fare them as OVERRATED so dont be fooled by the apperance from the advertisements, how cute n caring they are.

Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,Leong Yew Kwong,"28 June,",,"Singapore Airlines services are very biased, though I flew on it a couple of times, it seems good services are given if and only if you are either from a western country or you have a wallet stashed with cash to fly Business Class which normally cost $6000 from SIN - MEL - SIN. Nothing impresses me, the IFE are old, they have yet to install touch screens on the aircraft.

I had to fly back to my home country via Singapore airline today, when I recounted my terrible experience with the SIA crew on board. They suggested I contact the station manager in Barcelona for help. To my pleasant surprise, the manager readily agreed to help and are in the process of not only not only liaising with Vueling but also to transport the luggage back to me. The service level is outstanding and beyond one's expectations. There is no question that I will fly Singapore airlines wherever possible!"

We were absolutely let down with the service and the attitude of the air hostesses was appalling. The service was awful and the cabin crew were curt and pretty blunt. we travelled with our infant and there was a mix up of our seats to begin with and my wife and 4 month infant, which was corrected however. Mid flight we were told to use the toilets which were 20 rows of seats away while holding an infant through turbulence. when requested that it is too far to hold an infant and get there, they were blunt saying that the other restrooms are reserved for only business class. The captain had already said that the flight was going to be turbulent due to a weather report all they way till Singapore. So here we are mid flight holding an infant and walking through the aisle and fearing for the baby's safety while the crew nonchalantly went about serving food while we waited to return to our seats. This just proves that Singapore airlines is just like all other just value money and not the customers. Had we known this earlier we would have booked our regular airlines"

And having flown from Sydney to Manchester and Manchester to Sydney many times only ever using Emirates and Qantas I found a cheap deal with Singapore airlines and thought I'd give them ago. Now being from England emirates are one of the most advitised and so I thought was the best airline. How I have been very wrong. In economy the seat sizes seem pretty much the same but with Singapore I found the seat cushions were a lot softer. The major difference I found with singapore was the service. They made me feel like a queen! They were always smiling and welcoming. And this being a night flight they didn't sit down for four hours for next meal time they circled with drinks and snacks in between more than once! And it wasn't just a little sack of peanut's like other airlines. They were going out of their way to ensure I was happy and comftable. If you get the choice to fly singapore, don't hesitate! "

I said automatically changing my premium economy to economy without check marking that segment is ridiculous.

Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"12 May,",,"Do you want to experience 6 Star Travel in Economy Class? Then, you're in luck. Singapore Airlines ""Trumps"" all the rest in every category. Pardon the pun. I recently had the great privilege of travelling from Amsterdam, Holland to Singapore on Singapore Airlines, and what an experience it was. From the moment I arrived at the airline's check-in counter I was overwhelmed by the friendliness and willingness of the staff to assist me in my hour of need. I had torn my Achillies Tendon whilst rock climbing, and was in a surgical boot to help mend the torn tendon and ease the pain somewhat. I must admit that; at first I was a bit dubious about receiving any special consideration; because I did not speak a word of Dutch and was not accustomed to receiving anything but than less than ordinary service from other airlines. Unlike other airlines I've travelled with; who run their business lean and mean; this airline was well prepared for any and all contingencies.
There was no shortage of staff here. Two staff initially attended to me pushing me wherever I needed to go in a well appointed wheelchair. "

I was surprised that the lead crew (a nice malay steward) greated us by our name from the time we step in until the time we were collected our luggage.  He took the extra effort. I and hubby was happy with the service. Thumps up to all the crew on that flight. Hope to meet you all again. Thanks

Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,Gary Hanson,"07 January,",,"I have always rated Sing Air highly, efficient, clean, and excellent service however Cairns to Singapore is a definite exception.  737 max is cramped and barely suitable for a 6-hour + Trip. A full flight with only 2 rear toilets is a huge issue, with continuous lines stretching down the cabin and the passengers at the rear half of the aircraft understandably getting agitated.  By 2 hours out the toilets were disgusting.  The seats were uncomfortable and numbing.  Very  unsatisfactory flight  not reccommended"
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"27 September,",,"We travelled a combined economy / premium enconomy as SA do not have a premium flight ex Perth . Our trip was Perth/San Francisco returning New York / Perth . The section of the flight causing complaint was New York /Singapore 9/25/16 . The 380 looked old dirty and tired internally toilets grubby , cabin walls marked and chipped both tvs failed during the longest leg the food wa very average what did we get for the huge price difference nothing  there was nothing that showed the premium difference False Advertising we have flown SA since late 70's the have lost it . Premium must mean what word implies their competitors  leave them for dead   It's a growing level of service but SA are giving no indication that it matters . On the first section Perth Singapore my wife's seat was broken and could only be used upright we thought things can only improve ...so wrong but never again . We would change our return leg Singapore/ Perth in 3 days if it was not for the fuss and expense . But rest assured SA we will be your loudest critics to anyone who listens .One ripoff too many ."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"10 January,",,"This is the only airlines I will fly. Just had the good fortune of traveling by Singapore airlines from San Francisco to Vietnam and India. Impeccable service, most friendly and professional staff. When I exited the plane I had left my pair of reading glasses on the aircraft, a staff came running after me and handed me my glasses.

US based airlines can learn a thing or two about service. I tolerate United airlines and there crappy and sub-standard service simply because I can earn miles in Singapore airlines. This is the platinum standard for airlines and no North American airlines can or will ever come remotely close to Singapore airlines in service, courtesy. "
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"06 December,",,"Flew with Singapore Airlines on several flights recently.  Manchester to Singapore on 24th October, Brisbane to Singapore, 23rd November and Singapore to Manchester via Munich on 23rd November.  Everything was as expected.  Staff very efficient and friendly.  Food good and seats comfortable. "
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"12 July,",,"I flew Singapore Airlines From Melbourne to Colombo with transit in Singapore a few days ago and the journey was fantastic. Check in at Melbourne was a breeze and they even offered me a window seat on the A380 which was awesome. This was the first time I had flown SQ after nearly 15 years and the standards they maintain have not changed. In flight entertainment is a treat by its self with a dual touch screens and some fantastic choices. I'm not into games or movies so I listened to classic rock and watched a few documentaries. The food too was fantastic. Above all, the air stewardesses (the Singapore Girls) were really sweet and nice which made a world of difference. Its not surprising that SQ is considered the best airline in the world serving out of in my opinion the best airport in the world."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"09 October,",,"The service was fantastic throughout the flight. I took singapore airlines from Sin to Milan. I was impressed by their non-stop drink service throughout the flight to ensure that we were always hydrated. 
The in-flight entertainment is great and the food is great too!

However, they should improve on their inflight announcements, it was difficult to understand some of the announcements. The command of the language can be improved.

EDITORS COMMENT: They do offer an excellent economy class service."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"09 September,",,Awesome.
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"26 October,",,"I've always enjoyed by Singapore Airlines flight but my recent return flight from Cape Town to Bangkok was not up to the standard I was expecting. The aircraft, a Boeing 777, was old with an in-flight entertainment system that had seen better days.
And the food was pretty mediocre. Fortunately, the crew were top-notch. 
Singapore need to understand that there is competition on this route from the Middle Eastern carriers, who often use newer aircraft with fantastic in-flight entertainmnent systems and better food."

Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"11 March,",,"very disappointed with the flight back to UK from Singapore on the A380 on 3rd march 2016 I had to change my flight so I asked for extra leg room on the upper deck which I thought I had paid for but the call centre did not book this for me so we were seated in row 82 upper deck next to the smelly / dirty toilets(urine  on the floor) No member of staff cleaned it up or sprayed fresh air I only saw them check it twice. also the staff were not very helpful There seemed to be a lack of staff on the economy side (only saw 3 ) unlike the business side which had far more staff.  When it came to meal times not only was there a poor selection  and the quality was again very poor  meat tough and tasteless also  luke warm coffee was cold and very strong ,all in all I felt the standard had gone down since the last time I flew on this plane. It was in complete contrast to the flight from Perth to Singapore 3 days before when we travelled on the 777, staff helpful , extra leg room was booked when I changed the flight   toilets were checked every half hour and sprayed with fresh air,  good selection of food also very hot and tasty .a much better experience  "
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"04 July,",,Most aspects of our trip to and from Europe were disappointing. Your feedback form is very discouraging so I have not bothered. I will not be flying SQ again.

Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"19 December,",,"I had been told that traveling in a Singapore Airlines flight is an experience in itself, but I'm sorry to say that it was not the case for me. I've definitely had better flight experiences. Below are the reasons why I wouldn't recommend Singapore Airlines:
1. As soon as I entered the flight, there was a foul smell of urine, probably emanating from the lavatory at the front of the business class section. I thought the smell would disappear once I was inside, but I was wrong. The air spray came on only after everyone had settled in and the plane was taxiing down the runway. 
2. The food is OK. Regular stuff. Nothing exotic or out-of-the-box. I don't know why a menu is offered when the actual meal given is pretty different from what's offered on the menu. 
3. I was seated in the middle seat on the center aisle. The steward completely skipped asking me what beverage I wanted. I could have asked for it myself, but that's not hospitality.
4. In a 4 & half hour flight, you don't get to sleep even a wink because of the in-flight meal trauma. The stewards take more than hour just to serve and clear the trays. Even if you opt not to eat during your flight, you still anyway get disturbed."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"10 December,",,"My seat was chosen beforehand and printed on the air ticket, but there was a sudden change without my prior agreement. The passenger next to me was rather rude, so I requested for a change of seat to my original one but this was not met. I had to sit near the emergency exit, which was rather uncomfortable and there was not a proper table. My luggage after transit was late. Overall I had an awful experience and was not satisfied at all. Hope the airline will continue to work and improve on this. "
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"26 June,",,"Have flown from Melbourne to London and back, with Singapore about 10 times in the last 4 years. Always very well looked after. No complaints at all. Their timetable is also very good as you can avoid jetlag with their body friendly timetable."

Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"06 March,",,"My wife and we're excited first about traveling to Singapore and secondly going on Singapore Airlines.  Our travels started in Louisville, Ky flying to JFK on Delta and then transferring to Singapore to Frankfurt and onto Singapore. We traveled in Business Class and were assured that our four pieces of luggage would be transferred at JFK from Delta to Singapore and in fact the luggage tags were  checked through to Singapore .  After arriving to JFK I talked to three individuals including the gate agent assuring us that our luggage was ON the plane when in fact it was NOT.  When we got to Singapore 21 hours later we were informed that our luggage is still sitting at JFK.  We are to get aboard our ship tomorrow with no luggage. They said they would let me know later today if it will be on the plane tonight.  This could have been avoided if they would have followed through with what they assured us.  Extremely disappointing.

The flight was excellent. The food superb and flight staff excellent. Sad they really don't handle the front end very well. Actually JFK Singapore does not have very much awareness there. Hard  to find gates and lounge.
Overall not happy as we have no luggage."
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"31 January,",,"Beware the stopover in Singapore with this airline. Our family flew to Laos with Singapore airlines and my husband returned home directly for work. Our 3 teenagers and myself stayed in Singapore for 4 nights on the way back. 
We were charged $437.50 PER PERSON i.e. $1750 for this. On repeated enquiry to the airline the only explanation that was given was that the flights were a different code. Departure tax was mentioned, with more asking as to why this charge, but this amounts to about $30 per person. I would expect a national airline to be encouraging passengers to stop and spend money in their country not penalise them to do so
We won't be flying this airline again"
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"28 January,",,"Flew on Christmas Eve 2014 from Durban--Johannesburg--Singapore--Malaysia, excellent service from the flight crew. Best airline food I've had. Overall excellent experience. I was also able to check-in my luggage straight from my initial destination to my final which was appreciated."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"22 June,",,"Impressive airline. 
Excellent customer service. Tasty food. Comfortable planes. 

Check in and luggage delivery went smoothly."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"03 July,",,"The airplane food & the size of the TVs on the plane were slightly above average. However, due to the service I received on SQ173 on 06/11/15 seats 40A-E, this will be the first & last time I ride with Singapore Airlines. We had a delay of 1.5 hrs which was only bothersome to me because there was a stewardess  who was rude to my husband when asking her to fix a broken entertainment system. We pressed the service button to inform her of the issue after my husband tried many button-clicks to get the remote & entertainment system to respond. She comes over annoyed & starts condescendingly pressing all the buttons. She then commands, ""I'm going to reset. Don't touch for 10 minutes."" She could've spoken to my husband more politely. She also skipped my daughter when asking for drinks who was sitting next to me & moved to the row in front of us. When I asked her why my daughter was skipped, instead of apologizing, she was defensive. I really think Singapore Airlines should train their stewards to have better service because that's what sets airlines apart. Consumers have way too many options to settle on an airline that doesn't care about their customers."
Singapore Airlines,0 / 10,ar,"04 September,",,"Booked a Singapore to Paris (return) flight on their Premium Economy flight launched early in the 2015 back 3 months ago. Now with only a month to go to my departure date and with all my train bookings, car rentals and hotels confirmed and fully paid, YESTERDAY on 3 September,  Singapore airlines simply announces on their website that their refurbishment of the A380 for the Premium Economy is delayed by 3-4 months (CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT) .. and our booked and paid up flight cannot be fulfilled and offered my Economy flight instead in exchange for PITTANCE.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  If the delay of refurbishment affects flights from September till December for the Paris leg, it meant that Singapore Airlines would have already known back in June when we bought the tickets correct? So why did they not come clean then? OR you trying to save face then because you had so  much marketing campaign? OR you are so  messed up internally that your Operations and Marketing teams don't talk?
Everyone, the once world class Singapore Airlines is no more. They negate on their commitments. Worst than budget airlines now. "

Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"18 October,",,"Perth to Singapore in business class was very good, the staff and food were first class. The Perth lounge could do with updating.
Singapore to London in business class, we were booked on a A380 but this was changed to a 777 ER. our flight was a night time so we were looking forward to a nights sleep. The lie flat beds were very uncomfortable, having to lie across the bed at a angle. the cabin service was good.
Return flight London to Singapore on the A380, same bed set up, very disappointed, this bed is way behind other carriers we have flown with.
Will not fly with them again until the bed/seat if updated."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,Me Christer,"21 May,",,"I have just completed a long haul journey in Business Class flying Four of my longest flights with Singapore Air.

The ground staff at Perth Airport provided a lovely start to  our holiday with a smooth and helpful checkin. The flight attendants on our Perth to Singapore, Singapore to Copenhagen and our return flights were all very polite, professional and helpful.  The seats were very comfortable.  One segment was on a brand new plane which was outstanding.  We were delayed leaving Copenhagen by the Danish airport and as I had booked a short gap in between flights we were  late for our connection to Perth.  We were met off the flight by a Singapore  Airline staff member and she explained we had missed our flight, she had rebooked us on a flight later that day, we were provided with accommodation in the Crowne Plaza at the airport for the day with breakfast and  lunch provided.   Absolutely fantastic service and staff are always so nice to customers.  Really left us feeling very well looked after."

Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"04 January,",,"Steady downward define of service level.  Flew Haneda-Changi 0800 flight that lands at Changi  about 4PM.  In the whole flight, served only a light breakfast (Croissant+Eggs+Beverage).  To catch an 0800 flight you need to be awake at 5:30AM and rushing to catch the flight, easily miss breakfast.  7 hour flight with 2 hour boarding and only 1 meal is ludicrous, especially whats the trip spans breakfast and well past lunch.  WHAT is Management thinking ?  This is not the standard of a ""World leading"" Carrier.

I'm astounded that SQ has fallen so far from its previous standard.  Stewardesses also have lost their classy and pleasing ways.  Training is lacking as they don't seem to understand basic hospitality principles.  Chief Steward was OK but it was clear he's old school.
Management decisions to cut corners is cheapening this airlines.   SQ is more interested at maximising profits than preserving their brand.  In all honesty, it can no longer claim to be one of the best airlines -- and management should take care that they don't drop to the ""bad"" category.  They are seriously out of Emirates / Qatar Airlines class ."
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"28 August,",,"Flew Perth - Heathrow and return with Singapore airlines in July/August 2014.

Perth - Singapore leg A330
Singapore - Heathrow leg B777-300
Heathrow - Singapore leg A380 - 8000
Singapore - Perth leg B777 - 200

A good variety of aircraft types here and all provided a good service and standard of comfort that you would expect in Economy class.

Entertainment systems provided a good variety and the meals were quite acceptable, although on the Singapore - Heathrow leg all meals on offer were quite spicy and although I enjoyed them they were not to my wife's taste.

The seats selected on the return journey were the upper deck of the A380.  This is for couples a better choice than the main cabin as layout is 2-4-2, and the window seat has a very useful compartment at the fuselage side.

All in all Singapore airlines tried to make a 13 hour non stop flight as comfortable as possible and the shorter Perth - Singapore trips were just fine.

Boarding was handled smoothly with ground staff enforcing the load from the rear policy - well done, but why don't airlines enforce the cabin baggage restrictions as overhead lockers were all full and too many passengers had oversize or multiple articles of cabin luggage."

Singapore Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"09 March,",,"After I saw so many reviews I can't not put my review in. I'm very disappointed with Singapore airlines. I thought they were the best. 3 years ago when me and my husband flew from Singapore to LOs Angeles. The seat that  we were in was warm seems the air con is not working imagine how many hours we have to suffered, also service was terrible. After that we flew again a year after to give it ago and the service from the flight attendant were terrible. I was not saying that I was unreasonable. I am in the service industry too and I understand how important is my own brand and customer service. Yes customers are not always right. But really Singapore airlines your service and your flight attendant is going down hill. Maybe you will not do anything about it. I am thinking twice now to fly with your airlines especially with young family. I will not get any great service. "
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"25 March,",,"I recently flew Singapore Airlines from Perth to Colombo, Sri Lanka return. I am a frequent flyer with Qantas however connections into South Asia just aren't as good as other carriers. As far as the flight experience with Singapore, they are undoubtedly one of the best for service, and are known for it. From check-in through to cabin staff, service was impeccable and the plane was an A330, fully finished and appeared quite new. Being a frequent flyer with Qantas left me without some of the comforts that I am used to. Loss of lounge access is one, particularly between flights and my normal forward aisle seat was of course moved right down the back in a middle seat. The flight wasn't overly crowded so that was a positive.

The flight timings coming back were not that great  leaving Colombo, from memory 1.20am isn't ideal but most planes on this route seem to overnight, so probably can't be helped. Connections were tight so that was a positive.

Now that Malaysian has joined Oneworld I will try them out next to this part of the world"
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,,"04 November,",,"This review is for 2 different business class flights on 2 different trips. LA to Narita and Narita to Singapore. There's a reason they're the best and their business class didn't disappoint. The only negative was my wife's seat had tomato sauce on the console from a previous passenger that she cleaned off herself. The plane comfort, food, staff, online check in, customer service leading up to flight and lounge were all top notch. We highly recommend them and hope to fly with them again. My previous international business class experience is with Delta and Turkish Airlines."

On board of SQ 856, the cutleries dropped on my husband while the flight attendant was collecting the tray from the passenger behind his seat.

The breakfast served was not fantastic.

While returning on SQ 871, the roll bun was not served with the dinner and the dinner served was not as good as before.  The trays were not collected timely.

On both flights, the flight attendances were not very professional.  They took orders but did not return.

Some of the passengers were seen struggling to put their handheld luggages at the top hang cabin.  

The inflight programmes were limited."

Both planes were a little aged but the smiling and happy crews made you feel a million dollars. The quality of food, wine and attention to detail was excellent.
Would suggest some Australian Airlines should have a good look at themselves.
I have been a very loyal patron to the major airlines in Australia, however feel Singapore has beaten them hands down. Congratulations and thank you."

EDITORS COMMENT: They are one of the best for sure!"
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"29 September,",,"Interior design of the aircraft we flew in were not appealing, particularly the A380 which looked old. I flew in an A380 six months ago with Etihad and the aircraft looked fresh and vibrant, which in turn created a much needed amount of positive energy for a long-haul flight.

The entertainment system (Krisworld) was patchy at best as there would be a 1-2 second lag every 5minutes making the viewing experience quite frustrating. Every so often, the movie/show you were watching would just switch off and return to the main menu so you had replay the movie and fast forward to where you were up to.

I think the airline put more effort into designing the onboard food menu than actually producing quality meals. The curries all tasted the same and was borderline sickening.

Staff were friendly enough but some don't enforce the 'seat upright when eating' rule and we had to take matters into our own hands.

Disappointed overall for an airline with Singapore Airlines reputation."
Singapore Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"17 May,",,"I previously had positive things to say about Singapore Airlines, but in this case, I was very frustrated.

I paid extra for an upgraded seat with extra legroom.

Instead, the seat was in front of the exit door and had less legroom. 

In addition, the TV stand was broken and so for the entire 16 hour flight, I could not watch any TV. 

Two thumbs down."

Although seating in Economy was adequate, the quality of food was just terrible. And all of the choices of Entertainment, we only watched one movie each.
Cabin staff were excellent which saved the day."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"26 September,",,I have travelled Singapore airlines three times now in Economy over the past several months. I have found that it is pot luck whether the customer service is friendly and efficient or rude and officious. It's the only airline I have experienced (and I have experienced a lot of them) where I get the feeling that the cabin staff are looking down their nose at the economy class passengers. I have decided not to fly with them again for this reason.

Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"29 September,",,"Flew from LAX to Tokyo Narita both ways. Service was very good and accommodating. The team was very gracious when they made mistakes. I flew next to an Indian man on the way to Tokyo who was vegetarian and had pre-ordered a vegetarian meal when he ordered his ticket. They ran out of vegetarian options, so he did not get a meal. The attendant scrambled to find non-meat sides to at least get him some food, and then made sure he was comped vegetarian meals on all his connecting flights to India for that trip. I was impressed as you would never see that happen with an American company.

The negative: I did notice that a few controllers for the seat back entertainment were not working, including my partner's who was seated next to me. Also, on the flight back I got food poisoning from their ""beef"" option almost immediately. Within an hour of eating it I was spraying from both ends. By the time I reached LAX I had nothing in my stomach left to puke. But it didn't stop there...I ended up throwing up in front of the LAX international building and didn't get to make our side trip into LA as planned because I could barely move. 

In summary do not take your chances with the beef option."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"21 June,",,"My wife & I were to fly to Osaka to join a cruise in 2011 but the earthquake & tsunami forced a change of plan so that the cruise started in Hong Kong. The airline demanded a fee of over $100 each to change the booking (reimbursed by the cruise line), but refused a refund for the much lesser value of the airfare, about $300 total. The excuse given was that refunds only applied for flights both into & out of Japan. For this reason, we shall not fly with this company again."
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"11 June,",,"We have flown Singapore Airlines when traveling internationally for over 20 years.  There has been a considerable drop off in the level of service in recent years  

The most recent trip to Europe was a huge deterioration in service 3 of 4 sectors were particularly poor.  The flight  from Perth to Singapore had a crew that had obviously taken their grumpy pills before boarding, the attendants being noticeably curt, then again I have noticed this on crews that service the Perth route.  

The sector from Singapore to Frankfurt was as I remember Singapore Airlines friendly service with a smile, couldn't ask for more.

On the return sector from Amsterdam to Singapore  the service could only be described as horrific , e.g. a request for water had to be made several times and took 45 minutes, in mid flight fruit was offered however when it came to our row the fruit was all gone and we were offered a bag of chips instead! the crew appeared to be in a state of confusion most of the time and not interested in the passengers. The food was particularly poor on this sector, in 13 hours we got a light lunch after take off and breakfast just before landing(and they couldn't get that right).  10 hours between meals is a long time! Oh I forgot we were offered a bag of potato chips mid flight.

The Singapore to Perth sector was all business like and curt as like the outgoing sector.  On the upside the check in was still efficient at all sectors the flight crew did their job and got us to our destinations without any problems.  The 777s used on all sectors were looking tired and in need of a refit on one sector the sound unit didn't function  and on others there were intermittent faults"

Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,,"14 February,",,"I quite often fly Singapore Airlines from Perth, Singapore and Vietnam for business.  This airline is fairly consistent in that the whole flying experience is usually efficient, friendly and comfortable.  However, one consistency I don't enjoy is that on the Perth- Singapore leg the aircraft is never as clean, the (hot) food is quite often cold or not fresh and the entertainment system does not work properly.  Things are always much better on the Singapore -Vietnam leg which more often than not has a plane full of (non-Australian) business people.  Do Australian passengers not warrant the same service as people from other countries"
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,David Broadbent,"14 June,",,Flew Perth to Istanbul return. Exceptional device by cabin crews on all flights. Nice aircraft on both Perth - Singapore legs. Airline flys their retrofitted 777-200ER between Singapore and Turkey which are at least 17 years old.

Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"24 November,",,"I traveled from SFO to HYD. The first segment was good. But then being a Star Alliance gold, I was not given lounge access because, my next flight was in Silk Air although my ticket was through Singapore Air. Silk Air is like Tiger air, only difference being food served in Silk Air. Leg room is small, no movies on board, no star alliance preference, no mileage accrual. With an 8 hr wait in Singapore, I am really disappointed at the treatment of Star Alliance gold passengers by Singapore Air."

As I had some issues on my connection to SQ1 the ground manager at SFO and HKIA were super nice and look after me since I was somewhat distraught. They both showed professionalism and empathy.  I was looked after very well. 

As these are long haul flights you can be assured that a cabin crew is always around unlike other airline where you need to find the crew just to get some water.

I need to begin by stating that three of the four legs of this trip were fine, in comfortable aircraft with OK staff. However, the flight from Singapore to Istanbul was in an old plane (777-200) with most uncomfortable seats I have experienced. When I first sat down I thought I must have sat on something, but no, it was the thin and lumpy seat. The only way I could get comfortable was to request another pillow and blanket just to sit on. Other passengers were doing the same. My son and his partner also complained about their flight from Copenhagen to Brisbane recently with Singapore Airlines and they had the same experience, also on a 777-200. Also, in-flight entertainment screen was small, and mine stopped working halfway through the flight, so I read a book."
Singapore Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"13 May,",,"We missed our connecting flight from Singapore to Frankfurt because our flight from Koh Samui was late. First, we were only offered a flight with another stop in Zurich which we found not acceptable. After two hours waiting in the airport of Koh Samui, they organized a direct flight. All 5 family members got disconnected seats. Finally, we arrived in Frankfurt with 10 hours delay. This was not nice, but may happen. 
Even worse is that the air condition in the plain from Singapore to Frankfurt was malfunctioning. While the temperature was OK in the front of the aircraft, it was unacceptable cold and draughty in the back. For this reason, my wife stood most of the time in the aisle until after 10 hours a flight assistant could organize another seat for her. 
We complained to the airline after the flight, but were disappointed by their reply.
Food quality was also pretty bad. "
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"17 July,",,"7 hour delay in flight after many passengers were sent back and forth to two different location x 3 times with incorrect information, I join extremely long queue to get free hotel in city tickets for the night and a meal voucher. 
After 30 minutes queuing in pain (x2 fractures in back) I left queue to see if I could find someone where in hotel to sleep but was unsuccessful.   I returned to information desk, no hotel tickets or meal voucher left and no-one to could help."

Thank you very much SQ, for the past many years in staying excellence in service & product and putting safety first at all time. 
Cheers! "
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,Carole Ottway,"09 January,",,"Many years ago I flew exclusively with SIA.  This time my decision was exclusively based on price difference between them and Qantas.  My memories of this airline were excellent, and overall I was pleased this time.  On the flight to Singapore, the movies selection disappointed me.   I watched a couple and was pleased I had not paid money to see them.  On the return journey, none had been added, so I did not bother.
Someone wrote about seats not being that comfortable.  I mentioned to a steward that Qantas had a covering which was placed over the seat to make it more comfortable. A blanket put on the seat resulted and improved this problem markedly.
Food was excellent as was the service.
I should mention for the benefit of passengers from Brisbane, that the food and service in the SIA lounge at Brisbane International airport was exceptional."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"14 January,",,Only issue is seating assignment not available early 
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,Karen Calnin,"09 July,",,"Recently flew between Adelaide and Singapore on the medium haul 350/900. I have never felt so cramped on a medium haul flight. Once the seat in front is reclined you can hardly move. Anyone who is on the larger side will not be able to put their tray table fully down. The seats do not seem to have much padding. We did not get a meal or even a light snack on the night flight until breakfast. Queuing for the toilets is difficult due to the lack of space . 
Some people would suggest if one isnâ€™t happy then upgrade but not everyone can afford business class or even premium class. 
We have always used Singapore Airlines but if we do not have to go through Singapore in future I doubt now that we will. 
On a brighter note their long haul flights were very good but we have to take the medium haul leg as well when travelling to Europe."
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"08 September,",,"Hi,
I just took SQ223 from Singapore to Perth today at 9:30am. 
As a frequent flyer of my own national airline, I must say I am very disappointed with the in flight experience that I received today. The standard welcome drink and peanuts were not served and the food portion was reduced and not up to standard. I wasn't even served tea or coffee after the meal. The flight attendants were moving up and down ,oblivious to serving the passengers. I have taken many SQ flights before to Perth and I have never felt so shortchanged like this morning! It seems like they are cutting corners and it can seen just from the food tray. Serving cheap Magnum ice cream instead of Haagen Dazs which we used to get. We paid the standard airfare for our economy flight and didn't expect this sort of service. I wonder why standards have slipped. 
I really hope SIA will look into this deterioration of service seriously. I am a Singaporean and I feel very ashamed that they could not maintain what made them a good airline in the first place.

May SIA seriously reflect on their service standards and not take their customers trust for granted. Cutting corners is a very dishonest way of doing business. "
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"02 October,",,"I always fly Singapore Airlines from Manila to Australia, i tried other airlines such as Qantas, MAS, Cathay all in Business Class but none well maybe Cathy can close to second from SQ. From the check-in counter till you leave, they will take care of you. I have yet to try the long haul first class and that needs to be experienced only with Singapore. Though some of their airlines lack the flat beds going to Perth but still a good value for money or even use of miles. "
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"15 August,",,"I traveled from SFO to BOM (via Incheon and Singapore) and back and I was extremely pleased with the service. Last time I had traveled by Emirates and it was horrible. The on-board crew were extremely courteous. Even when one of the flights was delayed due to the weather at Mumbai, information about connecting flights etc was readily available. Food, beverages and on-board entertainment was excellent. Overall a very pleasant experience."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"31 December,",," Amsterdam to Singapore 777-300ER
Singapore-Sydney 777-300ER

Sydney-Singapore Airbus A380
Singapore-Amsterdam 777-300ER

Alle the flights left in time,very friendly staff and good service.
Clean toilets.
A bit of a dissapointment were the desserts,I ve ordered a vegetarian meal but that included only fruit for dessert.
Would have been nice if it would have been an icecream or something like that.
Because my passport was valid for an other 5Ã‚Â½ month after departure in Amsterdam I wasn't able to check in on line nor make my own choice for a seat.
Had to check in at the airport."
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,,"07 February,",,"Singapore airlines never fail to impress me with their quality of staff, service, food, beverages, snacks bars, in flight entertainment and arguably the best economy blankets in the sky. A recent flight to Europe was no different  except for the aircraft and their seating. Our trip involved travel on an A330, A380 and 777-200. The A330 was great - couldn't fault a thing; the A380 had less seat recline than the A330 and the seat was harder which I found uncomfortable on such a long flight; then there was the tired old 777-200... the seat whilst having the best recline of all of them had lost its ability to ""cushion"" so to speak and all the bits and pieces that are supposed to inflate to create extra support simply didn't. The in fight entertainment was also quite outdated when compared to other SIngapore Airlines aircraft. I still hold this airline up there as one of the best in the world but the in flight product continuity they used to pride themselves on is starting to wane"
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"01 January,",,"Not worth the trouble in economy. They split my friend and I on a 17 hr flight, in spite of the fact tickets were bought five months ahead. The seat selection on the website did not work on multiple attempts. Not one of three different gate agents even tried to help us. Extremely poor customer service. Singapore did not live up to their reputation. The rest of economy was no different from any other airline. Save youraelf a headache: fly Qatar or Emirates."
Singapore Airlines,0 / 10,Charles Thompson,"31 August,",,"Singapore Airlines is rated as the best airline in the world, but their customer service has to be the worst I have dealt with. 

Singapore Air neglected to confirm my connecting flight with their partner airline, causing me to miss my flight to Singapore. When confronted with this, they offered to rebook my flight for later that night for a $400 fee and a downgrade in cabin class. Not only did they force me to pay a premium, they did not refund me the cost of the cabin upgrade that I paid for. 

I could never speak to a manager - none of my emails have been returned. They were able just to do whatever they wanted to me, and I had no power at all. Now I am going to miss my first day of my new job, I am out $400, 70000 points, and all of my stuff is in Singapore without me, and there is no option to do anything about it."
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"16 October,",,"I recently convinced colleagues to travel to Manila for work using a combination of airlines including Singapore airlines as I had travelled happily with them some years ago.  These recent flights, however, were extremely disappointing.   The air conditioning wasn't working properly, the seats were extremely old fashioned, there was a poor selection of movies and the food was pretty awful e.g. bread rolls were hard as a rock.  I hoped it was only the Singapore to Manila route, but on the return flight from Singapore to Auckland it was equally poor, despite the plane being a newer 777.  I would really hesitate to book another flight with Singapore airlines.  Suggest you check carefully if it's likely to be a flight with an upgraded interior."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"10 June,",,"Have flown to UK every year for about 15 years and always had the best of attention from the staff.  The connection times from Perth to Heathrow are very convenient with a stop-over in KL of two and a half hours.
Breakfast served on KL to Perth leg has always been disappointing and needs improvement. The aircraft travelled on are A330, B777, B747 on the Perth - KL - Heathrow journey and I look forward to the A380 on the next trip in November. next"
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"16 December,",,We as a family travelled from Brisbane to Singapore on SQ256 on 14th December 16. We were provided exceptional service by Vick and his team members. They were polite and above and beyond to make our trip very enjoyable and comfortable. Thank you. Vick and the team and Singapore airlines our favourite airline. Thanks again. Rodney John 
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,,"12 February,",,Crew was really nice!!! If you need help they come fast to you! Seat was sooo nice but only you don't have a good engine view in the business class. What I hate on the flight was the airco I was really sick.
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"23 April,",,"Hi Team, Thanks for giving me an opportunity to review my flight experience. I am a fairly new traveller with Singapore Airlines with 7 trips in 2014 usually from Singapore to & fro my homeland India or my reporting office in Germany. Am already on their top miles list. Today returned from my short Easter vacation with a round trip Pune-Mumbai-Singapore in Business class on 421 & 422. They got Spacious seats with extendable leg space for sleeping. Excellent Service- I was wearing a skirt & without me asking, they offered me comfy blankets & head rest within minutes on the flight journey so I wouldnt feel cold. Am also impressed that they serve the best inflight fresh food. You must not miss their 'Book the Cook'option and their speciality is the delicious Lobster Thermidor, which the stewardess recommended to me. You will return to thank me here for recommending this super menu dish for your next Singapore Airlines flight. They provide supersonic headphones, no shortage of wines & proactively assist with channel changing or games. The best of all- all of the staff pronounced my difficult name correctly and the stewardess offered to fill in my Landing visa form & to my surprise, my luggage was already towed in advance to my waiting car so I wont have to wait at the terminal after my flight.  Hats off to Singapore Airlines! You truly are the best, amongst the rest. thanks again for such an Over-the-Air experience :) - Aphrosh"
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"04 January,",,"SFO-SIN-SFO Nov/Dec 2016  Economy class with small fee upgrade for window seat behind exit row with no seat in front of me.  A new and quiet A350 for the 15-16 hour non-stop flight.  Cabin service and in-flight entertainment were superb.  This airline knows how to make a long flight bearable.  Galley was always open to pax to get a glass of juice or water and a snack.  Sandwiches too, just ask.  Meal began with menu in economy class, then a hot cloth towel service, and then a generous meal.  Repeat again with different meal selection after 8 hours.  Cabin crew inspected restrooms hourly to replenish supplies and tidy up if needed.  SFO counter service was over the top efficient and friendly.  I felt like I was a First Class frequent flyer when I left the service counter.  A wonderful airline experience for someone accustomed to US flag carriers (mal)treatment."
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"18 August,",,Terrible service from SIA which is reputated to provide excellent customer service. They have no integrity unlike what they preach. 
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"23 July,",,This airline needs to lift its game. I flew Cairns to Singapore on a fully booked flight at FULL PRICEThe seats are narrow and uncomfortable. There was NO INFLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT. For six hour flight. The toilets were crowded with long waits. This is Budget standard. Not good enough.
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"15 February,",,"I tarvelled to Kochi with my family from Brisbane on 13th December 2016 and returned to Brisbane from Kochi (India) on 20th January. We travelled Kochi every alternative year from Melbourne to Kochi since 2009 by Singapore Airlines. This tme we travelled from Brisbane. I tried Air Asia in between but went back to Singapore Airlines due to higher quality. But my latest experience with SIA has left me feeling dissapointed. On every other trip, the food we got was above average, especially for economy class,. But this time, the food was absolutely horrible. I got a pork sausage with egg and vegetables. The sausage was dry, the egg was far too cooked and the vegetables were almost raw. The second meal wasn't much better. I also noticed a dip in service quality. I had been warned by my friend that Singapore Airlines were losing their standards. He had a horrible experience but I opted to remain due to my trust in the airline. I now deeply regret this descision. "
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"19 August,",,"Living on their reputation - old 777's showing their age, indifferent food and poor inflight entertainment only counterbalanced by attentive crew."
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"04 October,",,"The extra legroom is good until the seat in front is reclined. The leg rest does not come up high enough and the footrest is the same as economy class. The footrest seems to be out of alignment with the passengers legs, resulting in the feet falling off to the side of the footrest. The headrest does not raise very high, causing the head  to be pushed uncomfortably forward. The headphones have a sharp ridge in the centre, hurting the ears. The wine and food are both good as is the priority boarding and baggage retrieval.  While it is better than economy, I feel it is not worth the extra cost. The main reason for this is that the comfort level is not greatly enhanced over economy."
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,,"08 November,",,"i have travelled several with singapore airlines and as far as I am concerned they are the best inn the world. Friendly courteous staff,"
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"03 September,",,"Food was terrible. Egg noodles was dry and taste like crap. Nasi goreng was tasteless as well. 
Airline staff was fantastic "
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,Rafael Williams Veazey,"04 March,",,"Amazing, all round."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"08 June,",,"We travelled on Singapore Airlines business class from Melbourne to Hong Kong in May on the midnight flight. The service from take off to landing was first class. Tattinger champagne before and after take off and then a ''book the cook meal'', a couple of glasses of chardonnay and then a slumber before landing at Changi. 

I didn't avail myself of the bed as it is basically impossible for me to sleep - I just snooze.

We then had a connecting daylight flight to Hong Kong once again in business class. Like the flight before it, it was faultless with superb service. 

A few weeks later we flew from Bangkok to Singapore and then Singapore to Melbourne a few days later. Once again all the flights were memorable for their professional service. The only down side for us was the flight to Melbourne which left Changi at 10.45 am. As soon as the seat belt signs were off the four other people in the forward business cabin all pulled their beds out and shut down their windows resulting in the small cabin being plunged into darkness.

The planning that went into a daylight back home was completely lost so we may as well have taken an overnight flight instead. "
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"14 July,",,"I recently traveled between Melbourne, Australia, and Singapore with Singapore airlines with my wife and 7 month old daughter in an Airbus A380.  Everything went perfectly.

I was quite anxious to be flying with a 7 month old baby but we were given bassinet seats all the way and the baby slept very well.  The kindness and consideration shown to us by the stewardess's made an enormous difference and I am so grateful to them for making it such a good trip.     

The A380 is a beautiful plane to fly in.  The take off feels more like a gentle lift than other aircraft that I have experienced and the turbulence is not so noticeable."
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"28 February,",,"I purchased 2 economy class tickets from Singapore to Paris in February for a flight in July. I wanted to upgrade to business class with my miles. Upgrading one leg only comes at the full fare of 374,000 miles (!) for the 2 passengers and the two cheaper fares are unavailable 6 months in advance. The call center said all was booked and the waiting list for cheaper fares is already closed. I have come across this problem numerous times. I fly 250,000 miles a year with SIA. In 4 cases out of 5, the upgrade is impossible, even being a Gold Member for many years and being 5 times over the Gold membership threshold. Krysflyer loyalty program is deceiving and does not give any kind of consideration to very frequent flyers. I have given feedback on their Facebook page and their website and they don't even bother to give me any answer. I also had in the past 2 months 2 seat selections moved unilaterally and without warning by SIA from aisle to middle and discovered it when boarding the plane. All these issues show in my opinion a lack of respect to the client and a serious degradation of SIA's service quality"
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"06 October,",,"We flew back from London to Singapore in premium economy.  We had previously flown on our outward leg 5 months before, from Singapore to Rome in premium economy as well.  I hate the seats in premium economy.  They are boring and uncomfortable.  The foot rest is a terrible design and not really thought out properly.  I could not get any sleep on the outward journey 5 months ago and was hoping it to be better on the return.  Not the case unfortunately.  The seat is still horrible.  The food is nothing special either but as always the crew are brilliant. On our second leg , Singapore to Sydney in economy the seat was a much more comfortable design. It was still just a sardine can, but much more comfortable than the premium economy seat. I do like Singapore Airlines but will not be flying with them again in premium economy. "
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"21 July,",,"Because of dietary issues I contacted Singapore Airlines months in advance of my flight to request to be assigned a Child's Meal as I had found from previous trips that the simplicity of the Child's Meal was most suitable to my needs. My request was denied by Singapore Airlines because I was an adult. No other reason. I escalated my request but each and every time my request was denied. Of both the Low Sodium and Low Fat options I ended up selecting, each and every meal was fish which by my return flights was frustrating due to the repetitiveness and that I'm not a big fish fan. Not a big deal most people would say however during my flights back to Australia I became ill because I could barely eat any of the food. One flight didn't even have any fresh fruit available. Singapore Airlines have subsequently advised that in future I can have the Child's Meal but I won't be taking that chance after being repeatedly denied on both my outgoing and incoming flights to Australia. The lack of flexibility with the meals and the lack of imagination in the meals has turned me off. "
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"18 November,",,"Business MEL to PVG; check-in and lounge were great as always, though the aircraft(s) getting a bit old compared to other airlines. Food was ok for business, not exceptional though. Flight to SIN was delayed and no support to reach connecting flight at Changi Airport was offered. Had to take shuttle bus and run to just sneak onto flight to PVG - older type A330 again. Luggage didn't make it to Shanghai: lost and found - handled by some Chinese CSA guys was rude very unfriendly - got 700 RMB in cash, that's it. Was on a business trip without suit and personal stuff and no one from Singapore Airline to talk to. With the connection in Singapore and arrival experience in Shanghai I am disappointed, considering this was a Business Class flight (9k AUD return). Not a bad airline but it feels they had better days. "
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"10 March,",,SFO to HKG TO SIN flight was well staffed and service was very good. 
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"25 April,",,"Staff appeared to be in a rush but took nearly three hours to get a meal on a flight from Singapore to Brisbane. They ran out of chicken, which was obviously popular, half way through serving economy, so didn't have dinner. Breakfast was not much better. Haven't flown with Singapore Airlines for many years and wont fly with them again. Malaysian Airlines and Qantas are far better."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"26 April,",,"Hot towels pre-departure and before landing.  Brilliant.  
Menus - excellent
Socks and toothbrush on long night flight and quality blanket.  Very good
Amenities supplied in loos and constant cleaning.  Very, very good.
Staff   kind, caring and very pleasant - both sectors.  And immaculately presented. 
Movies, delightfully surprised at quality.
Two criticisms, poor quality earplugs, entertainment.  Hot dish ex Melbourne, surprisingly poor and average ex Singapore.
I will not be flying Malaysian again.  Please keep up the good work."
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,Matt Hoch,"20 January,",,"Honestly Singapore most over rated airline I've ever. Seats don't lie straight in business class, no PJs (unlike United), don't let you into their top tier lounge despite 16 hours for US$9K ONE WAY, and pilot booted a fellow pax for saying she would rather fly United.  So bad."
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,David LEWIN,"20 December,",,Excellent service on board by all staff who addressed me by name
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"10 November,",,"I am a star alliance gold member for the last 4 years and regular traveler on this sector ( 15-20 time last 12 months). Recently from the 1 Nov Singapore airlines has decided to replace the regular A330 service with a older much worse 777-200ER service. Singapore to Brisbane a a popular route I am surprised they would use such old dated cabin in this aircraft 

my main concern is the poor qaulity entertainment screen, also the poor meal service now converted to a brunch and every poor standard, better meal served on budget airlines. also there was no pre-drinks service before the meals.

I hope they review this and revert back to regular A330 service.     "
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"18 October,",,Travelled with Singapore Airlines both 2014 and 2015. Perth Singapore Zurich - London Singapore Perth. Or experience was generally good.  One issue that surprised was a completely broken seat that we were allocated on the Singapore Perth leg on a 777.  Busted on terms of recline ands operation . Reported this to the General Manager Australia. Response back was ambivalent 
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"15 February,",,"I flew on SQ 468 from Sin to Cmb on 13 Feb 2016 returning from New Zealand. One of the female cabin crew (in blue dress), a young girl in my section was requested by me for a copy of the Readers Digest magazine on boarding. She stated that she would get me the copy later. When drinks were being served, I asked for a specific drink from the same stewardess who promised to fetch same later. When meals were being cleared I reminded her about the drink for which again she said would fetch later. This was overheard by the senior flight stewardess (in red dress) who intervened, apologized for the delay and immediately got me the drink requested. Later on I reminded the young stewardess about the Readers Digest magazine for which she surprised me by LYING that the periodical was not available on board. When the senior stewardess passed me the next time I requested the magazine from her which she promptly delivered. I would have reported this matter to the senior staff if not for the short duration of the flight. 
This young stewardess is not suited to serve in such an international award winning airline. Surprised that SQ has recruited such a person/ not given her proper training."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"21 June,",,Love the new business class. we flew on PER LHR and return ZRH PER and it was by far the best airline experience 5 stars all around
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,Trevor Thomson,"19 June,",,"Flew  Singapore Airlines A350 premium economy.  Melbourne to Singapore 
Our seats were in the front row of premium economy. 
There were no amenities kits but we were provided with headphones plus a blanket and a pillow which were removed by cabin staff  prior to take off and not returned.
The seats in our row looked like business class seats from about thirty years ago and were completely worn out and broken.
My inflight entertainment control was wedged into the arm rest and the seat did not recline. The cabin staff made me feel it was my fault the seats did not work.  All the seats in our row were faulty. 
Dinner was provided about 2 AM. However I already had a â€œnumb Bumâ€ by this time
Cabin service started in the rear of the aircraft and worked their way forward. Premium Economy were served last 
The meal appeared to be left overs from economy. 
I chose the beef, it came with a bread roll that was hard and dry, the beef chewy. Desert was a brown â€œPaddle Pop â€œflavoured iceâ€ 
Book the cook did not work.

Breakfast consisted of a glass of water."
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"19 May,",,"I was disappointed with this business class trip. The flight attendants were not interested in their job and not attentive. 
 They were actively discouraging passengers to order food. Definitely deteriorated since my last Singapore AL trip which was economy and very good "
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"31 July,",,I flew Perth to Singapore then onto Bangkok return on a 777.
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"17 June,",,"I have been flying to Ho Chi Minh from Sydney and Brisbane return since 2003 and have no complaints with anything, service, food, inflight entertainment and seating all very good in my opinion. They are the best airline in the world, I have never had any complaints in the 10 years that I have flying with them. Once they missed a connection in Singapore but they asked me if I had to be in Ho Chi Minh that day which I didn't so they put me up overnight in Singapore in an excellent hotel, provided transport to and from the airport and all other expenses except drinks. I have travelled in just about all of their aircraft including A380, 777, A330, 747. A great airline. I use to fly QANTAS but SIA leaves them for dead."
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"06 August,",,"Flew Singapore  from Perth - Singapore - Ho Chi Minh and Return (Economy). Outward leg could best be described as average,the aircraft was an A330 seating was hard and uncomfortable, food inflight meals pretty average the old Singapore airlines standard has long gone. The return trip was a horror particularly the Singapore -Perth leg, the cabin was plunged in to darkness after takeoff only to be illuminated an hour later for breakfast at 0200hrs. Who eats noodles and stale chicken at 2.00am. I was asleep but was woken by cabin staff for the meal. Why?  The lights remained on until about 40 minutes before we started our approach to Perth when it was plunged into darkness again  for about 20 minutes, and the incessant warnings about turbulence and not being able to serve hot beverages. On a night flight i'd like to sleep. "
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"07 July,",,"Part 1 - Flying Brisbane Singapore Munich / Amsterdam Singapore Brisbane on A300-B777-A350-A300. The most disappointed part about the trip was the Business Class seats on the B777 and the A350.  If you slightly recline the seats your legs are up against the seat in front of you and you are unable to stretch them. There is this rediculous design that you can sit sideways in your seat and put your legs up on the bench that forms part of your bed. The seats are so wide that you can't get arm support on both sides. You either have to lean to the right or the left.  When they convert the seat into a bed the seatback is dropped down to form a flat surface. However you can't stretch out. You have to put your legs into a space to the side which means you have to sleep at an angle with your legs bent. If you want to sit up at some stage the bed has to be reconfigured into a seat with the help of a flight attendant. At least on Qantas, Cathay, American and Emirates your seat can be adjusted at any angle between upright and flat. There were no amenity packs as on Qantas. You were handed a pair of slippers, socks and mask but no toiletries although they were available in the toilets. "
Singapore Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"20 April,",,"Flew Premium Economy Singapore to Johannesburg SQ478 on April 14. Very disappointed, not a patch on Air NZ Premium Economy. Service was dreadful, no smiles, didn't seem to care we didn't touch our food which was beyond awful or drink our tea - which was weak to point of undrinkable. Reclining seat in front  crowded you, felt like Economy. Sharing tolilets with economy cabin. Dreading flight home. Not worth extra money. Staff need lesson in being friendly and attentive. As for food, worst I have had on any flight in any cabin. Will not take Singapore Airlines again. "
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"03 January,",,"I travelled on Singapore Airlines, just today (03-01-17). I am eleven years old - and had a great experience on Business Class. I went back to my home country - the U.K., for Christmas, and was flying back Business Class (as I do every time coming back to where I am currently living - in Singapore), to resume normal life. I had a fantastic experience. The staff were amazingly kind and caring. They'd bring food and drinks around (which was amazing), and have a lovely smile, but most of all they helped me when my nose was bleeding. It was 3:00am GMT, and my parents were asleep, so I went up to ask for some tissues, and they looked after me so well, as they gave me some tissues and some warm towels, which I could wipe myself with, as the blood was over my nose and mouth. It went on my bed, so they changed it, and they were very kind as they didn't mind it. Unfourtanley I didn't catch their names but the flight was SQ321. My nose bled again, and they gave me a bag and assisted me again very kindly. I have been on Singapore Airlines before, on both Economy and Business Class, but I have never felt so looked after and had such a good experience! I would highly reccomend this airline."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"29 October,",,"Very disappointed with Singapore Airlines during our recent return trip to and from the UK. Firstly Pre Organised Special Meal was not given on the return trip, and when I enquired Cabin Crew denied the request was received when it had been specifically pre ordered. No alternatives were offered. Also we were not informed Upstairs Economy was not available on the return trip as we specifically booked due to my husbands Physical Disability. Water must have been rationed as we only received half plastic cups when we requested, particularly overnight. Have flown many thousand of miles with Singapore Airlines and we are very disappointed. Now looking at other Airlines for our next international trip.
EDITORS COMMENT: oh half glasses of water are very annoying - fill it up I say so we don't have to keep asking for it. "

Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"06 March,",,"I took a flight from India to Singapore then back to Australia, during the flight my headphone jack in my seat stopped working completely, leaving me with no entertainment for the rest of the flight. And then the flight attendants forgot to serve me breakfast while they were serving everyone else breakfast; I was expecting someone to come back with mine but they never did. Extremely frustrated with the service and would never consider flying with them again."
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"30 November,",,"We recently flew from Brisbane to Singapore on a Boeing 777 Sing to HK A380 return to Sing A380 and Sing to Brisbane ( A330) . BNE to Sing flight wasn't great as crew weren't particularly friendly one hostess quite curt actually, the pasta dish was almost inedible but breakfast was fine. Seats comfy and plenty of leg room for us. The entertainment system was poor - static interfering with movies throughout flight . The A380 return Sing - HK was awesome - quiet plane, excellent food and service was fantastic. The pilots were very good at making smooth landings unlike our previous Emerites A380 experiences. Return home Sing - BNE on A330 was good, food was fine as was the entertainment screen quality. I found the A330 a little loud but we were behind the wings so maybe that's why.  "
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"08 December,",,"I was on the first Manchester to Houston non stop on the 30th October 2016. Everything about it was excellent. The staff, the food , the comfort all 10/10. The landing was the smoothest Ive ever experienced. Thank you. Im a nervous flyer. "
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"07 September,",,"Singapore to Brisbane in Business Class. After having flown Economy on Singapore Airlines, I was expecting better than I received. Dreadful breakfast with tepid coffee. Good airport lounge, but Singapore Airlines seems to do Economy better than Business Class"
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"29 July,",,the worst food ever had in my life.
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,Thomas Reprich,"26 July,",,"From the moment we got to the check-in gate to the farewell wishes on disembarkation it felt like we had travelled back in time to the golden days of air travel â€“ this is what it was all about.

Amiable staff on the ground and in the air, a spotless, spacious and tidy cabin all made for a flight that was most enjoyable from start to finish. I will definitely spend a few dollars more to fly AQ in the future."
Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"23 June,",,"Sq235 singapore to brisbane

Business class experience not much better than australian domestic business. Plane interior fitout at the bottom end vs the competition . Seats uncomfotable, dont lay flat. Plane needs pensioning off. Staff on this flight in business were unfriendly and abrupt. Several times i experienced them pushing their way into my space to do something instead of waiting a moment. They were clearly more interested in doing tasks than their customers experience. If i have the choice in future for this leg i will choose other options. Much better offerrings available. Definitely gone downhill since my last flight and this leg flight attendants worse than the trip Brisbane to Singapore (same plane facilities though)"
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"20 June,",,Singapore airlines couldn't of been better. We flew from Perth to Singapore Time 5 h and 25 mins. The five hour ride was a pleasure with no problems at all. The boeing 777-200 LR was an amazing plane. No turbulence was received and credit to the pilots for that. The takeoff was smooth and that was the same as the landing. I didn't have to wait to board on or off the plane. Singapore Airlines gave me no delays what so ever and i was very very happy about that. 
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,Michael Riz,"06 January,",,"The airline lost one of my luggage and damaged the other luggage. They offered me very small compensation.

Singapore Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"26 June,",,"I am a regular flier, (200,000km so far this year) and fly in SE Asia a lot. I used to hold Singapore Airlines up as a yardstick for the others but have noticed that their standards have dropped considerably recently. I fly business for work and economy for leisure and standards in both classes have slipped. SQ are still one of the better airlines but need to pick up their game for that statement to remain true. The equipment is good, Changi excellent (though getting way too expensive) but the in flight service and attitude of many crews leaves plenty to be desired."
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"26 May,",,"Today 26th May 2014. We go to Singapore by Singapore Airline SQ 931. Myself, my father (disable person with no legs on both sides) and my mother.
Onseat 47.

We went to the boarding ticket counter. We asked for front row seat (no. 31) for my father.
The person in charge said that all front seats booked for all babies. Not allowed for disable persons. Because have basins in front of front row seats that use for babies.
""Yoy must contact your travel agent"" as she said to us.

I just realized when we boarded inside the plane the reality was ""that not all babies seat on the front seats.""

I am really surprised that Singapore Airline not happy to bring disable person inside their aircraft.
Maybe next will be better if they announce ""Disable person please don't hope to get front seats' or 'not allowed for disable person to go with Singapore airline'. 
And this plane has been booked for all babies.

So we can noticed before we buy a Singapore Airline ticket.

There was also an old lady around 80-90 years old that put seated far behind me.

Singapore airline, 
Why not allocate at least 2 seats front row for disable persons.
A few years ago, your airline was very famous by your hospitality. Now all gone...

Thank you.

Best Regards,

Mr. David"

Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"19 January,",,"Perth-Singapore, Hong Kong-Singapore-Perth A330
As you would expect from SIA great service all the way, my flight from Hong Kong was delayed so to enable me to catch the connecting flight from Singapore to Perth I was put on an earlier flight, they could not apologise enough for the change, even handing me free meal tickets.
The only slight down fall would be the entertainment system, so far Emirates has by far the best."
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,,"16 February,",,"It is such a shame that the service of cabin staff so significantly differs from the appalling, rude and detached service of their Sydney check in staff. Not only do they enforce a bizarre 50kg weight policy in first, but the manner in which this is enforced is executed is disgraceful. Singapore airlines HQ should send their customer service training staff to Sydney for an urgent boot camp."
Singapore Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"04 May,",,"we are a frequent flyer and so far the best service we have got, just one area they needs to improve is helping parents in their journey. the rest was incredible. we invited our parents from india to Australia 3-4  times, we have requested for help as they dont know english, the help provided to them was best. Over all, good value for money and great experience so far."
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"25 September,",,"would not recommend Singapore Airlines.  Delayed flights, staff not available and uncomfortable.  Dirty toilets.   Customer service is a non-existent and slow.  NOT recommended... don't use if there is an alternative."
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"14 April,",,"DISGRACEFUL TREATMENT!

I am disgusted that there was absolutely NO compassion shown in regards to wavering a post-phonment fee for my Mother and I on our tickets to a later date of travel due to my brother-in-law having three seizures and being diagnosed with an aggressive tumor and having to be operated on immediately. Instead we were shunted from pillar to post between Singapore airlines and BYO jet with no resolve at all. A ticket that cost us $800 was now going to cost us $1400 to change. UNBELIEVABLE! I will for sure tell as many people as I can about this experience. Singapore has just become our least favourite airline!"
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"07 December,",,"Flew from LHW-SINGAPORE, exceptional! Very professional, arrived on time and felt safe the whole way through. Economy class felt like First class, tv was very entertaining with modern music, loads of films and tv programmes and control of our seats (lighting). Arrived at Marina Bay Sands as expected! FLY with the best airline in the world! 
EDITORS COMMENT: We wouldn't expect anything less from this airline. "
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"01 June,",,"I have previously rated SA very highly, but their service in this instance has plummeted. Prior to purchasing my return ticket, I rang SA to inquire about the Gold member additional baggage allowance, knowing that my outward trip was as KrisFlyer Gold and that the Gold Membership would expire whilst I was overseas.  I was informed by SA that since the return ticked was being purchased while I was a Gold Member, then the baggage allowance increase (an extra 20 Kg) would apply for both directions regardless of the fact that the card would expire.  Seem fair and logical enough to me!  I was flying with a heavy tool box and my suitcase so it was very important to know I could get everything (about 40Kg) back home again. 
Well, now it's time to go home, SA have changed their mind and tell me I only have a 30Kg limit, and it will cost me 45 GBP /Kilo to fly the excess 10Kg home again. 450GBP! I must have had 5 return calls now from Singapore now saying ""I'm sorry Mr ..""  Seemingly, it appears that SA have no staff with any authority to give me back 20Kg allowance or add 10Kg to get me home with my stuff. The solution would cost them nothing I would not be here today, as a very KrossFlyer"

Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"14 January,",,"Airline
Is absolutley fantastic
Air hostess went above and beyond for my little son (8 yo) who had a headache. She supplied her own panadol and cold flannles all night. She even worked out the times he should have more. 

She came looking for us at the airport  and when she found us she wished us best of luck, gave my son some panadol, and told us she hopes it gets better 

Airline is also fantastic, good planes and good service.

EDITORS COMMENT: Thanks for sharing your positive experience "
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"22 March,",,I flew with Singapore airline first week of march from Sydney-Singapore_Cochin  and back..very good experience . The ground staff were awesome. Especially at Cochin ..you guys are wonderful (Mr.SAMITH SURESH & ALL)...Thanks guys..But few cabin Crews were not up to the mark.. May lot of people were  in the flight :) 
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,"Singapore airlines are targeting Indians for little quantities of excess baggage. This is racist behaviour from the side of the airlines,  if a white person checks in with the same amount of excess baggage they will easily put it through without any question"
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"26 February,",,"Their service is very poor!!! Don't be fooled with the good reviews or you will regret in the end! Yes, their aircraft is nice but that's what it is all about! Staff should go back to customer service 101. And by the way, their company policy is all about them and not caring for customer's benefits at all!!! Selfish company I must say! I will definitely go back flying with Emirates from now on! If I know someone in BBC I would definitely with no hesitations share my worst nightmare with Singapore Air in international telly so everyone will know!!! "
Singapore Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"15 December,",,"Had my first experience on SQ11(A380).. The seat belt was quite short for chubby person like me, compare to other SQ it seems more shorter length.. Foldable table wasn't clean up and stains all over, most disgusting is stains on the cup holder. No air-con throughout the 7hrs plus flight from Tokyo back to SG, Hot like nobody business! Food wise was kinda disappointed also, bread was really hard like stone. Worse case is that we haven even finish the food (as they serve real late compare to those ""special order"") they started to collect back all food tray. Is this the standard SQ is having? Are they trying to rush us to finish off the late serve? Was really disappointed in SQ as i thought they would be in good standard.. :("
Singapore Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"23 January,",,"Feel Cheated and disappointed with rude and unprofessional customer service received from on ground staff at Adelaide airport.Always traveled with Singapore airlines and recommended to my friends and family but not anymore. I was charged  AUD483.31for extra baggage at check-in and on my asking for the reason for charging this huge amount staff could not provide me with satisfactory answers.  Further to my disappointment, received an email reply from Singapore airlines customer service department to justify the amount charge and just a sorry for rude staff's unprofessional dealing with customers. Never ever going to travel with this airline again in future. Stuck, this time, thought would have pleasant travel and instead of considering any other airlines with cheap airfare as compare to, Singapore airlines would be better but it all turns out to be, was a BIG MISTAKE.
ON GROUND RUDE STAFF AND UNPROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE. "
Singapore Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"25 October,",,"I was flying with Singapore airlines ZUR-SIN (airbus a380) and SIN-SYD (boeing 777).
Very good service, staff most kind, spacious economy class, food as expected...i can say it's one of the best airlines.
Entertainment is excellent (tv-series, movies, music, games...you can find everything on airline's website). If you're hungry during the flight they'll give you more food. Fresh hot towels before meal, coffee, tea, juices, beer, wine...everything you want.
I'd like to give a compliment to Fazila F. and Tang Yew M. on the first flight and Alvin W. and Ruth A. on the second. As I said very professional and kind service which I'm not used to it at the other airlines.
Strongly recommend Singapore Airlines. I'd say Rolls Royce in the sky :)"
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"27 July,",,"Flew with Singapore Airlines from Frankfurt to Brisbane. Overall it was a poor experience as the interior of the plane was very tired e.g. earphone plugs and entertainment screen not working properly, seats were uncomfortable.  I expected much more for the comparatively high price."
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,Sterling Roszel,"23 March,",,"As I look around the plane there are at most fifteen passengers on this flight.  There are more attendant than there are passengers.
1.  Cabins are clean
2.  Lavatories (look closely on the ground, I took pictures) are incredibly dirty around the edges - quite gross.
3.  Meals are inconsistent.  First meal was fish and the fish smelled bad.   I mentioned this to the attendant and before she returned I found a gray hair in the pasta portion.  Quite disgusting.  I was offered a $75 voucher to a discontinued (or not currently available) shopping experience.  Replacement meal was excellent.   Breakfast was SOOOOO over-salted I couldn't eat it.  Only the steamed veggies.,  I figured the fact that I left it out when I went to the bathroom would indicate to them there was something wrong - again.  I was told I was not eligible for a meal this second time around.  Instead I was offered a bag of peanuts."
Singapore Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"16 February,",,"I travelled from Perth to Singapore the seat comfort was VG, the food was excellent and the staff were excellent on this flight.
The flight from Singapore to London the flat bed seat was excellent, the food was VG based on an average if the evening meal and a breakfast meal. The staff were excellent.  The return flight from London to Singapore the flat bed seat was excellent, the food was VG however the staff member i had on this flight was not she tripped and dropped the breakfast all over me, she then advised me she needed to serve all of her customers BEFORE she could clean the mess off me.
I cleaned the scrambled egg and mushrooms off my clothing and hand bag and the seat. When she returned about 5 minutes later she was going to just take the plate away i had to fold up the soiled table cloth and put it on top of the plate to make her clean up she cleaned a little from the floor and left me to sit for 2 hours in a messy seat.  The flight attendant did apologise but her apology gave the impression of right that is all i need to do.  I would have liked the seat and floor cleaned for the remainder of the flight it was gross.   When i contacted Singapore Air they advised they could not find any report on the incident and they crew could not recall any customers having their breakfast thrown over them.  How convenient.  Not what i expected from this airline.  "
Singapore Airlines,2-Oct,Jeff P,"11 October,",,"Zero stars.
Very disappointed with Singapore air. Not so much due to in flight issues, but from a customer service/policy standpoint.
I had hundreds of thousands of air miles banked with the airline. These are miles I accumulated by spending hard earned money to receive.
One day I logged on to use the miles and they were gone. I called Singapore and they told me that the miles had expired. I did NOT receive a warnings about this and when the issue was looked into, I was simply told - sorry no miles anymore.  
This is really  an insult. If you bank miles for future use with an airline, what gives them the ok to simply zero them out???  
I will never fly with them again and I have pulled my company account as well.  I advise that you choose them wisely and look around for alternative travel."
Singapore Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"23 September,",,"Flew form Cape Town (South Africa) to Phuket via Singapore and again from Bangkok via Singapore to Cape Town. Aircraft departures and arrivals on time or somewhat early. Staff friendly as can be expected. Aircraft on most legs were old and rattle boxes, seating very uncomfortable in economy class. Sound systems at times poor to bad. The stop- over in Singapore, however, was very pleasant and was the only thing that ""saved"" the entire experience from rated as ""Very Bad"". I presume that South Africa, being part of Africa, is rated as ""third world"" and therefore does not merit the use of newer aircraft on the long travel legs (14 hours Cape Town to Singapore). In comparison Qatar uses the new Dreamliner on its Doha/Cape Town leg and therefore they fly this route every day and not three times a week as is the case with Singapore Airlines.  Emirates three flights a day from Cape Town! Question is what do Qatar and Emirates do to attract passengers that Singapore does not do? In my book it is not so much the special flight packages that are offered but the aircraft that is being used."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"06 April,",,"I flew from Sydney to Christchurch New Zealand and it was the best plane/airline/crew/food/entertainment experience ever. The A380 is by far the most quiet plane, it doesn't even feel like you are flying. Great experience, it's the Best!"
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"20 June,",,"Economy CHC-SYD on 777ER middle seat. Awful experience, no arm room at all. The aisles are very narrow so the person on the aisle cannot easily give you the shared armrest and the middle two seats of the four seats are left nudging passengers on each side. The legroom might be fine, ICE is good and the meal is good but the seat had me basically sitting sideways and badly uncomfortable. For a longhaul flight I couldn't think of a worse airline seat than that - sardines have more room I reckon. I would sacrifice all the other things for a decent seat. Never again on Emirates 777."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"04 December,",,"We had 4 flights by Emirates: from Moscow to Seychelles via Dubai. From Dubai to Seychelles flight delayed for 2,5 hours (18 November 2013). On backward the same situation from Dubai to Moscow (3 December 2013) - 2,5 hours delayed. For this reason, we missed the next flight. 50 % of delayed not too much?  "
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"13 April,",,"I was happy to think I was to fly in Emirates, but it turned out to be the last airline that could make you Happy. 
1. Water served after 5 hours and Meals served after 6 hours.
2. Kids only, given bread only after 2 hours. No water served, when asked...ignored.
3. Inattentive crew.
4. Cold tea served after main meal.
5. Emirates, your services do not make me Say, it was a nice time.
6. Any other Airline, never been that poor.  Next flight, never Emirates.
7. As the saying goes, big shop but zero quality.

I had a lot of respect for your airline, thought it was a good brand. What a terrible thought that messed up the whole journey."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"03 March,",,"I love this airline. Flew with them for th 1st time feom Brussels to Bangkok with a stop in Dubai. The planes are high quality, big tv screen, delicious food and menu to choose from. We were seated in the middle so no window view but the cool thing is that in the front row in the middle is a huge screen where u can see the view outside in the front of the plane. They show this camera during take off and landing so u dont miss anything! I love it. We had enough leg space. The entertaiment was super, a lot of new movies and so many other choices! U cant get bored which is very convenient on a long flight. I would definetly recommend Emirates. The only minus was the layover of 3h in Dubai. The airport was boring and the only Burger King is so busy ure easily 30min in line and then comes the search for a seat. "
Emirates,2-Oct,ar,"04 June,",,"Highly disrespectful  staff and costumer service. The airline randomly canceled a Flight that I had booked 7 months in advance and I had to repurchase my connecting flights. Spend countless hours with them over the phone and received nonsense explanations, no flexibility  whatsoever. When trying to speak to supervisors at the Dubai airport for arranging hotels, visa,  and extra expenses they asked me to just send a feedback email to their website which I had alredy done and it takes them a week to reply. The staff at the emirates office in Dubai was extremely disrespectful and not willing to help at all. NASTASKIYA SAMUEL and AMINICA  from the emirates help desk in Dubai told me that I needed to  learn how to read in a very rude manner. Never flying with this airline again, very unreliable and unnaceptable customer service. "
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"04 January,",,Flew from Melbourne to Auckland. No choice of meal.Rude cabin staff.
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"01 May,",,"Emirates aircraft, inflight crew and service is very good. However, their 'Customer Affairs' branch is a blight on the airline as they appear unwilling to acknowledge their wrongdoing and responsibility when things go wrong. Emirates lost our luggage on both the outward leg and return leg of our recent journey, resulting in considerable delay, inconvenience and expense for us.  Though supplied with all details and receipts, Customer Affairs have flatly refused to compensate. Whether it is Emirates policy or not, it appears that  'Customer Affairs' functions to ignore and deflect passenger problems rather than take responsibility and mediate a solution.  We have found their behaviour to be quite unethical.  On this basis, we would not recommend Emirates over most other airlines."
Emirates,3-Oct,ar,"12 November,",,"Had the misfortune of flying Emirates 8 times since July. The service is so poor and inconsistent, I don't think the cabin crew understand the meaning of customer service. One wonders if the staff get any training at all. I will never fly Emirates again, it's just not worth it."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"02 April,",,"Flew Sydney to Auckland in January 2017 with the wife for a break and received upgrade to business, so things were already looking great. Didn't get lounge access though, but beggars can't be choosers. Emirates' A380 business class is stunning when compared to Dash-8 and 737 aeroplanes we are used to. Service was great, food exceptional for travel options, ample amenities that were very tidy. The seating and complimentary this&that brilliant, including steady stream of drinks. Bar at rear of cabin super chic, but very useful. Coming home, paid the extra to have business upgrade again, but again told no access to lounge upon arrival at airport, which was certainly disappointing considering it was not mentioned when paying for the upgrade. Flight was late in boarding, so deeper pang of regret at not getting lounge access. But beggars can't be choosers, so we gave the bar a workout and arrived back in Sydney quite merry. Cabin supervisor was also particularly awesome and even allowed a quick look at first class after other passengers had left. Reminds me of the saying 'If you want great customer service, start by being a great customer'. Top stuff."
Emirates,3-Oct,ar,"06 January,",,"Flew Cape Town to Dubai then Dubai to Perth. Cape Town to Dubai was the worst flight ever. Lack of service, rudeness from cabin crew, uncomfortable seating dreadful food. Will not fly with them again"
Emirates,3-Oct,,"08 May,",,"I""ve used Emirates several times between Istanbul and Bangkok and decided never to fly again. Only good thing about this airline is comparably cheaper prices. Main problem in the cabin is the seat layout, which is 3-4-3 seat on each row. That means the corridors are thin and the cabin is filled more passengers. It makes you feel claustrophobic. As there are more passengers inside the cabin compared to other airlines, the number of flight attendee is not enough to for providing satisfactory care. One annoying thing about their entertainment system is that you have to watch several commercials before the movies or any other videos. In conclusion i recommend to avoid this airline, pay little more and choose other airlines for better flight experience."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"04 November,",,Great service and very attentive staff. Especially love the bar area as it allows you to break the long hours stuck in your seat. 
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"11 May,",,"Emirates airlines is notorious for its bad customer service. When you fly business class, you get beyond pampered and catered to, but try having a complaint - it rolls off their backs with barely a shrug. I flew the new service from Auckland to Dubai, and it was a hellish 16 hours of blocked toilets. Emirates is also the only Business Class I know of that has middle seats. And before you think I'm just a spoiled whiner, I have flown Economy class in Emirates and was appalled by the noticeable drop in serving standards (courses get skipped, no coffee for you) My latest gripe is their automated systems when using your Skywards Rewards - the system demands a PO Box Number off you, even if you don't have one! You can't enter in ""NA"" or ""0"", and they NEVER reply to emails...I wonder if my reward will ever get sent to me?"
Emirates,9-Oct,,"21 December,",,Good service and easy to check in online with only a small delay in our transit flight. The passenger comfort and seating area are good for economy seats and the good price. The flight hostesses are understanding and helpful. Food selection can be very good or mediocre and at most times it having a good taste and freshness.
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"01 August,",,"I have been using Emirates for the past 12 years and have always been happy. Unfortunate my last trip was a nightmare.  Our  flight from Jhb to Dubai was late, my tv was giving problems, the staff was not unfriendly and on arrival in Dubai we were kept waiting before being allowed into the airport. By the time we got through we missed our connecting flight. We were put on a later flight, which also left late. On arrival at London Heathrow, it was a nightmare trying to locate my luggage. I was being sent from one baggage claim area to the next. I am sorry that I need to get on to another Emirates flight in order to get back to South Africa.  "

Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"07 May,",,"I flew last September Perth to Dubai and onwards to Rome. The flight from Perth was performed by 777-200. This aircraft is not known for comfort nor leg room.

Never again.  I'll go via Singapore to Europe."

We had a delayed inbound flight from MNL to DXB connecting to DUS. The plane estimated landing was 7:15 (catching up one hour of a 2:40h depature delay from MNL)  and the scheduled depature to DUS was 8:30. Nobody was picking us up at the arrival in DXB. The flight attendands weren't willing to help with the short connection. But the worst thing was that we still arrived at the gate when the Passengers gateways were on the plane and they were still loading the plane. This was at 8:36. However, the Gate was ""closed"" and the Emirates staff was not willing to contact the supervisor (we were checked in, had seats assigned etc. already) The flight eventually departed 9:35, one hour margin! 
We had to sleep in the crapiest Hotel ever and did not get our suitcases as it was promised by Emirates! 
Now I am here one day later at the gate again waiting fro EK055 to DUS. This time the flight is

On my out ward journey drinks were not very forthcoming on long haul it is very important to keep Hydrated. What has happen to the service on Emirates flights for the Economy passenger? Your service is not what it was.
Emirates,5-Oct,,"10 June,",,"I recently traveled from IAD (Washington Dulles International Airport) to DEL (New Delhi, India) through DXB (Dubai). Everything looked fine until I reached Dubai Airport (DXB) before gate. My luggage was weighed by Emirates staff (One cabin bag and a laptop bag) and I was passed through. At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn't carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn't check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her immediately Mr. Mohamed (Seemed their Supervisor) came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and started taking to the other side, saying "" let me see now, get him deported"". took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said no it is heavier. I opened the bag and showed that there was nothing in the bag except the laptop. but he was acting really rude and was ignoring what I was showing him on ticket documents. he said your other bag is also heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that.I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It was just that he was trying to harass me. He was being extremely rude and said he will make sure that my flight is missed. I was really in trauma while dealing with him as it seemed that he was trying that my flight is missed. As I was in a different country I was really afraid. He was not allowing me to go. It looked like that other emirates staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior. One of the staff member who had weighed my luggage earlier and allowed slowly told me that I could complain online about him. I tried to ask his name but I was told that they couldn't tell his name. which later I saw on him uniform that his name was Mohammed. Finally I requested him to let me go and I will pay the amount whatever additional they charge. I felt it like a ransom. After a lot of request and paying the amount he allowed me and told the staff to still check in my luggage and didn't allow in the flight. I was really depressed after this incident and I was scared about my return flight if somehow this person is there again he may put me in trouble again. He shouldn't have behaved like this. I was surprised why these kind of criminal mentality people are serving in such a service field. I will never take Emirates in future for me and my family, I have also told my friends about this incident and have suggested to not to use Emirates for flights touching Dubai."

Emirates,5-Oct,Krista Maglen,"01 April,",,"I just returned from a trip from Melbourne to Lisbon on Emirates. 
On my flight there, I was given a heated sandwich in a cardboard and plastic package. I took the sandwich out and after eating some of it, saw a small cockoach scurrying around  in the box. I was utterly disgusted and freaked out. I immediately showed a flight attendant who passed it on to the flight supervisor. She took a photo and wrote a report and encouraged me to do the same. I was offered a packet of chips as a replacement .
When I got to lisbon I wrote a complaint. I finally received a response from customer service over 2 weeks later just when I was leaving Lisbon. The response was, join our frequent flyer program and we will give you 20000 points (around $200 value) to use on a future flight.
Not only was I disgusted to be served a cockroach but I am shocked and insulted that Emirates see this as an opportunity to recruit a new FF and only offer compensation that requires me to spend $$$$$ with them."
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"30 March,",,"The Emirates canceled a flight and changed our tickets without our permission. When we called their local agent, no one replied. Then I emailed them with full details but no reply. Finally I had no choice to call their Dubai 009714214444 with my roaming phone and after long time waiting they didn't accept to adjust the flight per our needs and didn't care that the changes was their fault. The Emirates Flight considered us as their slave rather that passenger. Anyway, I decided to write this review to let the people know that they may lose all their plans. I guess they are not reliable Air Line any more when they cannot fulfill their promises."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"20 March,",,"Words can not begin to describe how fantastic my service was during both my flights over this weekend ( EK 379 & EK778) Seats 32A & 32 B - Seats 35 D & 35 E. My sister & I had a horrible encounter with Food Poisoning in Phuket which only presented itself on our flight to Dubai. Two amazing ladies, 1 from France & the flight Supervisor from Thailand was absolutely amazing and made us feel so comfortable and handled this horrible situation with such poise. We are so grateful to these two lovely ladies who took such great care of us and arranged an ambulance when we landed in Dubai. The Doctors were truly helpful and lovely and managed to supress our pain and discomfort. Our next flight was back home to CPT and this wonderful gentlemen introduced himself and placed us at the top of his priority list by ensuring that we were always kept hydrated and even arranged our meals before the scheduled time. Although we felt much better He still checked up on us several times during our flight. This TEAM is 5 Star & there is a reason why I will always choose Emirates as my Number 1 choice. Thank-you so much to those SUPERSTARS - You deserve a Bonus!"
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"12 October,",,I flew with Emirates in September on the A380 to Singapore. I flew in business class and I was completely amazed as it was my first time in business class. It was only a 7 hour flight but it went really quick. The food was really nice and dessert etc. The in flight entertainment was excellent. Beds were comfortable. They even gave me a mattress to use when I went to sleep. They had a bar which had a bit of variety. They made me feel comfortable and the crew were completely making you feel welcome. I've been on Emirates before and loved the flight. But that was all in economy. It was still an enjoyable flight. Thankyou Emirates for making me have an enjoyable flight. Defienetely recommend it. I'll be back flying with Emirates. Great work. It was a very good experience being on the A380 as its a big plane with great engineering.
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"26 March,",,"Perth to DUBAI to Manchester. 25/02/15. 3am. I am a diabetic.
At check-in, I had a rare ""hypo"", so rare it was not until later I realised I was having one. The gentleman at the desk was brilliant, did all he could for me, and told me to wait at the boarding gate for him when I felt able to. He then came & got me, and had my boarding pass checked, and got me on the plane as one of the first. He also notified the Emirates desk at DUBAI to look out for me. I have told customer service about him and had a nice reply.
Go back 4 1/2 years. A stewardess was standing next to me, when a bottle fell out of the overhead locker and hit me on the arm. She immediately got me an ice pack, which I had on my arm for 2 hours, it was that painful. The promised complaints form from her AND the chief steward never materialised. After we got home I emailed customer services with my complaint & gave ALL the details, but according to them, on questioning the crew, NO ONE could remember anything about it!
The service on both outward & return flights this January/February, was sporadic at best. I had to wait half an hour for a drink, and that's when I did get one, whilst others just kept getting drinks on request! "

Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"10 December,",,"We travelled on a 1 month old 777-300ER from Frankfurt to Dubai. The aeroplane was very nice and had that new aeroplane smell. The staff in Frankfurt were very friendly and even accepted us at check-in, even when it was closed. (We arrived late due to traffic on the highway from Stuttgart to Frankfurt). The crew gave us hot towels prior to take-off, which I found very peculiar especially in the economy cabin. The crew were not very accommodating and friendly though. I asked for a coffee and they blurted out, ""Coffee?!?"" They rolled their eyes and came back 15 minutes later.... What kind of service is this? The attitude and manners of the crew was appalling! For a so-called state of the art airline that everyone keeps on talking positively about, this is not acceptable. Food was tasty and filling , which I always expect on any medium-haul flight. The seat recline angle and space (width) was exceptional. The seat entertainment was amazing with an extensive range of on-demand movies and games, as well as multiple cameras of the tail and undercarriage of the aircraft. Overall, the flight was fantastic, although I would suggest that Emirates should improve on their cabin crews' manners and service skills. "

YES - U heard it right, for the duty free shopping done at dubai airport - we had to pay 120 USD as excess fee. The entire shopping was not even costing 100 USD.

Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"16 December,",,"I fly once a year to Europe from Perth and in the past I always flew with Qantas which would arrive at London Heathrow Airport. This final destination was ok but not ideal for my travel plans. Although Qantas always provided me with a pleasant journey I decided to try Emirates as they landed in Madrid which suited my travel plans much better. From the outset I was extremely satisfied with change over. The flight was cheaper and quicker than my previous flights with Qantas. The service, the seat comfort and food and beverage selection was excellent. I flew in business class and was worth the extra money. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that that included  limousine pick up and drop off service from the airport making the whole experience a pleasant, hassle free journey and a real smooth ride!

What an awful airline with zero customer service! At another point, a man spoke to us and did not even look in our direction let alone make eye contact. Food was average on plane. We still have 3 flights over the next couple of weeks with emirates and I can honestly say I am absolutely dreading all of them."

We have flown many times with Emirates since its inception and have noticed a steady decline over the years. Lodged a compliant with the airline and did not even receive the courtesy of a reply. 
Now looking at other airlines as our preferred future choice."
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"03 November,",,"Booked a multi sector ticket with Emirates to Europe and Middle East. Had 3 different levels of service and product for Economy on the 3 sectors travelled, though the aircraft type was the same. How can you NOT get that right!

Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"16 April,",,"Return flight from Brisbane to Stockholm, via Dubai.
The part of the journey with the new A380 is quite pleasant. The seating is much better.
The old Boing 777 though, is a nightmare, with faulty entertainment gadgets, totally unacceptable seating, no leg room, no room for anything, long queues at the toilets and overall lacking cleanliness
It just feel cheap and neglected.
The food on the whole flight was incredibly bad, the worst food I have ever been served on any airline.
Staff is undertrained and only when you are lucky you will find someone who is doing his job properly.
shame, because it used to be much better"
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"06 January,",,"November 25th 2015, It was the most terrifying experience i have ever had. The flight from Dubai to Iran was schedule to depart at 16:10, when the aircraft were just about to be pushed to the runway, captain then announced that there were a technical problem have been found, aircraft needs to be pulled beck for  inspection. After waiting on board for 2 hours, the technicians decided that this aircraft was not safe for travel. So we were deported and been arrange for a replacing aircraft.

Now this is where the horrifying tragedy happened. After taking of with the replace aircraft, in an about 1 hour of time. The business class was on Fire!!! Thank God the aircraft landed in one piece, no passanger was injured."
Emirates,2-Oct,ALIREZA Hassani,"06 July,",,"Before the flight, I called the fly Emirates to make sure that all the things were set and the bassinet for the baby is confirming. The fly Emirates customer service told me that the basinet is booked and the baby will have the basinet for sure. I mentioned the age, size, and weight of the baby. 15 min after the takeoff, we asked the bassinet, and the flight hostess refused the bassinet in terrible behavior due to the baby's size and asked us to keep the baby on the lap for more than 12 hours.
So, we kept the baby on our lap for more than 12 hours which emotionally and physically affect us. In addition, we found that our baby stroller is broken. Oh my god. They refuse to compensate. 
So, I am writing to warn you never fly with fly emirates if you have a baby or kid."
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"18 November,",,"LGW-DXB-HKG Business Class. The legs between Gatwick and Dubai were in a 777-300ER and I found the seat to be very cramped for a business class seat (seat 8K).  The food was however very good and the ICE entertainment system was second to none.  The air crew were very helpful and friendly

The leg between Dubai & Hong Kong was on an A380.  It was the most enjoyable flight I have ever taken.  The privacy offered by a business class seat (23K), the comfort of the truly lie flat bed, the entertainment on offer, the food and most of all the cabin crew.  There is only one word to describe it - superb.

From now on, I will always try and travel on the A380.  Boeing really will need to get their act together to compete with this plane"
Emirates,7-Oct,Varghese Mathai,"31 May,",,"Those who are traveling from Kochi to US by Emirates May face issues if you are traveling on work visa like L1, H1B etc. While checking my documents at Emirates checking counter at Kochi, the person at the counter asked for I-797. Looking at the 1-797, he called his supervisor and  he in turn called his supervisor who was an elderly lady in Emirates beige and red dress. It created a total mess for over an hour for nothing.

What I understood from conversations is that in the 1-797 it is written that it is not a valid visa document. I tried to tell them that the visa is stamped on the passport but in vain. I believe the staff and hierarchy of supervisors are not familiar with US visas and types. They probably are good with visa categories to gulf destinations but not definitely to US. I never faced this issue traveling from Delhi or Bangalore or heard of anyone talking about it.

Traveling from Kochi, passengers may have to pay for their non familiarity &amp; incompetence on US visa documents. Otherwise, Emirates is a  good carrier and I travelled with them many times."

Economy cabin is packed like sardine. Only 8 toilets for a whole cabin of 300+ economy passengers. Avoid going toilet after meal. You don't want to know what's in there. And they don't clean the toilet mid-flight, imagine if you have a long flight. Even a 6 hour flight to Dubai is enough"

Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"17 August,",,"Hi, we travel from Syddey to Bangkok and return on the 4rth of August and 12th of August 2014. Flights were: EK 419 - EK 418.

Our experience was very bad and we will never travel with them again. Here is why:

We booked this flight in February from the travel agent, and I explained I needed a window seat due to a medical condition. They said I had them booked, I rang the agency again one month before flying and they called emirates to confirm again my seats. We arrive at Sydney airport 2 hours and 15 minutes prior departure, there were two people free and they were talking and we had to force our way into the checkin. She gives us out tickets, I ask if they were the seats I prenooked, and with poor manners she told us: ' you better go that counter cause you are not even sitting together!' We go to the help counter and they said that the seats were not guaranteed and they give us 2 seats just in the mid raw. Shocking. Then we go on board and we see that the right side was getting menus. I asked for a menu 3 times, I never got it and no one was able to tell me what was on the menu, at least! Very bad customer service. The seats were very narrow and uncomfortable, the crew was rude. Horrible airline. Used to be much better. "
Emirates,8-Oct,Tony Stark,"13 June,",,"My preferred airline most of the time. I actually use whatever gap I catch. In general, the in-flight was good and the other passengers were very respectful. Frankly, I was a bit overwhelmed on the plane, but this is not about the airline, of course. Overall it was a good and enjoyable trip."
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"11 February,",,"Traveled between MAN-DBX-SYD and would have to say the standard has seriously dropped. The leg between MAN-DBX was disappointing for my wife as her entertainment system did not work. After an hour of trying to get a cabin staff to to look at it then another hour of resetting they gave up asking my wife to move seat away from the family. The cabin staff were slow and seemed to spend all their time in the galley. They wouldn't answer the call button requiring  you to get up and ask the at the galley for drinks.
The flight from DBX-SYD was no better. The seats we were allocated were right at the back of the plane and the overhead was full of airline products (crew blankets), why on an aircraft the size of a A-380 they have to use passenger space.  We were delayed in departing by 1.5 hrs and during that time they would not let you use the toilet or bring requests for water. 
During the flight the crew did not respond to the call button requiring you to get out of you seat again only to see that they are sitting around  having a good old chat. Good to see that the paying customer comes first, not. Sears no longer comfortable and the foot rest has been removed. Will consider alternate."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"06 January,",,My favorite airline
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"15 December,",,"Emirates published a companion fare which they promoted heavily with their travel agents. I bought a companion fare ticket which was heavily discounted but what the agent didn't know that the companion fare has a stipulation that all the passengers need to travel together or no one can travel. Due to a personal emergency, I had to cancel one ticket but Emirates wouldn't let me do that. I booked the ticket through the top travel provider in the country and talking to various supervisors, none of them had heard of this absurd ""all or none"" traveling. Emirates categorically told me that a single person cannot travel on the ticket if both people are not traveling. This is a money making scam from the airline!

This is my third worst experience with Emirates flying out of USA. I won't recommend them to anyone!"
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"12 June,",,"Be warned be aware
my family flew to europe from melb in march.  flight from melb was cancelled thus a 24 hr trip became 87 hrs with little care from emirates BUT the big concern is they will not now supply us with evidence the flight was cancelled, will not respond to emails etc from us or the travel agent.  Now waited 45 days and they just send and email saying it will be resolved in 30 days and without this piece of evidence the insurance will not pay out on all of the additional costs etc due to the delay.  . Shocking situation so if you plan to travel with them DO NOT leave the ticket counter if something goes wrong without written emirates evidence of what has happened.  They will not as they assure you provide it later.  Good luck"
Emirates,10-Oct,,"19 January,",,"This flight on in the First Class Cabin from JFK to DXB was a pleasure, on the great Airbus A380. The comfort of the seat was amazing, being that it was like my own little house on a plane, own bar, TV, storage, infinite leg room, and more. The staff was more than friendly and nice, they were there for your every need, and sometimes travelling alone could be lonely, they're there! The food was great and so was everything else. Emirates, great job."
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"19 July,",,"I fly a lot and different airlines. I was told that I should fly on emirates because it was Ramadan and I was fasting and had my kids with me that the flight would be easier. But this trip turned into one of the worse that I have taken EVER. It started out with my daughter asking for water and the crew member came and turned said ok and turned off the light and never came back. An hour lasted she asks for water again and the crew member comes back and said we will be passing out water soon. 25 min they come by with water... Ok... I was fasting because it was Ramadan and when it was time to break my fast they gave us 3 dates and a bottle of water and that was it. When we asked for food they said that it was not time for food?!?! I informed them that I was fasting and they now exactly when it was time to break yet they didn't offer us any food. My daughter went looking for food and came back with an apple. And that's what I ate. It was time to fast again and when i asked for food I was told they will bring the breakfast out shortly. Well it came out about an hour after the time for fasting started. I have never experienced such disregard for a person on a flight before. 

EDITORS COMMENT: When flying in economy you really can't expect food on demand for religious or health reasons. You need to bring your own if you need to eat at a certain time. It's simply not practical to have economy passengers choose when they do and don't want to eat. "
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"03 July,",,"My wife and I travelled on 21 June 2015 via EK775 - Emirates Airlines T-Economy.  I cannot rate the entire flight highly enough.  Everything was of the best standard.  The cabin crew members were of equally this highest calibre.
For instance one of the Senior Stewardess, Alessandra, was incredibly good to all passengers, including my wife and I.  She was unfailingly polite and smiled readily.
Nothing at all was too much for her.  She was extremely efficient.  She is certainly the best stewardess whom I have encountered on very many flights.  I commend her highly to her superiors.

And not only this, now they are asking me to reschedule my flight and pay the fee, seriously! This is why u offer this service, to make money out of it. For me emirates is a big NO NO!"

Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,"I will never again fly with this airline. Two reasons: luggage allowance and in flight service.
1. I will never forget the shock I got when I checked in my luggage. Normally airlines allow one piece of checked in luggage and one carry on when you fly intercontinental, and then they charge you per extra piece of luggage. But no Emirates, these guys allow only 30 kg checked in and 8 kg (1 piece only) carry on, any everything extra is charged 100 USD per kg. Since I also had my backpack, I would only carry on that, and had to check in my two suitcases and one carry on. I had to pay the price of one more flight for for the extra luggage! That is absolutely insane.
2. The flight attendants were some young crowd looking for partying around the world, and they kept talking out loud in the back of the place (I was seated in the back so could hear them the entire time) about how the only reason they took the job with Emirates is to see the world. Apart from serving meals, they rarely passed through the plane to see if passengers needed anything (like water). Very immature service level."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"09 June,",,"My main gripe is about their last-minute ""upgrade to business class"" offers. This is essentially a great idea. Fill the bizclass seat. And I was actually happy to pay the extra $2000. But their stoooopid marketing people chose to exclude not only the chauffeur driver (which could be accepted). But it also said: NO BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE ACCESS. Now am I stupid, or is this one of the main things we pay for when going biz class? Emerites has stuffed up badly here. I have chosen to stay in cattle class if Idon't get my business class lounge access. Bad call Emirates!"

Excellent flight. Good service and no hassle to ask for anything. The IFE was called ICE and it had a wide variety of music, movies, TV and games. The only bad thing was in Frankfurt we couldn't access the Emirates lounge since we had booked with Qantas, but it wasn't a big deal. Would I fly with them again? Of course. "
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"01 December,",,"We flew Emirates from Manchester to Auckland via Dubai, and returned from sydney back to Manchester via Dubai. From the last time we flew with Emirates standards for inflight services have certainly dropped.
On our recent flights the planes were cold and despite having blankets the passengers in our area resorted to wearing coats and hats! The crew were unable to tweak the aircon. No blankets were available from Brisbane to Auckland so we shivered for three hours.
The food quality and choice was terrible. Meaks were cold, of poor quality and on all our flights we didnt receive a meal of choice at anytime. Little point in giving out menus when there are no choices available.
The fritatta and sausage breakfast will go down as the worst ever in flight meal.
The flights ran out of beer and wine and gone are the days of more than one drink round.
The cabin crew seemed to be distracted and disinterested.
What is happening to what we once considered to be the top quality airline."

There's no doubt that every aspect of an Emirates journey is remarkable, right from the moment you check in. As a passenger you are provided with just about everything you could hope for when travelling economy, from friendly service to nifty little extras like ""please wake me for food"" stickers to put on your chair and luxurious hand lotion in the lavatory. The only thing I could ever fault about one of my journeys was when a steward refused to serve me a glass of wine by blatantly ignoring my request at dinner and laughing it off. I called him back and he very awkwardly asked me to show some form of ID that I was over 18 years of age. I am of course, 26 years of age and found this quite embarrassing to be ID'd on an aeroplane with everyone looking at me like I had committed a terrible crime for asking for some wine!"

Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"04 January,",,Flew from JFK - Chennai twice in the last 1.5 months. Food is of good quality. This is an airline owned by the royal family but the flight attendants think they are the royal family!!! Many of the flight attendants are rude and they seem racist to me. They don't serve coffee or alcohol an extra time even when you politely request. I understand its a tough job for them but they could be a bit more pleasant and understand that they are there to serve the customers/passengers. They should learn from the Asian carriers like Singapore air or Cathay Pacific.
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"18 November,",,"EK404, EK003
Having flown Emirates long haul for 6 years now, it's very disappointing to see in the past couple of years their service has declined considerably.  The website has never worked correctly to allow any modifications or upgrades to bookings, and the resulting service from their Customer Contact Centre has been less than welcoming, with their inability to price match the website, despite the website malfunction preventing you from using it.  Service on the phone takes considerable time, with less than polite agents on the other end.

Service at check-in has been varied, with a recent experience of our seat allocation having been changed at the last minute to very poor seats (middle section right at the back of the plane), despite better seats having been allocated well in advance.  Understandably this may need to occur once in a while however there was no apology, empathy or care whatsoever from the staff with rude and abrupt sentences instead.

Service in flight has become some of the worst in flight service I have seen of recent, with staff not attending calls from passengers, with it not unusual to go hours with someone pressing the call button repeatedly and continually being ignored.  There have been several times I would find an attendant to assist, just to have them 'forget' me and requiring to be repeatedly reminded. If you are lucky enough to receive the hot towels at the start of the flight, as often this is left out (seemingly like they are too rushed to worry about it), they will often not get collected.  They are typically on time, but the in flight facilities vary considerably across the fleet, and the service is not standardised, for example the  quality of the on-board facilities varies considerably between planes, and most commonly the headsets require to be changed 2 or 3 times in one long haul journey.  Feedback and complaints from several fellow travelers to Emirates, and including myself, have all fallen on deaf ears with no response from Emirates to feedback via their website, and no ability to follow up or give feedback by any other means.  Would you want to fly with someone who's solution to complaints and feedback is to sweep it under the carpet and it will go away?  I suspect they have fallen into adopting the ""too large to care"" enterprise model.

It is such a shame an airline with such a large useful flight network, and great potential let themselves get to this point of poor quality service over the years.

Ex-frequent flyer of Emirates."
Emirates,7-Oct,,"14 February,",,"Other airlines flying the 777 aircraft long-haul use a 3-3-3 layout, whereas Emirates squeezes an extra seat in (3-4-3).  That makes for a very uncomfortable trip.  I am glad i only to have had to put up with it from Perth to Dubai, we had the A380 for our next leg to New York which was much more comfortable. I would not recommend the emirates 777"

The Cabin Crew was very friendly and helpful and spoke many languages fluent. The seat comfort is great and the inflight-entertainment the best of all. It was truly the best flight I ever had and I will always fly with Emirates from now. (Flew with Lufthansa the same route before and it was horrible). Emirates is really the best Airline in the world before Etihad and Singapore Airlines. I can really recommend flying with Emirates."

When my doctor said the recovery and treatment takes time and need to cancel my travel then I canceled my tickets. Unfortunately not only I payed fine to Emirate but also I payed fine to the agency as well almost $900 that I could pay a portion of my cancer medication.

Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"18 April,",,"I traveled with my 20 month daughter from Egypt to USA with a transit in Dubai. I have encountered a lot of problems during my trip.
1) In Egypt, the Emirates personnel took my stroller and refused to give me a claim ticket. He threatened me that if I waited for a claim that I might miss the flight. He promised that they will deliver the stroller at New York, which didn't happen. At NY, they told me that the stroller was never shipped and they have no clue about it.
2) In the flight from Cairo to Dubai, the flight attendants have brought me a bassinet (previously reserved and confirmed), but they refused to allow my daughter to sit in. They claim that my daughter's weight is more than what the bassinet can sustain. They didn't ask my daughter's weight neither they told me their bassinet's specifications.
3) In the flight from Dubai to NY, the flight attendants refused even to bring me the bassinet. They forced me to carry my daughter for 14 hours. They have even refused that I rest her on the ground for a few minutes, threatening me that this might affect the plane's stability. The supervisor was very rude. 
4) After I have arrived, I found out that the bassinet can sustain 22 pounds, while my daughter is 20 pounds. I made a complaint and their response was not apologizing at all."
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"05 May,",,"We travelled from Dubai to Sydney on 380 a fews days ago.  The leg room were better than Qantas, but the recliner were too tight, not moving much.  I had a terrible experience on my way back home.  We sat in the front section of Economy section.  There were 3 kids accompanied by 2 Middle Eastern Women.  Two of them screamed and carried on all the way for over 14 hours flight.  The assumed mother failed to discipline her children.  One of the kids, approximately 2-4 years old boy, constantly poking silly face at me, turing his body and touching my tv screen through the gap of seats.  The most of bizarre and rude things were spiting at me.  Because I ignored his inappropriate behavior for a few hours as I didn't want to lower myself to his level.  Instead disciplining her child, the assumed niece questioning about my action.  In order to get a few hours peace, I requested to be removed to a spare seat in the back row.
The 2 females failed to comply with the directions when directed to close the window blinds and restraining the kids on the seat complying with safety regulations, constantly arguing and shouting at the air-hostess, including the team leader.
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  

EDITORS COMMENT: Can't really blame the airline for fellow passengers - they have about as much control as you do. Passengers like this deserve to be blacklisted - just as a drunk person causing havoc on a flight would be-  it's just not fair. "
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"10 August,",,"I am appalled beyond belief  by the lack of information provided by check in staff in Madrid and the incompetence of their  Dubai transfer desk staff. I have been humiliated and treated like a criminal for being in possession of an e- cigarette in my carry on luggage. Apparently the rules for personal possession allowed in Dubai has changed since the 1 st of July and I started my trip on 22 June. Emirates made no mention of this at all. Neither the mobile app or the website mentions this change. All my e- cigarette equipment worth in excess of $ 500 has been confiscated by Dubai airport staff. I spend hours during my transfer time between the MAD - DBX and my connecting flight DBX - PER at the airport talking to police, customs and  ground staff to find an amicable solution to this appalling disrespect of peoples personal belongings. Customs blamed police, police blamed Emirates and nobody took any responsibility or sensible action. Although it is beyond my comprehension that e- cigarettes, containing on toxic chemicals or producing smoke harmful to others are banned at Dubai airport while real tobacco products are actively promoted for duty free purchase and smoking areas"

Things like limo leaving airport in Prague before we exited the baggage section! One leg coming back was a tired 12 year old 777 with clunky entertainment system and papers and mags untidily stuffed in holder at seat front. Had to carry down  cabin baggage joining in Stockholm due to broken escalator and leaving in Dubai, no air bridge!!  Also no ground staff to help FC and BC passengers at either airport.  So much for BC cost of fares. Dubai lounge crowded. Emirates have lost the magic. Will be using different company next time."

Yogurt and fruit must be added to meals instead of desserts., especially with many people avoiding desserts. Very often a particular food choice runs out! I saw this happening on several flights. Passengers should be able to get some yogurt if requested.  The bathrooms in the economy can be cleaned more often.
Overall Emirates staff seem courteous.  I feel safe flying Emirates!"

Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"17 January,",,"Well when you fly with emirates, everything looks glamorous.. until when there is a crisis, and all hell breaks loose, passengers are treated like dirt, no back up plans in cases when flights are delayed on long haul, suddenly all rouge faces start lying about how all the hotels in Dubai are full. It doesn't matter whether your flying business class or no, you are all just goods to be transported when there is a crisis at the emirates airport."
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"17 March,",,"Extremely poor customer service during our travel from San Francisco to Hyderabad on Feb 22, 2014 (we are emirates frequent flyer members travelling with one year old infant).  Following was our experience after 5hr flight delay in SFO and 15hr flight delays in Dubai:
1.  Single passengers were rebooked and handed boarding passes at the arrival gate while we were asked to go stand in the customer service line for close to 2hrs to get our re-bookings.
2.  Refused to help us find accommodation even though we were willing pay for it ourselves.  Customer service was willing to help but needed authorization from Travel desk, who flatly refused for procedural/technical reasons that they couldn't explain.
3.  Didn't provide bassinet facility or assign us a row with extra seat in-spite of multiple requests at the gate and with the air-hostess upon boarding the flight (flight probably had 20-30 vacant seats).  They kept telling us to wait for the doors to close before they can help while other passengers freely moved around occupied non-assigned seating to stretch themselves.  We ended up flying with our baby in the lap (after 36hrs of journey with no sleep).

I may have flown more than 1/2 a million miles in my professional career and this is by far the worst experience.  In summary, my wife and I decided we will stick with a more mature airline such as Singapore Airlines for our future travel !!"

Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"21 November,",,"The flight to D.C to Dubai was good. We stayed in Dubai for 5 days and next flight is from Dubai to Bangkok. All my seats were confirmed. When we checked in at Dubai airport, I was told I was on stand by because I did not check in online. Hey, checking in online is an optional for all customers. I was traveling with a child and I also have a connection flight from Bangkok to Yangon. I was at first check in counter for 20 minutes and was told that the flight was overbooked and I will know 30 minutes before the departure( if I will get on the flight on not). She sent me out to the other counter but that lady had no idea. Again, I was sent out to the ANOTHER counter. By the time, I got to the last counter, I barely hold my anger. After heated arguments, I got the seat but I was put in the middle seat. I chose my seat one month before my trip and they all were confirmed.When I showed my print out my electronic ticket, they said I lost my seats because I did not check in online. Really?? They treated me like a fool and 3 staffs ganging up on me. It took almost 2 hrs at the check in counter. Crews were rude too. I heard they make fun of Economy class passengers.  NEVER AGAIN, EMIRATES!!"
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"06 December,",,"777-300ER, Christchurch to Sydney, Business Class, seat 8K (assigned at check-in).
Previously travelled Emirates on this route a couple of times QF codeshare. First two times economy, first time satisfactory due to window seat and spare seat in middle - good service, good meal for economy. Only complaint was to ask for more wine was met with ""I'll get that for you later"" and when much later it arrived it was white, not red!
Second time much worse, seated in middle, one in from aisle. Middle is a 4 seat squash and while knee and leg room are good for economy, the width is a problem for broad shouldered Europeans. I had to sit slightly sideways to fit and hated the flight.
So to my latest business class flight - this is the way to fly with Emirates I think. For me now a couple of times business class has been terrific. Space is good (some note the width is less than other airlines in 777 due to 2-3-2 layout for Emirates but I think its fine). The seat appears to go if not horizontal then almost. Service is super. Once I am in business class I can sense the cabin staff are trained to greet by name and serve you. I am pleasant and thankful and this seems to go a long way towards making the experience the best - I really think it helps to make friends with the cabin staff here - they appreciate it and respond. Wine and food flows. The menu is very good. The cheese board is beautifully presented and amongst the best on all airlines. I didn't get the luxury chocolates - I went to sleep instead!
So to seat 8K (or 8A). These two window seats, at least, at the front of the second business class sub-cabin, seem to be semi-isolated by a forward projecting centre console between the seats, which houses the entertainment screen for seat 8I (or 8C). It means one has to enter the 8K  (or 8A) seat facing sideways but once in the space it is half way to a first class cell! Yes I liked it. One slight issue is the screen for 8K (or 8A) is on the partition in front of you, so a relatively long way away. I also could not find the control for adjusting the brightness on this screen so had to use the default setting and close the window shades to get best vision.
All in all though this seat and the flight aboard this magnificent 777 was thoroughly enjoyable. Would I rather be on an A380 - probably, but this was a terrific experience."
Emirates,9-Oct,Fatima Alzaabi,"26 July,",,"The best airline ever. The stuff are nice and chatty, they are welcoming and always smiling, the seats are wide and comfy, and you can't feel tiered in the airplane you have entertainment and snaks from time to time, also you can walk around and move your body a little, and the airplane is clean. Dubai airport is a whole city in an airport. The only problem is we pay a lot but still the check-in takes a lot of time. They should fix this."

The terrible customer service started even before we got on the plane, which was at the counter to get our boarding passes. The lady at the counter was EXTREMELY rude and disrespectful to both me and my family. She kept rolling her eyes at a question we asked or just glared at us in the most disgusted way. I honestly wish i had her name so i could go back and complain and yell at her. She even changed our seats which we had booked prior to the flight, and we didnt realize until a day later. Absolutely horrible and disgusting. for the price you pay for this flight, i wouldnt say any of it was worth it. I would take Japan airlines or any airlines over this anyday. We flew from JFK to Dubai. "
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"05 January,",,"2 people, Flight from Sydney to Frankfurt via Dubai. First Leg was on an A380. On checkin, the guy behind the counter gave us the seats next to the emergency exit - what a value (2 Meters leg room and only 2 Seats) (PRO TIP: Smile at the check-in and be polite, even it is 4am). Flight was comfortable, the entertainment system is awesome, internet for 1$ per 500MB. The crew was attentive and helpful. The food was good and in the back of the plane is a self-service bar with drinks and snacks.

We arrived a bit late in Dubai, so Emirates staff picked up all ppl (~10) for frankfort and got us all in front of the line at the security checks. 

Dubai -> Frankfort took place in a 777. Well, really lame experience after a smooth A380 ride - but not bad anyway.Entertainment System is a bit older, the screen are not that big and no internet. Seats were a bit ""worn out"". But we had a 2-seat row in the back of the plane. Service again attentive and helpful."

My daughter booked with Emirates as she thought it was good customer service - how wrong can you be. She paid a lot for her ticket and then misread the baggage allowance. Their web site is very badly designed and unclear. At the airport the check in staff were rude and dismissive and completely unsympathetic to a genuine mistake and also to genuine distress. My daughter was so upset at having to literally put half her belongings in the bin. The Emirates staff were smirking and totally uncaring. They also wanted to completely rip her off by charging an extortionate Â£600 for an extra bag!  Avoid this heartless and disgraceful airline at all costs - they truly do not care and will take as much money from you as they can. Terrible service. It also took me over an hour to submit a complaint as the form ""doesn't work"" very well - obstructive and extortionate. Never again"

Economy: The economy cabin is great for it's price. The TV resolution is fine and the sound is good too. There are lots of restrooms so you don't need to line up for long.
Business & First: The business & first class cabins are absolutely breathtaking. The seats are very comfy and the staff is happy to help. The champagne served at the start is a nice luxurious touch. The restrooms are spacious and in first class it's great.

It has been 'escalated/prioritised' multiple times with no effect.  Where is my money Emirates???  They do not care.  Avoid this airline."
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"13 September,",,"Not a high quality experience. I travelled business class to Dubai from Gatwick. The plane was delayed by 3 hours, and the screens were changed to reflect that. Then the screen suddenly changed to last call, everyone rushed there to be told that it is not boarding and not there responsibility. 

On board the flight my seat area had not been cleaned or replenished, when I pointed out the open empty cans and the half drunk water I was told bad luck. Within the dinner service I asked for a coffee, it never came, 2 hours later I asked again and the hostess said oh yes I forgot. It arrived 45 minutes after this. 

I then travelled economy to Adelaide and the experience is no better. I have taken the time to reflect on this experience before writing this review, but as I am currently buying flights to and from Australia I thought now was the time to save someone the inconvenience.

This is the poorest long haul airline I have travelled with, and I certainly will not be traveling with them again."
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"28 March,",,"We flew business class to and from Auckland. Everything was perfect from checkin staff, cabin crew, the amazing A380, but, I ungraded our flights from economy to business class and because I had bought a discounted economy fare and then paid $660.00 upgrade each way for the two of us but at checkin we were told we were not allowed to use the emirates lounge. We went on this short flight to see what emirates was like as we are planing a trip to Europe march 2018. I just don't understand why they didn't allow us the use the lounge so we could get the overall affect of business class. To be honest we were very disappointed with that because when I upgraded there was not mention that we couldn't use the lounge. Guess I'll just have to do my research when I book our business class seats to Europe wether it be emirates or another airline. "

Good service all the way on these routes, but minor things like my menu choice on Ams-Dubai leg ran out. First Class (I upgraded Dubai-Brisbane) was superb and really great service from the cabin crew. One minor thing - my entertainment unit onboard had to be reset, but other than that, the flight arrangements, the experience, etc on an 11-day trip across several continents and cities was made that much better."

The cabin crew were quite professional. The same cannot be said about the ground staff at BOM and DXB, most of whom think they have won a lottery and that everyone is their slave. I had ordered and was served the Asian Vegetarian meal on all four legs, but was shocked to see the bad quality of the food. It is surprising a Dubai based airline can't get Indian food right. The transit at DXB was ok. It is a well maintained airport with a good choice of food and shopping. Emirates flights are quite notorious for their delays, particularly if the departure from Dubai is in the mornings or afternoons. So I would advice anyone making connections to be wary of this. I will recommend this airline for no reason other than their low fares."

The problem with this is that we were scheduled to arrive in Rome at 07h25 in the morning after a short 3 hour layover in Dubai but now they were making us arrive at 20h20 in the evening after a 16 hour layover in Dubai!!

I have called Emirates countless times today and wasted my entire day trying to get an earlier flight and they say there is nothing they can do.

We are only going for 5 days so to lose an entire day, have a 16 hour layover and lose out on all the tours we had planned is just unacceptable. 

Very disappointing. This is the last time I will be flying Emirates."

Dubai airport is the best airport I have ever been to."
Emirates,2-Oct,Luca Schianchi,"18 July,",,"My last trip with Emirates was deeply disappointing, raising concerns about their commitment to customer satisfaction and safety. I encountered several issues that left me deeply dissatisfied and frustrated.
Firstly, I received misleading information from three representatives about their cancellation policy. They assured me I could get a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours but failed to mention it applied only after 7 days. Attempting to cancel, I could only reschedule, resulting in a $500 loss. Despite Emirates acknowledging their mistake, they refused a price match or refund and eventually even stopped responding to my messages.
During the flight, we saw blankets piled in front of emergency exits to save time, compromising passenger safety during an evacuation.
Emirates declined to reimburse me for damaged luggage, reflecting a lack of care for passengers' belongings.
The return flight experienced an extensive delay due to a missing document, leaving us seated for over two hours without updates or assistance.
The stark contrast between Business and Economy class experiences is disheartening.
In conclusion, my trip with Emirates fell totally short of my expectations. Misleading policies, unresponsiveness, safety concerns, and inadequate customer care paint a very negative picture."
Emirates,4-Oct,Michael Sherman,"01 January,",,"I recently flew Emirates Airline but was totally disappointed with the overall service in Economy class. I am sure they may be a better choice for First or Business class but if you are travelling economy, I may think twice. My family and I have finally decided to strike them off the list of good carriers. Be very careful when it comes to baggage policy is extremely greedy. They even check your baggage weight while you are about to board the flight and make it extremely painful for an excited or travel exhausted customer. They are ruthless when it comes to deal with customers with baggage. Food in economy class is at times stale and often tasteless. The room for each seat in the economy class is no less than a crammed local train with so less space between seats. If they take out one column of seat I am sure it will let people breath. Booking policies are way too strict. DO NOT FORGET to read between lines when it comes to making any change. Over all I would rate Emirates as lower B class flights if not C. I would certainly downgrade it 3.5/10 (10 being the best)."

The rules said that they will accommodate those travelers whose connections are +6 hours. So, we went to the customer service and asked for it. The lady was so rude and it looked liked they are not being taught to behave like a customer service (at least be polite to people). She said that you had to reserve the accommodation before your flight. Although it was written no where on the ticket confirmation, she insisted that you had to check all of our website which takes at least 10 hours of web surfing (she probably assumed that I have no job to do and there is enough time to check the whole website!). Then she said if you want a hotel room right now, you should pay for it. We asked about the fees then she refused to answer initially. She said I have to see your passports (!!) before I give you the quote. That was totally weird!! When she saw that we have Iranian passports she said $250 (seriously?! I can book a five star hotel in the US with that money!!), without looking inside. So, she quoted us based on our nationality. This is called discrimination that I have not seen anywhere else"

Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"24 March,",,"As of this week (march 2017), an internal announcement to GR1s and FG1s has come out to advise they are to lose their single accommodation and be moved to sharing. This is the way they reward loyal, long standing service. No focus on employees because they think they're going to recruit new people easily buy what they don't realise is that the fresh blood have no interest in representing the values of the company or providing first class service. Customer satisfaction is already lower than previous years and will continue to decline, especially once they realise how badly staff are being treated. Emirates need to reward loyalty, not punish. Goal posts constantly changing... and not in a good way. Shame on you. "

Pressed the button to get a glass of water/wine for 3 times to get the attention. After being asked what I like to drink, then again waited 15min without receiving anything. Then again asking to get a wine, then waiting 10min again. Unacceptable. Such request would be handled within 5min with most other airlines. The staff totally did not care if you asked for anything. Big disappointment. Also the food was really poor. Same for flight from CPH to Dubai just few hours before (connecting flight). Poor food on EK152 from CPH to Dubai on Nov 2, although the service was much better on that leg. Dubai to Bangkok leg: You really must check who did work on that shift. Totally poor customer service! Additional: Inflight entertainment seem so nice at first glance. Large TV etc. But the actual contents of movies is rather poor. Did not find anything interesting to watch at all."

We had more than 10 hours delay on a flight to Bangalore. Absolutely no help or service in Dubai, only a few dry rolls. On the way back they forgot pre-booked dietary special meal.

Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"14 June,",,"Recently returned from a trip to South Africa for safari. realized upon arrival at outfitter that Emirates had damaged my luggage. This is a 1750 Pelican rifle case, the same model the military uses, and upon inspection, one of the rifles was damaged. damage to anything stored in this style case was purposeful as it takes a great deal of force to do so. With no ability for contact where i was, I made contact with emirates within 7 days of arriving home, within their 7 day policy. i was told that because I did not contact emirates within 7 days of arriving in Africa, during my 10 day hunt in the bush with no way to contact emirates, they are not r4sponsible. furthermore, they did not deny they damaged the luggage, just that they are no longer responsible.

Furthermore, the flight home was delayed because 1 passenger needed to debopard in Tambo. that delay put us in Dubai 30 minutes late, still 1 hour before our connecting flight took off. We were stopped at the gate by emirates personnel and told they were"" calling in our boarding passes"". that took a few minutes and we were finally escorted to the departing gate. We were then told, ""sorry, gates closed"" We were not allowed to board"

When we go to the airport in Vietnam to return to Australia and we gave the check-in officer the documents for the boarding passes. It turned out that our flight had been cancelled and we could not board for returning to Australia. We tried to contact Emirates customers service but no luck. We have to rebook the Hotel as the flight schedule due to be at night. At the Hotel we contacted Bestjet.com agency to sort it out and it took 4 or 5 hours to get the respond from them. The agent had confirmed that our flight had been confirmed and they did not know the reason why we were refused boarding. It was very very frustrated and stressed.  Finally, they re-book our plan to travel back to Australia on the next day. Our daughter had been admitted to hospital because of their fault. No compensation or opplogy from them. very bad airline.

It was the night before new year.He already booked us to an awful hotel without our confirmation!They also mentioned that Emirates has lowered quality(hence price) due to the new management from Indians and Philippine.They even advised us not to fly with Emirates.

We ended up burning our 1 night in Sri Lanka.When I complaint,Emirates sent an automatic email saying we used the ticket and no refund.I asked them to pay the cost of our burnt night due to their delayed flight and misleading staff.They do not even read emails.I have never seen a company whose staff is ready to screw its own employer and so careless.

Yes, the plane was new and it was full. The entertaining system was very good indeed. But that was about all. The food and service were below expectations and well below many Asian airlines.

Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"05 February,",,"Worst flying experience!
We took the flight from Hong Kong to Dubai- and it literally is the 'sardine class' in economy with Emirates. They put so much focus on their elite first class people that the economy is just squished together with no comfort at all. The seats cannot fit people comfortably because they are small and narrow & the person next to you & infront of you, is basically on you.
The food was cold indian masala chicken which was way too spicey (I'm indian). The online experience in booking was shady- they say 'techinical difficulties' on their site for flights that are full now giving you the impression that the flight for that price is available. The price online vs phoning is different & their staff isn't helpful in telling you if certain seats are free before you purchase- this is a must if you have babies flying with you & you want that more legroom in that sardine class. Dubai is great, Emirates is horrible though. Fly something else even if it costs a bit more, because the seat comfort, personal space and traveling with kids ,these are important for the long flight. Take another airline!"

Despite we were told to choose any available seat, my wife was asked to move by a flight attendant to accommodate another young lady.

Knowing the fragility of a guitar it is unacceptable to check it in regardless of all fragile handling protocol an airline may have,A guitar is too sensitive to be checked in. 
Upon arriving at Boston my guitar was nowhere to be found at baggage claim and after filing a claim it reached me a few days later. And when I unzipped my case I noticed my guitar's headstock is fractured and the guitar has received dents on its body which indicate excessive force regardless of emirates ensuring  fragile handling.

Nether got an answer despite the 2 other mails I sent..."
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"22 October,",,"Firstly I launched a complaint on 14th September with Emirates concerning the bad attitude and sloppy handling of the ground staff at the first class terminal in Dubai.Still no response from Emirates. Being a frequent flyer and part of the ""elite"" skywards rewards program I have yet to recieve the treatment I am promised as a Gold memeber, and a reasonable response to my complaints.


Emirates Ground staff in Dubai are rude, unhelpful and are unable to handle compalints adequetly when faced. I waited the required 30 day period and flew with them again due to convinience of the route I required.


However, once again I have had a bad experince. I travelled on the 19th of October from Johannesburg to Dubai, Dubai Athens both with returns. Landing in South Africa this morning.


Other travellers should beware that Emirates is selling buisness class seats as frst class seats.Having payed for a first class ticket, I was very dissapointed to be put in the usual buisness class seat sold as a first class option. In my opinion a waste of money.


I was hopful and then dissappinted after I had an emergency and had to change my flight,I tried to book an emirates complimentary chauffer drive  more than 12 hours in advance and was denied. I was told  the request was unavailable due to no 24hr notice period. Despite this fact the unhelpful Emirates call centre staff just repeated the fact that I hadnt booked in advance, regardless of the fact that I didnt even have 24hrs to give them notice.


I can undestand this circumstance,but fail to understand why I am paying for a first class ticket when I get a seat that is not first class and they cant even assist me with a chauffer drive. Why do they have these frequent flyer programs when the rewards and services promised are not delivered. 


As stated before I have tried to contact Emirates regarding my complaints. I use Emirates frequently due to the fact that I travel to Dubai frequently and the availability of flights into Dubai. I am very dissapointed that everytime I encounter this Airline I have unresolvable issues. I do not look forward to my next encounter with his airline.

However, I witnessed a very different picture then to my expectations. Having flown Qatar airways throughout the years even on a BAHRAIN-DUBAI flight via Doha. I was accustomed to high standards of service.

The service from the crew was a letdown. I asked for a fruit platter and I was told by the crew that they would have to check whether they even have it available. I mean ridiculous that you would not have this to be served to a passenger twice.
Frustrating was the fact that the crew did not even come back to tell me through out the whole flight that they did not have fruit plate available, which I think he assumed I forgot.

Each and every time I requested something I had to typically wait longer then a passenger flying economy. I even did not garner a response from the crew that they were unable to carter to my request or an apology for the same.

The food itself was not upto the exquisite taste we have come to associate with this travel. Obviously I would not know better because I was not able to try another statement dish. "

They had clearly drank too much and acted inappropriately for almost the entire flight. Their seats number 65B and 65C.I asked the ladies politely to reduce the noise they were making as I (and many other passengers) were trying to sleep. They immediately reacted aggresively and started to insult me, my religion, my nationality and at one point physically attacked me by hitting me on back of the head.At this stage i went to get a member of the cabin crew who was sitting, as we were still in landing mode. This particular cabin crew handled the situation as well as she could have, reassured me that the passengers will be dealt with and held on completion of landing. Unfortunately this did not happen and the passengers were simply released as if nothing happened at all!Emirates won't reply or handle the situation after 14-30 days!!! not acceptable!!"
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"14 September,",,I've been one of the most travelling customers of this company for years and my last experiences with this airline have been so unacceptable that I will never ever fly with them anymore. this airline is losing its respect for their customers day by day and since last year in each and every flight I had a very bad experience. from my baggage delay to pay extra expensive charges for extra baggage allowance to losing my flight because of bad connection flight service. I am done with this airline and I will never fly again with them.
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"01 April,",,"Maldives-Colombo; Booked them last minute as China eastern cancelled my flight without notice, after payment was done they mail me telling the flight is 4 hours delayed due to fog in Dubai.... had no choice but to wait, was given a 14 usd food voucher, but Maldives is so expensive that I could only buy a fast food burger... On board plane shabby due to overuse, crew friendly but desperate to take off and get to their hotel! well it was a short flight but I can tell is was superior to most of airlines these days, amenities, good AVOD selection, good food, would fly them again in the future if the price is right."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"18 October,",,"I flew Emirates from Perth (B777)  to Milan (A330) via Dubai and came back to Perth from Istanbul (B777) via Dubai.
Cabin service was very good, meal were of a high quality and substantial, spirits were readily available if you wanted them, entertainment system was good.
Connections in Dubai were awful being 5 hours 45 minutes going to Europe and 9 hours 25 minutes coming home. Emirates advised me that if I wanted a better connection coming home, I would have to make an extra payment for my fully paid ticket and this unexpected long connection was the result of the early bird special deal, my travel agent couldn't do anything about this.

Emirates,2-Oct,ar,"29 August,",,"Hi,

I first traveled with Emirates in March 2015 with my 10 year old son to Dubai. The Business Class service was beyond appalling! The crew strutted around, (the Arab men especially), barely taking orders and being completely inept. They served my son the wrong meal and did nothing to make him feel comfortable. I have traveled Business Class most of my adult life and now that my husband is based in Dubai, (I am based in NYC), I thought it would be easier to fly Emirates. Added to their completely and absolute ineptness on board they ended up losing my luggage on arrival, such that I was left with no clothes for the first 24 hours!

I decided to give them a second chance and this time all 4 of us, (including my 10 year old and 5 year old), flew from NYC to Dubai and on to Bombay in mid August returning 3 days ago. Once again, the service on board was completely disorganized, not helped at all by crew from all over the world, (Eastern Europe and of course the men from the Middle East). On boarding, my  5 year old son's seatbelt had dried food or vomit all over it! I asked the steward to please clean it up, he handed me a warm towel an"
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"05 November,",,"Horrible horrible people. After major surgery I came to Singapore airport after a long stay with 35kg rather than 30 to avoid hand luggage and lifting with my right arm, despite a letter and my explanation a jobsworth refused my extra kilos as did an inhumane supervisor who said she would be fired if she even made an exception for one kilo. The airline preferred me to unpack and carry my kilos, no humanity, no grace, no kindness just frowns. No help to unpack and no offer of sympathy except from a brave trainee. Emirates just lost my business for my return medical trips - worth far more than 5 kg. I am disgusted and do not recommend this airline for people who have been ill."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,Flew Dubai-Brisbane on 4AUG17 in business class. Plane was full with no spare seats but service was good with no undue delays with serving meals or drinks.   Discovered that the socket for the headphones was broken.   Cabin staff made a good attempt to fix it but were unable to do so.  They collected a good selection of magazines from around the aircraft and gave them to me so I had something to read during the flight as there was no spare seat to move me to.  Apart from the entertainment problem overall the service was good with nice food and polite staff.  The senior cabin attendant apologised to me personally for not being able to fix the system and assured me that I would be contacted later by Emirates re the problem.
Emirates,9-Oct,Matt Hoch,"20 January,",,OMG second best airline in the world next to ANA/Qatar.  SO AMAZING. Love how they recruit a passionate crew from around the world who cares about customers.  I would fly them every week if I could! 10 star!
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"28 March,",,"I have just had a wonderful flight from Dubai to London Heathrow.  I would never think about writing a review of an airline but felt I just had to comment on this flight.  The main reason for this review was the Captain on this day.  He was Captain Bob, I BELEIVE his surname was Taylor.  From the word go he kept us informed of what was happening when we were delayed by an hour or more.  Then coming  into London he gave the most wonderful commentary.  Telling us where we were, what we could see and even explained about orbiting.  It was so refreshing to be furnished with so much information.  In fact everyone we spoke to after landing were talking about Captain Bob.  Thank you sir for your explanations and commentary it was great."
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"19 February,",,"I usually fly Emirates now because of the extra leg room in Economy. I flew return Australia to France via Dubai. Outbound flight was delayed due to passenger illness  (unfortunately unavoidable) but we were kept well informed. Meals were really nice. Customer service was great. One of the flights was on a Boeing 777-300ER which was really uncomfortable. Cramped, no elbow room, but unfortunately flight was full so my request to swap seats couldn't be accommodated. Despite this, I will continue to fly Emirates long-haul because the overall comfort level is better than say QANTAS. I also like Emirates' app which shows you the location and status of flights."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"21 June,",,Awesome experience. Just arrived home to Brisbane one EK434 from Dubai. For an economy you would be hard pressed to find a more friendly and professional airline. Their systems are easy to follow. The service i experienced was great. The food and food tray was great no cost cutting here. Very comy seats and great selection of entertainment. Friendly and helpful staff. The A380 seemed new so it was brilliant. Its easy to see why they are the best at what they do.
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"23 May,",,"I recently flew with Emirates from Cape Town to Dubai to Phuket. I was not impressed with the rudeness of the CT-DXB flight. It was as if they are doing you a favour in just bringing you a glass of water. Whilst in flight I pressed the buzzer. 20 minutes later I had to stop an attendant asking him why my calls is not being acknowledged. I requested water. 10 minutes later the water was placed apologetically on my fold out table.I have flown many flights with EMIRATES but this last round trip I found that service have deteriorated a lot. Even the quality of their food has gone for a loop.  Lately the food has become tasteless and cold.

I understand attendants fly long hours but really we sit cramped up for long hours too and pay a lot of money. On the entire flight I spotted 2 crew members that actually smiled. All of them look miserable and had these no care attitudes. It says a lot about the training and handling of staff by a company claiming to be the best airline."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"13 January,",,"Flew Rio-Dubai, 777-300 ER, amazing experience, best airline ever!!"
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"26 May,",,"I just wanted to say how amazing my flight was tonight. I have been wanting to become cabin crew for most my life now and after this flight with emirates I wil be trying my absolute hardest to work for you. Andrew on tonight's flight 26.05.2017 made the flight an amazing experience for me. i will never forget it :) thankyou again Andrew. Hope this will get back to you! It was an such a pleasure to meet you. You did a fantastic job with all your passengers, made them feel so welcomed and you made every single one have a giggle. Such an amazing personality! I will see you hopefully in the near future on one of your flights one day. 
The other cabin crew did such an amazing job aswell, I hope to work for your team soon!!

Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"12 December,",,"Flying Emirates and their ICE system are great - but their customer service is a disaster, seriously. Ignoring a request does not solve the problem. Flying for 11 years with Emirates and then such a disappointment!"
Emirates,3-Oct,Joe Whitehead,"12 June,",,"Emirates is rapidly becoming the worst airline in the world (having once been among the best). I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world, including low cost airlines. Never fly with Emirates."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"16 November,",,"Flew from Brussels to Dubai. Very efficient check in and boarding procedures though full flight. Crew was very friendly and attentive. Food was excellent. IFE also excellent. Enough leg space, but seats were a bit small ( arm space was limited). Early arrival (30 mins) was expected, but due holding in Dubai, we landed 3 minutes early. We were parked on outside position, and bus took 20 mins to terminal. Overall an excellent flight."
Emirates,4-Oct,TF Ko,"07 January,",,"I've been flying Emirates for many years, being their gold member. But based on the latest flight, i am probably not going to fly them again. 
First, i wanted to use hundreds of thousands of miles to upgrade myself and my partner to business class, but was told it was not possible as the route was not open for such upgrades, so ended wasting years of miles collections on few hundreds dollars ""discount"" on economy ticket. 
Emirates used to be amazing with onboard services and refreshments, but every time i fly it is getting worse and worse (or less and less) with lots of items being out of stock (one hour into the flight). 
Check-in experience in dubai in the gold members counter was terrible, unfriendly, unhelpful. We spent good 30 minutes discussing umbrella that came on another emirates flight (still having emirates tag on it) and if the checkin person can accept it to the flight or not. 
Overall, emirates is declining year over year, what once used to be absolutely amazing experience is now almost comparable to low-cost.
The only good thing is their entertainment system (if it works for the seat)."
Emirates,5-Oct,Emmanouil Perakis,"10 January,",,"Emirates Airlines â€“ Nice words, Irresponsible Behaviour

Had checked in on-line for an 11:50 Dubai-Athens flight on Dec 11th. My taxi arrived at 10:40 due to the unusually heavy rain that day. Run to drop off my luggage. An Emirates employee tried to call for about 5 minutes boarding, without ANY reply. Then he refused to put me on the flight. 

What they did wrong:
â€¢ Spend 5 minutes calling boarding, nobody repliedâ€¦..then just said â€˜sorry you are 2 minutes lateâ€™. 
â€¢ Didnâ€™t try to find a solutionâ€¦..repeated like robots â€˜we did everything we couldâ€™.
â€¢ Didnâ€™t even offer a coffee, a ticket, a discountâ€¦instead suggested a wrong flight to go back home on same day.
â€¢ Ignored my need to be on planeâ€¦â€¦didnâ€™t propose to travel without my luggage, even though they knew I could as I had checked in on line.
â€¢ Asked me to file a complaintâ€¦..send back a standardized blah blah reply about timings WITHOUT referring to any of my questions.

Emirates Airlines people surely smile and talk nicely, but when things get serious they really donâ€™t care about their customer, have no empathy, make mistakes and even worse pretend to care. Shiny on the outside, irresponsible on the inside."
Emirates,2-Oct,ar,"10 November,",,"Booked 4 business class tickets for a family with Emirates from Australia. Specifically chose Emirates for high class service - especially as I was buying business class.

Forget the rude counter attendant when checking in - they called me the travel arranger 5 minutes before take off, no hello, no double checking the number they had just dialed, just yelled ""Where are you!!!!"" when I asked who the person on the phone was they replied ""Emirates! Where are you! You're the last one! We're all waiting for you!!!.

Thinking that the family may be late, I urgently called them only to find out they were already on the plane and been on it for some time. 

Apparently Emirates did not enter the details into the system before boarding the plane correctly and therefore thought the passengers had not boarded.

1. Huge security issue if this is the case.
2. There aren't a huge number business class seats to prevent a quick eye count and figure out the issue before calling up a person and yelling at them.
3. I did not pay business class tickets to get this sort of service.


Get your act together.
This will be the last time we fly with Emirates."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"20 June,",,We recently travelled Brisbane-Dubai in a 777 (3 hour layover) and then onto Gatwick again in a 777. The return trip was Heathrow - Dubai in a 380. We were then in a 777  from Dubai-Singapore (1 hour layover) and Singapore-Brisbane. The 'sardine' seating was very uncomfortable in the 777. It is an insult for people to be subjected to this sort of seating for any flight but particularly a 14 hour long haul. The seating in the 380 was heaven compared to the 777 and really enhanced our flying experience.  So our big thumbs down is to the 777 seating 333-4444-333. The food was great and we enjoyed a new cultural experience just through the food. The biggest bouquet must go to the Emirates cabin crew. They were professional and confident but also warm and engaging. Every cabin crew member we spoke to maintained pleasant eye contact even in the midst of balancing food and drinks. The cabin crew made us feel like first class even though we were economy.

Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"17 February,",,"I found poor service on flight EK010 an A380 Airbus from Gatwick to Dubai in that cabin crew were not serving passengers with drinks until 2.5 hours into flight and then it was self service  by a number of passengers. My wife asked for a drink and was told that they would be brought around by crew not the case they were to occupied drinking and gossiping amongst themselves instead of doing the job.

Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"10 March,",,"Emirates claims to be outstanding

Food was lousy and more plastic packaging on the tray than food and no space to put a glas
Poor cleaning of bathroom, little service between meals
Good check in and polite crew"
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"29 August,",,"Had a short leg from HKG -> BKK this month on Emirates business class. 

Compared to all other regional airlines' business class, this one is superb. The seat, service, cleanliness are nothing to complain about. 

Greeted by a nice crew once on board telling me the features on board the A380 and all other amenities was definitely nice to start with. 

With my own minibar, saving efforts on both parties to ask for drinks is another plus.  The bar of course is one of the best features of Emirates. Unlimited free flow of Moet almost made me drunk on board but who cares getting a bit dizzy on a holiday.  Premium lane after landing at Bangkok for instant immigration procedures is definitely another thing to show they do care about their customers. 

One great thing on the trip was that it happens to be my friend's birthday (but he's in economy).. I thought of sending him a glass of champaign but instead the crew members surprised him by taking him up for an instant Polarid on the flight. What a wonderful and unforgettable memory we had. 

One thing to voice out is the food.  Probably Emirates should change the food provider in HK, they were just terribly nasty. "
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"09 April,",,"I didn't have particularly high expectations, but was quite disappointed by the service on this long haul flight (Brisbane to Dubai). Cabin staff were very aloof and not at all friendly. Asked the attendant for a little pillow for this 13 hour flt, she said there were no spares. Left with a meal tray on our laps for nearly an hour. Accidentally left personal items in seat pocket (of no value to anyone else). When I called, Emirates seemed incredulous I thought it may be recoverable. For the price paid for these flights I'd like to be treated a little less like a mob of sheep. "

Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"03 January,",,Flew Perth/Dubai/London a Gatwick on a Qantas ticketed flight in an Emirates plane.  First timer on Emirates and very disappointed with the overall experience.  The best thing for me was the ability to use the Emirates lounge in Dubai - the best ever lounge I have been in!  The crew on the Perth Dubai leg were very unhelpful and when I sought assistance to find an overhead locker I was advised but the attendant he was not a baggage attendant - how bad was that - it set the scene for the whole flight.  Overall a shabby time.
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"21 August,",,"I have just got back from a 3 month honeymoon which my husband had no clothes throughout the duration. Emirates lost our luggage and failed to let us know anything throughout our honeymoon. Luckily, the concierge at our hotel found my bag after 3 days but my husband only received his the day before we flew back. Then, when we landed in Heathrow, Emirates had left my bag behind in Dubai. It was a complete mess from beginnig to end!

Emirates have now offered us Ã‚Â£100 each. That's it. Awful customer service and awful compensation for a trip of a lifetime ruined.

Never fly with Emirates if you can help it."

I made the booking nline via the Emirates website and the ticket included Chauffeur drive bookings. It was a little tricky working out how to manage the Chauffeur bookings on line. On my return trip from Dubai to Perth I think I did something wrong during my online booking and I had no pickup from Hotel to Airport, I rang Emirates and they had a car out to me pronto. "
Emirates,0 / 10,Yus Yoz,"16 March,",,"I booked emirates for the service but they are by far the most terrible airline, they are a budget flight with no understanding of good customer service.
Took a flight (connection via dubai) to Colombo, they delayed and made us run for our next flight and the inconsiderate/incompetent pilots/staff couldnâ€™t even apologise and the useless staff are telling us to hurry up?!!!! Ffs the cheek of these people.
Gets worse, on the way back the incompetent useless beings got us delayed AGAIN!!!! and this time we missed the connecting flight!!!!
So have to wait for the next flight and they give us a rubbish coupon for a free meal to places i dont even eat from!!!! Cheap company, budget airlines!
I will never use them again!"
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"28 November,",,"The Dubai to Perth trip was very uncomfortable. The seat was hard and the recliner mechanism wasn't working. The crew were dejected , unfriendly and at times surly.

Despite advances in avaiation , the room given to Econmy on the A380 is a disgrace....Regards."
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"08 March,",,"I really don't understand what the fuss is all about with Emirates. I recently had the chance to fly Emirates twice and both flights were nothing but average. The food on Emirates was really terrible and the service was not any different than any bad US airlines. In fact the only thing good about Emirates was the newer planes. Aside from that the seats were not comfortable and the flight attendant only served us one meal and came twice with some water and juice in a 8 hour flight form JNB to DBX. Same thing happened on my 8 hour flight from DBX to LHR. Comparing Emirates to Turkish Airlines or Lufthansa or JAL, Emirates definitely in bottom in economy class. Maybe there first class and business is different but economy was terrible. Not enough leg room on the same plane I have taken with a different airlines. The seats were smaller and they have more seats in a row on 777 than Turkish or Lufthansa. Overall they weren't that bad but definitely not even in the top 20. "
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"02 November,",," I took a flight from San Francisco to Bangkok with a stopover in Dubai. The flight from San Francisco to Dubai was a 15 1/2 hour flight with a 6 hour flight from Dubai to Bangkok. The entire flight experience along with the check in experience was amazing. I have heard many good things about flying Emirates but it was even more of a great experience firsthand.  There was more than enough food provided along with drinks, the entertainment was exceptional. They  had an abundance of options due to course of the flight. My next travel is to India and I do expect to be flying emirates on my next international journey.

EDITORS COMMENT: We've been receiving a bit of bad feedback about Emirates of late so its great to hear things seem to be getting back to the old standards again."
Emirates,2-Oct,,"12 February,",,"Don't get fooled once you see an attractive ticket price, as those attractive prices have a dark side in the T&amp;C, especially when you are dealing with a big airline like emirates, so they never solve the problem once it happens, and you start getting bullied by their complaint department. You will definitely be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads, and they have those monsters in their back office! what even make it worst, is that I am a regular customer since 2008 &amp; I am on their skyward mileage reward, with a very good/strong history but still wasn't enough, and they unleashed those complaint team monsters on me :) To cut the story short, I bought a ticket with a stopover in dubai, and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more, so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesn't allow me to stay 1 more day (Max 7 days), and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket! which is nonsense! so I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me! so thats what I call ""Pirates"" attitude, imagine how many people could just pay that penalty without checking or asking for a 1 way ticket! So I submitted a complaint, and simply asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn't make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&amp;C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&amp;C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there's no way out! and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! so They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back. (The funny thing, that when you see their ads and the way they sell their services doesn't reflect any reality, so don't believe those ads you see, as it doesn't reflects the whole picture, there is a hidden dark side) So to summarize the story, don't feel smart when you find a very attractive ticket by emirates as you might end up paying more to go home, plus you will have some disturbing moments when you try to solve this issue with them. Anyway, I only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me, and if you have the time to read the T&amp;C then please do. otherwise you will get bullied by their pirates (complaint department)."

On the other hand, the return journey from Dubai to London Heathrow on an A380 was the best airline experience in my life, ultra spacious, amazing. Would recommend Emirates to anyone. "

London Heathrow abysmal."
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"09 January,",,"I was a gold card holder with Emirates for 5 consecutive years but now I won't use them at all.  In the air they are probably the best airline to fly with, but on the ground their customer services is the worst I have ever experienced.  I resent being lied to by staff and then ignored by customer services when I submitted a complaint. The final straw was when I travelled business class with a long layover, booked on line and told to get my hotel voucher in Dubai. Arrived at midnight with 9 hours before my connection and was told that I was not eligible for a hotel.  I was given several highly unlikely reasons why I was not eligible for the hotel which the Emirates website had told me I was eligible for, including that I should flown at a different time of day to avoid the need for a hotel.  I sat in the lounge for 9 hours and when I complained to customer services they denied that I was given any of the excuses that I was given at the time (I had taken the names of the people I had spoken to) and invented some more equally unlikely ""reasons.""  Emirates customer services never admits any mistake by Emirates.     If you travel on Emirates it will be a pleasant experience if all goes according to plan but don't expect any receptiveness to your situation, an apology much less anything to rectify the issue."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"10 November,",,"one word.. amazing! Emirates is like an addiction, when you start flying with them you don't want anything else. you will never be fully satisfied with other carriers"
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"01 August,",,"I have a mixed opinion about Emirates. 

I fly from JoBurg to various EU destinations. The flight between JoBurg and Dubai is usually terrible. On two recent flights the AC  was set to max power and 10C. Some guys were sitting in full winter clothing. I had  three layers of blankets wrapped around me and over my head. 

I'm a big guy, 190cm and 95 kg. The legroom is OK, I can stretch my legs all the way. The problem is the shoulder space. I fly aisle and every single person who passes by kicks my shoulder/elbow. while the guy sitting next to me is pressing his elbow into my side and his shoulder against mine. Once I had a Chinese guy actually sleeping on my shoulder.
From Dubai to Europe, it is usually better. 

The in-flight service is OK. I walk up to the water dispenser or to the back of the airplane if I need something. 
The food is mediocre. Lately, I skip the food on board.  I have proper dinner in the business lounge and stock soft drinks and snacks for the flight.   

I occasionally get Business class updates for free and the lounges are nice. 

With Emirates, you get exactly what you pay for. "

Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"23 May,",,"After flying on primarily on U S flights for years I thought flying could not be enjoyable. Wrong we flew round trip economy from JFK to Milan in April and the flights were wonderful from start to finish.  Great service, food entertainment and hospitality.  I read other review and am wondering if the reviewers got the airline confused with another,"
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"15 September,",,"In the last month a had four Emirates flights with about 7hrs duration each. In two of those, the first drink was offered more than 90 minutes after take-off. When I asked the staff, they said the drinks come with the meal. I don't understand why you keep the customers waiting for water while the meals are heated. Any other airline provides drinks first and brings the meals later.
On top, there was no free movie choice programm. The entertainment system offered only five movie channels in English, whereof three played the same three action movies in a row. The only movie I wanted to watch started six hours after take-off."
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"11 December,",,"Over the last five years I have been a frequent flyer with Emirates and have flown from Dubai to England, Germany, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and the USA. I fly frequently enough to have reached the Gold level of their horrific frequent flyer scheme, but more on that later.

Firstly, let's look at Value For Money.  Emirates are consistently more expensive than their full service competitors, even in the face of falling oil costs. By contrast, the quality of their service has been in steady decline for the last 4 years.  On my first flights between LGW and DXB in Economy on the Boeing 777 and 777-ER, staff were friendly and attentive, multiple drink services were made during each flight and attendant requests were followed up promptly.  On my first Business Class flight from LGW to DXB I was greeted by name with a glass of Champagne on boarding and looked after beautifully throughout the flight.  Compare to my experiences in the last twelve months: in economy the in flight drinks service on medium haul flight has been cut to once per flight (usually about half an hour after the meal has been served) and staff have become surly, impatient and inattentive. The same is true in Business Class, food service has become sloppy and erratic and drink requests frequently go ignored. On a flight from Cape Town to Dubai in June, my wife and I waited nearly two hours for our main courses to be served after we had received our starters. When the hostess eventually did re-appear to clear our starters, she asked if we were ready for dessert. On another flight I had the audacity to ask for a second glass of wine to accompany my (extremely dry) chicken biryani. I waited for 20 minutes before the hostess returned and confiscated my wine glass. I was not even offered a glass of water for the remainder of the flight and the biryani gave me food poisoning.

Now, let's look at entertainment. The Emirates ICE (Information, Communication, Entertainment) system is generally pretty good, but is inconsistent across the fleet. In 2011 Emirates started to upgrade the ICE hardware in their 777s, but seem to have abandoned this program.  I don't know the exact figures but in the 28 flights I have taken since 2011, I have seen the new hardware 3 times. The equipment is unreliable with video and/or audio frequently failing, and in some cases not working at all. Twice while travelling in Business Class I have arrived at my seat to find the ICE system not working (things like this really ought to be checked pre-flight) and I have had to move to an inferior seat. On another occasion, travelling in Economy, my wife had to ask the Purser 5 times to have her ICE screen reset so that it would work properly. This brings me on the Customer Service...

The Emirates Customer Service scheme is deliberately designed to be as obtuse as possible. Complaints about poor in flight service can no longer be made on board direct to the Purser, instead you are told to send an email to customer.affairs@emirates.com.  If you do this, you will hear nothing for a month before finally receiving a reply telling you that issues with in flight service should be reported directly to the purses and that consequently your complaint has been closed. I have had cause to lodge several complaints with Emirates of the last 5 years, for a variety of reasons; poor in flight service, damaged/missing baggage, unexplained flight delays, poor check in procedures etc... And the outcome is always the same. After making a unilateral decision to close my complaint without my consent, the case is closed and all further correspondence is ignored.  On the one occasion that Emirates did acknowledge that they had done something wrong and offered me compensation, it was on the condition that I sign a document stating that they had not done anything wrong. Essentially,  this is Blackmail.

Finally, the Skywards frequent scheme. Between us my wife and I have several hundred thousand Skywards miles. This is because whenever we try to spend the miles on Flights or Upgrades we are told that we can't. Most of the member benefits of Skywards Gold membership were withdrawn earlier this year and the dedicated checkin area for silver members at DXB is frequently left either understaffed and completely unmanned. So, a frequent flyer scheme that promises a lot, but delivers very little, regardless of membership tier.

All in all, Emirates have stopped trying. When they were a fledgling airline striving for recognition in a global market place they went out of their way to excel. Now that they have achieved the recognition that they wanted, they have given up and are resting in their laurels. Very bad form!!!"

Emirates,5-Oct,Aravind Murarishetty,"28 February,",,"This is WORST FIRST CLASS TRAVEL EXPERIENCE. Airline charged for few inches more despite being half allowed weight. DXB First class lounge staff clueless on hotel availability. Baggage missed at Dubai despite 19 hour transit. No communication on lost baggage so far.
Every step of the travel, I found harassment, terrible customer support, and absolutely NO HELP."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,"The service was very disappointing and we were shocked as this is known as airline where service is what they pride themselves on. I am normally extremely easy to please, and normally write very good and positive reviews, so this is unusual for me. Some legs were great ( Dubai to st Petersburg return) but the longer ones- Sydney to Dubai was below average. And the service once we returned as there were a few issues that needed follow up was incredibly poor. The staff I received emails from was disorganised, rude, unhelpful and like nothing else I have experienced from a customer service agent. One part of Emirates would say and offer one thing when I would hear something contradictory from someone else...and then I got an essentially abusive email as I said I was confused! Sorry Emirates but am less than impressed. "
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"30 December,",,"I ""flew"" Emirates all over the world business and first class (Est 12 flights 2013). Since the introduction of Qantas the whole airline service has gone downhill to a point I am changing airlines. nominal 7 hour waiting times between flights in Dubai, full flights, slim chance of getting window seat, lower ""quality"" of passengers now take Emirates into the 3rd world category in line with there new partners. Good Luck and goodbye."

Great service, good legroom, clean , pleasant. It was delayed but that didnâ€™t effect my short connection. On arrival staff were on the ground and got everyone onto the next flight. I had to make the flight due to the restrictions in Auckland and they had all of that covered. Second leg I flew business class on the 777 -300 ER it was the older business class but it was incredible. The food the service the attention to detail and cleanliness! On such a long flight it was so comfortable. Down side was my iPad controller would require constant charging. I came off the flight feeling human, rested , well fed and more ! Iâ€™m not a fan of emirates usually but wow!"
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"12 January,",,"Gordona Maric helped us and she was very very nice and really good at her job. Anything can go wrong while flying as we all know but if u have a good person that is well trained and willing to help, it makes a world of differences. Keep it up Emirates. "

Service in flight great on all legs - flew Dubai to Manchester on the A380 realy pleased with the aircraft, low noise levels and fantastic entertainment systems on board. Slightly disappointed with the crew on this leg as stood chatting alot while we are left with trays and rubbish waiting to be collected.  
Flew with family and realy great care taken of our daughter although her request to look upstairs was sharply rejected! Seems only family of crew are able to go look upstairs.  Over all good service."
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"05 September,",,"I always fly with Emirates. They provide a great service on most long legs, (melb-Dubai, dubai-Singapore, Dubai-Rome) although when I flew from Dubai to Dar Es Salaam the plane was quite dirty, a lot smaller than all the other planes and service was not as good. But overall, Emirates' more popular destinations provide a great service to their customers and I always fly with them. "
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"02 January,",,"I flew Emirates from Paris to Sydney via Dubai, then Perth to Paris and Paris to Perth, all via Dubai of course!

Never had an issue. Plane always on time and connections via Dubai are never long (about 2 hours wait)

Seats are really comfortable and if you are lucky enough to fly the A380, this is the top of the range of the planes!

Meals are delicious (I never thought I'd say that about a plane meal) and regular on this long 21-hour journey!

In-Flight entertainment is like I've never seen before! Now I don't even bother taking a laptop or an iPod because they have a wide selection of movies and music I like and funny video games (you can even challenge other people playing the same game in the same plane)!

I would only fly with Emirates until I get disappointed but I don't think it will happen anytime soon!"
Emirates,3-Oct,ar,"07 May,",,"Traveled with a family of six between Stockholm and Sydney and never ever ever again with Emirates.  After 40 years of air travel we managed to experience every possible scenario for what can go wrong followed by poor service and an unwillingness to help solve problems they created.  Flights were changed without notifying us, staff were rude and lazy.  Meals were poor and often missing items.  We require allergy friendly food and at each meal received fish and seafood which are highly allergenic foods.  Some of our kids received toys, others did not.  We were delayed more than 24 hours due to flight changes they failed to notify us of and it was difficult to get any help to fix this, even though we were not at fault.  The inflight entertainment did not work properly and was difficult for kids to navigate.  The check in process was traumatic to say the least.  Strongly recommend avoiding this airline if you are travelling with a family.  We felt very discriminated against but I have no idea why!  Previous experience with other airlines has been quite the opposite.  All your travel nightmares can come true with Emirates."
Emirates,3-Oct,ar,"07 January,",,"never want to fly with emirates ever again worst airline ever. the cabin crew is very rude and does not even bother to ask or offer assistance if a passenger needs it. my son fell ill because of their food. the crew awfully lacked the skills and had very bad customer service when i contacted them through email  it has been over nine months, they give you a general reply and say sorry, thats it. after we landed at Seattle they called the ambulance without asking me. they didn't even bother to provide first aid on the plane and for 4-5 hours my son suffered. they kept saying there is a doctor on board but they are very big liars,no Doctor ever came.  now i have to pay 3000 dollars US because of their poor food poisoning. worse flight ever in my life.

EDITORS COMMENT: Given the time between eating and your son being sick it is highly unlikely that a meal on the plane caused this - likely the meal before the flight. Regardless, better care should have been given on board to help given your son was unwell. "

Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"11 March,",,"I flew from Virginia, USA to Manila, Philippines via DUBAI, UAE. they weighed our carry on bags including our backpacks and duty free-purchased items. I paid almost $100 in excess carry on weight, I think they charged $50 per kilo (approximately) , I saw a lady paid almost $200 plus and the others are just throwing their stuff in the chair or giving it away because of the charges. This does not happen before in my previous flights with Emirates, I will not fly Emirates again if their is a price-comparative airline. Most people in our flight is very angry of what they did in DUBAI airport, and some of us are just a layover in Dubai. Some coming from Europe and I am coming from US. 
Beware of this money-making tactics of Emirates in Dubai flying to Manila, even it is your stop over/layover flight. 
Thanks. "

Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"18 January,",,Flew emirates from Nyc to Bangkok with a connection to Dubai. First off- there were too many babies on board and the families basically took over whole entire rows and slept on the floor. Forget trying to sleep- do not take the 1045pm flight. It was the same issue Dubai back to NYC. The bathrooms were a complete mess even a few hours in to the 14 hr flight. The passengers were loud and constantly fighting with the staff. It was a terrible experience. I will never fly emirates from NYC to Dubai again. 
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"26 April,",,"Very very surprised at negative comments here. I use Emirates from LHR to BKK (A380s) about 4 times per year as I am retired and live part of the time in Thailand. The staff are excellent, seats in economy are great. I always use their seat booking system (web based)  to get outside aisle seats. One flight my wife and I were on different planes to UK, the BKK staff put us on the same flight! That was very sweet of them. Another flight my wife was uprated to Business class. I am retired, spent my life flying, I tried other airlines to BKK before settling on Emirates economy. Really excellent airline and I am happy to spend lots of money with them. Food is good too they hand out menues before service.  In five years I've used them about 30 times, so this cannot be a chance one-off praise. Check your switch times at Dubai , 1 hour is cutting it too fine, unless you know Dubai Int.  8 hours too long. well done Emirates, the right customer service philosophy. "

The economy service on both these flights was exceptional.  Felt like a first class passenger without the glam.

One of the things that really set them apart was the hot towels they gave all the passengers after boarding.

The drama started when i missed My flight from Sydney to Beirut on 27/8/2016 as i  arrived late and couldn't catch the flight.. i went to the Emirate service counter and asked about the next flight to Dubai and was told that the next available is ten days from today and i was shocked cos that means i have to stay in Beirut another ten days to jump on the next flight and told them that this is impossible cos i have to catch my next booked flight from Dubai to Sydney on 31/8/2016 and they suggested that i look for any other airlines to book with and arrive Dubai before my next flight on 31/8/2016.I managed to book with Qatar airways next day (paid $2334.00) to catch my next flight with Emirates on 31/8/2016. on my departure day i was told that my booking was canceled and have to pay for another ticket which cost me ($2791.00). My complain is if i was provided with the right information by Emirates customer service in regards to the flight cancellation i could have waited for the next Emirates flight to avoid this high cost.

Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"20 July,",,"Rude and inconsistent customer service over the phone, specifically reps manning the singapore customer base. 

Issue 1: inconsistency- We couldbt make our flights last minute due to a death in the family - emirates said we could get a refund, but upon submitting the death cert they retracted the statement as it was not immediate family. After much explaining of what was earlier communicated, they said I can use the ticket credit within the year. 

Only later I realized that I will be slapped with a date change fee ($200/pax) twice because I had not reschedule my postponed trip credit immediately, ie during the funeral period.

Issue 2: rude - I never fail to get off the phone angry frustrated and promising myself never to patronize emirates, not just cuz of the unkind trip change policies but cuz there is no respect for customers. i'm careful to be polite in case they slap me with more ""hidden"" date change fines. Yet the reps are almost always abrupt and short tempered over the phone, they don't hesitate to say  harsh things like ""you should have read the terms and conditions that you signed"".

I've flown emirates before and enjoy the flight comfort and pricing, but after these 3 instances with their horrible customer service, I will never fly with emirates again and will actively discourage others to do so. Management should consider if outsourcing your front line service staff is a good idea, or improve training or empowerment to your staff."

Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,"I had a terrible experience flying with Emirates! I flew from Denver -> Boston -> Dubai -> New Delhi. All my check-in bags were weighed in Denver to make sure that their weights are under the allowed limit but nobody asked me about the carry-on luggage. I was able to board the flights from Denver to Boston and Boston to Dubai without any issues. However, Emirates crew in Dubai suddenly realized that they have a ""weight limit"" for cabin luggage as well and forced me to pay $100 at the gate in Dubai. Why was my cabin bag not weighed in Denver or Boston? I could have made some weight adjustments in Denver when I had all my luggage with me. In addition to this, the crew at Dubai airport was suggesting me to ""solve this problem""  by finding another passenger with less baggage and ""transfer"" some stuff from my bag to his. Is this not a security violation? On one hand, you are enforcing ""rules"" at the middle of my journey and at the same time, you are giving me ideas on how to break them? Very very disappointed with Emirates! Please make sure that ALL your employees are aware of your policies.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€™"
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"05 January,",,I fly to the UK regularly and this time chose to take the non stop ek449 ek448 flights through Dubai. Its a long flight let me tell you so you have to have durability. For their credit Emirates only fly their latest version of the A380 on the long haul and it is indeed an improvement on the earlier versions with slightly more legroom. The service was good and the meals fine. The Dubai hub is huge and let me say very confusing as you may well have to change terminals and also go up and down complex routes to find you your connecting flight. when things go a little pear shape as they did on the return journey due to fog then things get complex. There seems to be no one able to give clear instructions in English as to the length of the delay. So 500 people ended up for some hours sat on the floor at the appointed gate waiting for more information. None was forthcoming! 4 hours later we finally flew out. Emirates when things hit the fan you have to have someone tell your passengers whats happening in good understandable language.
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"30 March,",,"I was extremely disappointed with Emirates, after flying with a large number of airlines last year including budget ones the emirates service was very disappointing and that was after 4 flights with the airline. The staff were quiet rude, the service was poor, for example the  drinks service was after the food service, the meals were close together and the food was poor quality. At one point the airhostess collected my neighbours glass and put it sitting in my glass on my table and left it there. They also wake you up about 40mins before the flight lands and take your blankets at this stage, which is not acceptable on long haul flights."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"06 February,",,"The first thing to say is that the airbus 380 is a fabulously comfortable plane, and this is a major selling point. The cabin is spacious and new and plenty of seat room. The entertainment system  has so much variety that it makes  the flight seem shorter. A menu, discontinued by other carriers is a nice extra, and the food acceptable without being  haute cuisine. The staff are fine. A good experience though it is a shame they sponsor arsenal f c.!"
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"19 February,",,"We flew from Perth to Dubai and then from Dubai to New York City on Emirates. On the last leg from Dubai to New York we were seated 2 rows from the front where people can put their young children in the cots. Everyone around us seemed to have children, making our flight uncomfortable. I think it would be better if they seated all people with small children in the one area. We did complain, but there was nothing they could do as the flight was full. We appreciate there is not much they can do once we are onboard and the plane is full, but something should be done prior to boarding when people book to ensure all passengers can be as comfortable as possible, the air-staff would also spend less time dealing with complaints if this was done. If I had a small child I would prefer to be amongst other passengers with children, rather than be embarrassed about all the neighboring passengers complaining about my children. It seemed a bit unfair, four adults who had paid a lot of money for the flight weren't going to get any peace for 14 hours! Even ear plugs being provided would have offered a bit more quiet. The food was great though and we were able to get the meals we wanted.

On the flight home from Seattle to Dubai and then to Perth we had dinner and breakfast provided . We never once got the meal we wanted, by the time they had come to the front of the plane they didn't have any left of the popular selection. We also pressed our air hostess button a few times, but no one ever came to assist. And it did take them a while to clear away our trays.
We also found there was hardly ever any room for our hand luggage, other people in different rows had used our space, pushing ours to another section of the plane. Which didn't help when we wanted to get something out mid flight having to try and find it. Or when the flight land and everyone stand up in the aisle, but our bags were somewhere further down the plane getting moved around by everyone rushing to get off the plane. It would help if passengers were only allowed to use the space provided for their seat number"
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"02 August,",,"MEL to LHR  and return from gatwick.  Outbound was on a 777 to Dubai.  Could not fault the service or the food. Then we got on the a380 and it was a far different picture.  Service was terrible.  Food was left on the trays for well after an hour after everyone was finished.  Can you imagine the rush for the toilets?
Coming back, same scenario.  It seems the attendants are full of themselves on the 380.
I must make one comment on the food.  Overall, very good but seems the emphasis was on chicken. On the last segment before home, we decided to risk the fish. Omg. Fillet of perch. Out of this world. So fresh, so perfectly cooked it was like having a fisherman and a chef onboard with us.
Everyone raves about the entertainment but I hated it.  Touch control? No way.  Push the screen into the seat ahead of you and maybe you can get where you want to go."

Thank you especially to Renzo who looked after me wonderfully. Despite a problem with my luggage on the outward trip - which Emirates tried to address via email - I  will continue flying with Emirates for their wonderful service, their competent staff and their excellent in flight facilities.

A lot of people rave about Emirates but I had the opportunity to fly with both Emirates and Qantas on the same holiday so was able to make a direct comparison and although Emirates were good I think Qantas come out in front. The meals were very similar, the quality about the same but Emirates do give you a little bit more. The Qantas inflight entertainment  was only marginally better but the one thing which did stand out was that the Qantas crew did, in my eyes at least, seem better trained and a lot more professional. The Emirates Boeing  777 was only a few months old and had much larger screens then the Qantas A380. Seat comfort was about the same.  "

Each time I'm let down by the service, quality, seat space, crew, check-in, etc.
No different this recent trip.
Just returned home from 4wk Europe trip and was disappointed by each airline I used; Singapore, Alitalia, couple of small local connecting airlines.
But I managed to book flight from Athens to Dubai (3day stop over) then home to Melbourne on Emirates.
Best choice made over the last few years
The cabin crew were fantastic, food - very good, seat space - good and comfortable, great service and a smooth flight home.
Check-in and baggage drops, smooth and trouble free (unlike the others).
All I can say is I'll be booking Emirates from here on... Happy Happy Customer

Absolutely no support from Emirates, rude ground personnel and misleading indications (e.g., just pass border control and go at the counter, but counter is closed...). Finally re organize my trip myself. New date 8 December.
On 8 December I take it. On the second flight of the journey I am offered a broken sit. It is extremely uncomfortable to travel for 14 hours on a broken seat (and it's not what I pay for), but on top of that it is totally against passenger safety in case of turbulences (which can happen) and for landing (which is suppose to happen with a close to 100% probability). When I showed it to the crew they behaved in a totally rude manner. They started doing something after 5 hours when I lost my temper to make them react.
As per the claim, they directed to a link that does not work. Then the social media team did the same. Their answer were totally irrelevant. Issue still not solved, my flight back is today, terrible!"

I  have flown most of the carriers between Sydney and London over the last 25 years, including the likes of Aeroflot (before they were banned from Australia).

We were delayed on the tarmac for 2 hours waiting for clearance to take off in Abu Dhabi with no air con and no explanation! When we arrived in Sydney  we were further delayed because the crew had forgotten to pack the insect spray which is a quarantine requirement! Eventually the Aussie ground crew provided them with a spray and I was able to disembark passing the 'terminator' male steward who glared at me again as I left. Take my advice avoid at all costs."

Emirates,0 / 10,Sherry Waite,"03 November,",,"DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINES!! They rip off their passengers for reward miles. After spending $10,000 on business class tickets to attend a family wedding and $500 for their credit card, I saw that I could transfer my miles from my Capitol one card to Emirates and use it to book hotels. So I saved my points for the past 8 months and tranferred 150,000 points ($1500 value) to Emirates family skywood account However when I went to book the hotel Im not told that those transferred points cannot be used to book hotels only toward tickets. Well I dont need tickets, I need a hotel for this wedding and Im now out those points . This is a ripoff of the consumer , as they lure you in to make you transfer your miles and then you cant do anything with them!!! I will never book on this airlines again and I will close my credit card when I return from this vacation that I cannot get a hotel for as they have stolen my points."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"08 October,",,"My husband and I flew business class from Perth/Dubai/Warsaw and loved the flat beds, great food/beverages/in flight entertainment options/tablet provided. The selection of our own mini bar was a bonus. The lounges in Perth and Dubai were exceptional !

EDITORS COMMENT: Sounds like a very pleasant flight! Thanks for sharing your experience, "
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"04 February,",,"Emirates used to be good back in 2012, now they have too many customers and money to care about the customer experience. 
I took flight from JFK to Bangladesh through Milan then Dubai (8 hours flight each way). It was very uncomfortable 29 hours trip because the service was very poor and it felt like I was in prison with no food and water. Coming back was 39 hours trip which was torturous and I literally felt that a certain percentage of my life was gone.

When I press the assistance switch they did not even come for me for the entire 8 hours flight (same for Bangladesh to Dubai). Their service was so bad that I had to get up and get the water for myself after 90 minutes of waiting. Later on I realized that instead of rotating the stewardess on every transfer (8 hours), Emirates used the same stewardess over again and again. The stewardess were very tired and just stopped responding all together. They just served food and go back to their side. I overheard one of the stewardess complaining about being tired. 

I paid over $2,500 USD and it was not worth the money. The seats are so closed together that the guy next to me had to place his leg on my side just so he fits in his seat, and I could not even sleep because of that for (8 hours). If I knew that I was going to get in this kind of mess then I would have just taken Ittefaq and save money and time. The only thing good I can say about my trip was the food and entertainment system was good.

Emirates,9-Oct,Sonia Bergeron,"26 July,",,"Iâ€™ve flown many times with Emirates and I truly consider it as one of the best airlines in the world. Flying on their A380s is such an amazing experience! This is literally the best aircraft, especially the Emirates ones as they buy the best quality. Iâ€™ve always felt so save on their aircrafts as I know they always make all safety checks very thoroughly. They have a great entertainment selection with many movies / tv shows / music, etc so you can enjoy your flights. The food is always good and served in quantity. Also, they never lost any of my luggage, which is a very important point. Not like others!"
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"14 September,",,Took the A380 in Business class from BKK to DXB. The biz class is huge. The space to enter seats is very tiny. I felt oppress in this cabin. The food wasn't great. Had better food on Etihad or Swiss. The bar is a cool thing and crew very  friendly. 
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"23 December,",,"I'm a Gold status with Delta and now I know how great Delta is and it's service. The Emirates airline quality, service and their grade status levels. Is so not up to the standards of Delta, their rates for business and first class is so high and on top of that their upgrades is more ridiculous in fare difference then anyone else. For example I was on a flight were I was traveling from Dubai to Guangzhou and the entire business/first class cabin was wide open and Emirates were asking for 3 times the amount I purchased my economy standard ticket. So on this experience reminds me how privileged I am to fly Delta and will never fly Emirates ever again. "
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"18 July,",,"We usually fly Emirates between Brisbane and Auckland. Have flown other major airlines on this route but Emirates is our favourite. Arrival and departure times both ways are at a civilised hour, not arriving in the middle of the night.

Crew and in-flight service is above reproach."
Emirates,5-Oct,,"21 November,",,"This was our first flight using Emirates from Glasgow to Sydney via Dubai and it will be our last. We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite. The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stoney faces - no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience. Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains havenâ€™t come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband - are they not taught how to serve customers? We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final â€œthank you for flying Emiratesâ€ sounded matter of fact and so insincere. On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customersâ€™ comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers. Next time we fly to Australia we will use Singapore airlines again - far superior."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"01 November,",,"Unlike other companies, Emirates found a way to save a lot of money when it goes to refund their beloved customers for damaged luggage.
After damaging my luggage, I was not offered a new luggage but a money refund......and here comes the surprise. They asked me the purchase receipt. I replied that I didn't have it, and I provided photographic evidences of the luggage plus a link where to buy the luggage, where Emirates could verify the price. According to Emirates policy though the company refunds only 50% of the value if no receipt is provided.
I also proposed to the company to pick up the damaged luggage and to provide a new one, since i just want a luggage to travel and not their money. No way, only money refund....at 50% discount.
Now, how many of you keep the receipt? I would say just a small number, and of course at Emirates they are well aware of this."
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"04 July,",,"I am horrified and shocked at the treatment given to me at the Madrid airport, flying as a FIRST CLASS passenger. I arrived 3 hours before departure and the check in lady told me that my bag is overweight and I have to repack my bag. It was so embarrassing in front of everyone that I had to open and repack my baggage. However, I complied with the rules as my bag was overweight. I then came back to the counter to check in and the lady accepted my bags and issued the bag tag receipts. The airport manager of Emirates came next to us and started speaking to the woman in Spanish, ignoring the fact that I am standing there for 15 min just wondering what is going on. Then he rudely tells me that my smaller bag will not be accepted because it is a cloth bag. I said I will accept damage to the bag and sign the statement on the bag tag as well. He refused to listen and instead raised his voice at me and said that I have no choice and they will not accept my bag and if I don't want to travel I don't have to. I pleaded with him but he was rude and condescending and made me feel totally worthless. Finally I took the smaller bag and had to throw the contents. DO NOT FLY EMIRATES."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"13 October,",,We recently flew business class from Sydney to Auckland and return with Emirates on the A380. The flight staff were friendly and attentive from the moment we entered the cabin. The seats were roomy and comfortable and could be partially or fully reclined to a sleeping position. The inflight entertainment was comprehensive although the ICE system stopped working for the last part of the flight to Auckland so I couldn't award top points for inflight entertainment on that basis. The food was gourmet with a good selection of beverages. Overall this was a wonderful experience which I would highly recommend.
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"16 December,",,"I traveled return from Amman to Jakarta via DXB. Very slow Check-in. Amm-Dxb leg was ok, TV not working. They ran out of chicken meal option very soon, everyone had to stick with beef option. Dubai - Jakarta was great with Wifi for 1$ on board (500mb). drinks were plentiful, food was ok and flight attendants were attentive, loud and lively as usual, unlike Qatar airways crew who tend to float quietly around the cabin. "
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"27 December,",,Cabin staff did their duty..nothing more...not attentive and allowed people to walk around despite fasten seatbelt signs.  Also our meal request and extra blanket request forgotten. Good boarding scheme by zones.  The A380 seats are not comfortable for short people as head rest angle was awkward.
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"10 September,",,"I flew Emirates between Manchester and Ho Chi Minh City with a layover in Dubai. It was my first time using the airline and overall, my experience was perfect aoart from the following things.
The service took too long, i waited 20 minutes for a crew member to answer my call light. 
My ife system crashed every 30 minutes and would take 10 minutes to boot up, losing all proigress in tv shows, movies etc. The crew did nothing to help this situation. 
Apart from the few probkems, i would highly recommend chosing emirates"
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"15 May,",,"I recently flew from Brisbane to Paris return as a first time customer of Emirates. I was not impressed at all and would not fly them again. The staff were the most rude I have ever experienced, the A380 seats were hard and uncomfortable, the food was mediocre and the inflight entertainment was pretty average. They had lots of movies certainly but the majority were Indian/ Hindu/French etc with limited new release or even classic movies. Our flight from Dubai back to Brisbane had endless delays, from spending an hour extra waiting at the gate with no explanation to sitting in a hot plane on the tarmac while they fixed the aircon. Then the tow tug thing broke down in front of the plane! We had to listen to and watch the safety announcements in 3 languages which was very irritating as well. The toilets did not seem to be cleaned much if at all and were pretty foul towards the end of the flights. The crew did not care if passengers reclined their seats during meal service. No wonder that the concept of air rage exists. I am pleased I've booked with Singapore Airlines for our next European trip and will never fly Emirates again."
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"07 February,",,"On the 27th Jan 2017, I had a connecting business class flight from Amsterdam - Dubai - Johannesburg. I was extremely satisfied with the airline from AMS to DXB. The airline and the services was exceptional. However when connecting from DXB to JHB, my screen was not working. The friendly attendants tried several times to reset my screen to no avail. It is quiet unpleasant to travel a 6 hour flight with no TV. I must admit that the choice of aircraft is quiet a downgrade from DXB to JHB. I truly enjoy travelling with Emirates, however I sincerely believe that the fleet to JHB needs to be upgraded. And all screens should be tested before the flight. "
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"31 October,",,"During boarding from Dubai to Bangkok my daughter of 12 vomited in the plane (she felt better right after). The cabin-crew pushed us out of the plane by saying Emirates would take my daughter to a medical check and book us on the next flight. No worries, as Emirates would take care of all the costs involved. After the medical check (all was fine), the ground-people of Emirates made us pay 1.000 euro for rebooking to the next flight, no discussion possible. They were not interested in our story. There was no option for us than to pay the money. We flew in from Amsterdam so the alternative was flying back, which would have costs us approx. the same amount. When we came back home after our trip, I filed a complaint about this incident. After 4 weeks Emirates responded that it is standard procedure and hope we do not feel bad about them. No words about the fact that the cabin-crew ensured us that Emirates would take care of the rebooking of the flight nor about the discreditable behavior of the Emirates ground crew.
Shame on you Emirates. People, be aware of this airline with their so called customer service and best airline in the world lies."
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"15 September,",,"I was flying from Dubai to Delhi Flt no EK 510 in economy class. the plane was boeing 777 with very narrow seats. I had a middle seat and my wife had an aisle seat. The window seat was taken up by a very fat man who was spilling over to half my seat. I had to sit touching this fat person , I could not move my arms back or stretch my legs. I called the stewardess and she appeared after half an hour,I told her i had paid for a full seat but was getting only half.She appeared helpless so i asked for her senior, finally I was moved to another seat( after about 2 hours, total flight time was 2h 40 mins)."
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"02 January,",,"I came back from Turkey to Dubai on Emirates flight I had a horrible expreience the flight was delayed and when it landed there were many empty parkings connected to the airport available instead the aiplane parked at the very end of the airport after terminal 2 which took 15-20 minutes with the bus to get to terminal 3 and this is not the first time it happens, in fact I cant remember the last time Emirates didnt use the bus. The customer services as always horrible espicially when in Economy class and even in Business the staff can be rude, they are extremely rude to you if you're a local. Food is not so great I only eat because I am hungry. The prices are overrated and not worth paying. The only good thing about emirates airlines to me is that the airport is located 10 minutes away from my house. I'd rather fly on Etihad airlines and get on the road for an hour and a half to Dubai instead of using Emirates again."
Emirates,6-Oct,,"30 November,",,"I had the displeasure to fly Emirates Melbourne to London via Dubai , Then London to Mauritius via Dubai . Finally Mauritius to Melbourne via Dubai . Conclusions ...Unless you fly First Class your treated like cattle , in Cattle Class . I had to fly economy because First Class was book out solid and I had a time schedule to meet that could not be changed . The best part of the trip was Mauritius .....Like heaven on earth if you look for it . As for Emirates ....very cheap very nasty LIKE MELBOURNE AIRPORT , No airport rail link ....so 3rd world . Would gladly recommend Qatar , Cathay or Singapore Airlines ."
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"09 April,",,"Not impressed with the service, specially as I was travelling business class from Dubai to Hong Kong, dirty glass, asked to get it changed, was told by the stewardess that she will bring a clean one, never did, had to ask again. Asked for a bottle of water later on and again was told they'll come back with one, had to ask again.
Apart from the friendly welcome when I boarded, I can even remember being asked if all was all-right from time to time."
Emirates,8-Oct,Franco Lavagnini,"12 October,",,Mai avuto inconvenienti.
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"25 August,",,"Beware of misleading information on Emirates web pages - Manchester to Dubai flight.  Not sure if this is normal but we were offered only one refreshment on the overnight flight to Dubai and no tea or coffee or snack or drink in the morning.  No menus.  Complained to customer service who said they would investigate in 40 days - chased after 50 days and said they were behind.  When response came they said it was because of turbulance (when there wasn't any).  They said that refreshments are offered on all flights, so they obviously had not even read the email explaining that we had only one offered before our meal and that was it for over 7 hours. We had to go straight to Costa Coffee at the airport to find a drink on arrival."
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"20 October,",,"Flew from Manchester to Auckland, arrived at Dubau and was raced through the airport at nearly at a run, being nearly 68 and my wife suffering Parkinson's we were told just hurry, we were treated cattle by a local employee called Peter the food on the flights was discraceful they sold a seat which was supposed to be blocked according to checkin desk, which was a total lie, the cabin staff left a lot to be desired hardly saw them I was told Emerates was the best but having flown by cheaper airlines they have a long way to go to match them, I would never recommend Emerates to anyone and will certainly never use them again, give me Singapore airlines any day.

EDITORS COMMENT: A seat can never be guaranteed to be blocked  - if they need it they will use it. Running through the airport should have been done with a little car to assist you but unless they know on the booking that there are health issues they will assume that you are fit and healthy to get your own way to gates even if you have to rush. "
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"07 April,",,"Unorganized, chaotic, uncaring n souless service. The way families with young children were treated was absolutely disrespectful. Splitting our family up in the seating and squashing us in with the middle seats with an 18 month old baby was horrid, for us and the 2 poor people either side of us. The whole boarding process was a complete shambles and any questions fell on deaf ears, or the staff couldnt give an answer so they play ignorant. The less said about pilot skill the better. Small tip...ground level when landing is not 5 metres below the ground. We bounced more than a trampoline...i had such excitement at using Emirates for the 1st time. Now, with so much disappointment, it will be the only time. Never ever again. If that was your worst, i couldnt imagine your best being that good...wouldnt bother spending the extra money to fly with them. Not when the service is worthless. Nothing but headaches n stress which is the last thing you want when trying to get home after a long holiday. "
Emirates,10-Oct,Sabastian Ihekweme,"07 July,",,"Emirates is really wonderful. Seriously, fly them and you will find out that i'm actually underrating them by saying they are just ''really wonderful''. The cabins are neat, fine and comfortable, the food is great, the staff are nice and lovely and the In flight Entertainment, themed ICE, is excellent. I think the name ''ICE'' is really thoughtful- Information Communication Entertainment. Emirates is a very generous airline and patronizing them is worth every dime you spend. I've never entered an airline better than Emirates."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"22 March,",,"On behalf of my family, I would like to thank the staff and airline of Emirates outbound flight EK405 on 16/3/2016, 7PM.
The care and attention you provided to my family in economy was five star.
You were kind enough to let my son Nicholas who has a disability (Autism) to board before the other passengers, which ensured he would have a pleasant flight experience.
Thank you for allowing us up into the Business Class Deck to see just how the other half live ... hahahahaha..... it was amazing, and the cocktails were out of this world, delicious. Thank you Anu for arranging this ( I hope I have spelt your name correctly), you made a very big impression on my young son. Nicholas who thinks that all of the Emirates women look so pretty in the uniforms, especially the hats and scarves.
Thank you, we will certainly fly with your airline in the future."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"16 December,",,"Tutto perfetto, se c'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ un modo per coccolare i passeggeri sui voli Emirates lo troverete.

Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"24 April,",,"Travelled with Emirates for the first time and I will certainly be doing so again. Superb service throughout from all staff - extremely friendly, efficient, helpful and professional. High quality standard and food and beverage and a comfy seat."
Emirates,3-Oct,ar,"08 December,",,"I was impressed with advertisement, however reality is quite different. Please AVOID Emirates even if you have to buy expensive tickets...

1. No online check-in, therefore long queues
2. Mishandling of luggage, therefore don't be surprise if you're items are damaged
3. Strictly enforce carry-on luggage to 7 kgs only, therefore you've to check-in everything
4. Once you check-in luggage, there is high possibility of luggage being lost
5. Their IT department sucks, no information/coordination by ground staff
6. Inadequate staff, often overworked and untrained. Staff can be offensive, rude & condescending to customers
7. I was not able select vegetarian meal during booking, and they didn't serve me vegetarian meal. I had to skip my lunch and the staff was unconcerned.
8. There is no coordination by ground staff. They lost my luggage and it's been more than a week now
9 . There is no option to write e-mail or file compliant on their website. They evade it by asking too many details, which you'll not have
10. Most negative feedback is coming from people who deal with Dubai airport, therefore to resolve any issues with luggage, reach out Dubai helpline

To summarize, Avoid Emirates!"
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"11 January,",,"Only one word Exellent , Crew are really polite and helpful, i really enjoyed my trip, I will choose Emirates for my next trips"
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"29 August,",,"I travelled Birmingham to Bangalore on 17th Aug with EK40.
Flight got delayed by 27 Hours. Whenever we ask for the reason of delay, member were giving predifined answer like ""flight will depart after 1 hour"".
like that they extended for 7 hours then alotted for hotel. 
Informed us that dinner will be provided in hotel but no information given to hotel and finally we slept without dinner.
Next day vacated hotel morning 8 am but again started same story of ""flight will depart after 1 hour"". Finally departed birmingham @5pm.

Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,"I have used Emirates for many years but lately I am having problems with them one behind the other with my miles and late flights, then they do not want to cover the hotel or food expenses.  I have just being left with my daughters at midnight in JFK without luggage and without hotel.  After that, they rebooked our tickets in a different class of what I bought and they do not want to credit me the right amount of skywards on mine or my daughter's account.  I have call them and write many times without any response..!!!  Second case: We bought another tickets Milan/ Dubai/Milan at a different time, paid in a different currency and in a different class, now they are trying to put all the trip together and give me less miles..!!! Be careful with them, they are not committed with their customers as they used to be before, it is a shame..!!!  "
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"07 October,",,"On our journey from Dubai to Pakistan we had to sit with a blanket over our faces due to the fact that the whole of that area smelt of sick before, during and throughout the journey we asked to be moved and they said no which we found disgusting as it was a long flight where all we could smell was sick, as we smelt the smell as soon as we got on this made me think that the hygiene was not good at all as it would have been cleaned from the last flight, overall I would not recommend Emriates and their staff are rude stuck up and lazy. "
Emirates,2-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,"The worst service ever! Thieves! Do not use such horrible company.
We lost lot of money because they refused to make check-in. "
Emirates,3-Oct,ar,"28 September,",,"It's one of the worst airlines I've ever flown.

1. I had a very bad experience starting from the check-in counter. The guy didn't allow me to bring my camera gear to cabin since it's exceeding 7kgs. At the end, I had to pay AED 600 for another extra seat so I could bring the bag into cabin. The guy didn't even apologise for the inconvenience and no smile on his face.

2. I spent appx. 90 minutes to get the issue resolved and at the end I had to run fatto the gate as it was closing down

3. There was no welcome face on the plane. Even the stewardess questioned me about my two tickets. It seemed there was no coordination with the ground staff.

4. Aircon inside the plan was very cold and there's no way to turn it down.

5. The flight delayed for one hour. There was no apology from the pilot."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"15 May,",,I fly 2 yrs ago with emirates from Australia to england i found every part of my trip enjoyable the food was really good for airplane food esp considering im a extremely fussy eater i ate nearly all of every meal staff were really good and entertainment was superb seats were average but what seat would be comfy esp on a 14hr flight im just lucky I'm tiny so was easier for me than some taller people on issue i had was sitting at the window not able to sleep or get up and down but that was due to my in experience not the lack of staff or airline im due to fly the same route in 12weeks and im looking for to flying emirates again
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"20 May,",,"I'm amazed at some of the poor reviews. I fly Emirates all the time between US and Mid East, and Mid East and SE Asia. It is a very reliable, on time airline and cabin crew very friendly and helpful. To me, what makes or breaks a good experience are the passengers, and one needs to be very aware that certain nationalities do not discipline children, and are free to scream and impose with total disregard to others. Emirates can't randomly select who they let on board. And while crew frequently bring soft drinks around during a flight, passengers also should be aware that a snack basket with drinks is kept in the galley, to collect at will. Food in economy is on par with other airlines, and if you fly frequently on a route, the menu tends to stay the same. In business, the meals are great, as are snacks in bar area. If I have a complaint, it's not against Emirates, but the congestion at DXB, which can lead to delayed push-backs and holding patterns. I've been a gold card member for years, and will always choose Emirates. They've never let me down."
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"18 January,",,"I recently took a business class flight from Bangkok, Thailand to Burlington VT. We stopped in Dubai and New York on the way. The last leg of the flight was an economy flight from Jetblue. 

In addition the Emirates destroying my Samsonite hard shell suitcase and refusing to take responsibility, the staff were generally unfriendly and disinterested. Highly disappointed, especially comparing to Qatar Airways"
Emirates,4-Oct,Desire Oosthuizen,"04 March,",,"We lodged a complaint, but was told to put in a refund for our returnable tickets separate. We paid R16900 for returnable tickets and was only refunded R685. The complaints were not even looked at for the delay we had at Manchester airport, then missed our flights at Dubai due to their delay, then booked in at a stinky airport hotel for a flight the next morning. Told us our expenses will be covered, but couldn't even get a glass of water so had to buy refreshments out of our own pockets. We never received our baggage as promised by the airport and was left with no chronic medication and no clean clothes. At the airport, due to their handling we were told to re-wrap our luggage, things that were bought at Manchester airport, sealed, scanned for and with receipts, were confiscated as we were never informed that we cannot leave the airport with it. Now we request a full refund on our return tickets and are told that they don't refund because we already used part of the ticket"
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"30 April,",,I really was shocked with the seat type at the Business class. I don't know why they have this high partition between the 2 seats and you don't have the room to place your arm. I was very uncomfortable with the 5 hours business trip to Bangladesh. The problem is that Emirates is the only airline that goes there directly. I have no other choice. Don't know how I can manage my next trip.
Emirates,3-Oct,ar,"30 September,",,"Disrespectful staff and poor service.

I have been flying with your airline via many routes, and i have noticed the food served from DXB to IKA (TEHRAN) always seems to be the worst of not just emirates, but any other airline i travel with. This cannot be a coincidence as other friends and colleagues have noticed the same and many complaints have been made without any changes. EMIRATES IS INVOLVED IN PURE DISCRIMINATION and as a customer I do not want to get involved in the current politics between Emirates and Iran, but once a company charges so much for a ticket the least they can do is to provide the same service which they do in many other routes, and not leave the worst food menu for these people who have as much right as anyone else

Please spread the word regarding emirates bigotry and treatment of flights to Iran, I for one will try my best not to fly with your airline again! "
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"22 March,",,flew emirates from Boston USA to Male in the Maldives....unless you can afford business or first class do it....  the economy class on the 777 was nothing but pure torture.

Love Emirates and I look forward to using them again in the future."

Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"28 January,",,"I'm not usually one to complain about airlines because I am a anxious flyer and if I make it safetly on ground I don't worry but this was unacceptable, I was very excited to fly with Emirates until reading reviews and became nervous at such poor ratings for such a airline like Emirates, I feel that if your in economy the service is very poor, we didn't get our meals until 2 hours after take off due to turbulence (understandable) but what I don't understand is why some people did and others didn't or why no hostess came around with water and snacks in the mean time, it was a night flight and no lights were dimmed or turned off until 3 hours in?! I had asked for water quiet a few times to one host and he never gave it to me so finally I asked another hostess and got it straight away, lots of people were complaining around me due to such poor service, we may be economy but we are the majority of your customers so some type of service would be nice, I have flown on cheaper airways with much better service. Except for that, a few hostess were extremely helpful when a baby was crying for majority of the flight and the inflight entertainment was great. "

Emirates,8-Oct,,"14 February,",,"The A380 is a seriously comfortable plane compared with the alternatives.  It is quieter, and there are fewer issues with air pressure and humidity.  It means you step off the plane feeling so much more relaxed.  We flew on this plane from Dubai to New York and it was a refreshing change from the cramped 777"
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"22 November,",,"Four flights onboard Emirates a380, while the economy seats and entertainment are very good I'm afraid the same can't be said about the very bland food and miserable service from the cabin crew who on all four flights were totally uninterested in the passengers,to the point of being rude and obnoxious. Not sure what the ""Emirates experience "" is supposed to be but I definitely wasn't feeling it,a real let down. "
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"18 June,",,Dubai - Khartombe return. Aircraft old model A340. Food on both sectors barely edible. Khartombe - Dubai chicken with potatoes however no chicken in portion. Desert of unknown type. Looked like rice pudding someone had eaten before. Big plus with air crew as tried to do their best with broken porduct.
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"05 August,",,"My wife and I have regularly flown Emeriates economy but we decided to treat our selves by flying Business class from Manchester  UK to Perth Australia. We Flew in a Boeing 777. At meal time even though we were sitting in the third row of the cabin we were told that we couldn't have our desired meal because other passengers had them.  We were then instructed to select either an Arab dish or an Indian one. Neither was appealing but I selected the lesser of the two evils and selected the Arab chicken meal. I arrived in due course over cooked and dried out and as a result I couldn't eat the dish. I have never had such bad food in Economy with Emeriates.  After a wonderful change over in Dubai we boarded the next 777 for Perth. This time were seated at the rear of the Business section which made us wonder if there would be sufficient food for us this time. Sure enough we were denied our selection and again offered either an Arab dish or or an Indian dish. This time I pointed out to the steward that considering the considerable cost of my ticket I should not have to eat the food that other passengers had declined. After a literally stand up argument the steward said he would see what he could do. In due course he returned with our desired selection which was perfect. This argument over food I found very upsetting and ruined what should have been a wonderful trip for my wife and I. 

We will never travel Business Class with Emeriates again. We would recommend to anyone that unless they like Arab or Indian food they should avoid Emerates like the plague."
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"24 April,",,"Emirates flight from Dubai to Seychelles. I paid for four airfares for myself and my family and I was travelling with children and ended spending at least 20 minutes on a bus whizzing through Dubai runway to board our flight. Please Emirates it is unacceptable to pack fare paying passengers on a bus with no seating facilities to board a plane stationed twenty minutes drive from the airport terminal (GATE). My daughter was exhausted, my wife broke her shoes through this mayhem. Passenger were falling and tripping over each other each this stupid bus took a turn. This is not what I paid for. I paid for airfares not a bus fare. If you want to use a bus, can it be at least a comfortable service. Provide seating, plan a better route. This is an accident waiting to happen.STOP whizzing people through airport traffic and planes. This is irresponsible, TWENTY minutes???"
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,"The emirates airline is absolutely hopeless and frustrating when it cones to dealing with aged people when a wheelchair is needed. I have been asking for a wheelchair for one week but they couldnt commit to it due to my mothers stay at Dubai was 8 hours. There is absolutely no guarantee whether the patient will get a wheelchair. So basically you just throw your patient out in the blue and a chance of getting wheelchair is just 50/50. 
When i was frustrated with their services i was tempted to use Marhaba transfer and lounge services. Had to go through the same scrutiny and paid 150 aud for this whole drama. If eimrates airlines spends loads of money on hotels outside airport , why dont they help their customers to book in marhaba lounge. 
I would recommend some other airline when you have aged people with wheel chair requirements."
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"03 February,",,"Traveled from colombo to Sydney on 30th with my 3 year old kid and 32 weeks pregnant Wife. When I came to Colombo Air port to get the boarding pass I was told by Emira staff at ticket counter that they cant offer 3 seats to travel together. So I informed them the situation and they asked me wait 10 mins. But after 30 minutes they came and said flight is full and can offer only 2 seats together. Then i showed them the tickets and It clearly showed that I have already booked 21 A, B and C. Then i was told to wait few minutes but it took another half and hour to issue the boarding passes. I don't how they can offer already booked seats to someone else.Again I had to wait at the gate as error message started to appear on your system when they scan my boarding passes and We got in to the flight just two minutes before the departure. Totally i had to wait nearly one and half hours due to your staff fault and I think I don't want to mention how difficult the situation with 3 year old boy.

Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"03 February,",,"I had Bad experience with Emirates. We had issue with Entertainment system from our San Francisco flight to Dubai on 12/23/2015. When we complained about the issue to customer service in Dubai airport they do not really care. Very disappointing attitude. 

While on return Journey we had 8 and Half hours lay over in Dubai when I have requested for a Hotel as we have Infant they said they cannot do it. My Kid was sick at that time and we suffered in Dubai Airport

Me and all of my Family members are Frequent to fly with Emirates. I will never Fly with Emirates again.

EDITORS COMMENT: That's a long flight to have malfunctioning IFE!  With regards to the layover,  it's not the airlines responsibility to give hotel accommodation to transiting passengers. If the layover seems too long when you are searching for flights its best to search what other airlines offer instead. "
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"15 September,",,"I have been flying Emirates since 1994 (I guess), I have noticed the service to be going up and down at times... I practically thrice in the past 11 months from Boston To Asia and Back on Emirates and the service was again very mix.... It was not poor at any time, but I could say that Emirates could use better aircrafts for service at Boston. I have noticed broken trays to broken entertainment system to lost special meals and to even delayed baggage as well. The aeroplane B777-300ER is always full and at the end of the journey the smell inside the aircraft is unbearable. Emirates should look into cleaning the lavatories more and probably use some air freshner as well.  ..  I wish Emirates best of luck, but I might be considering other airline(s) out of Boston for my next international travel plans."
Emirates,7-Oct,ar,"12 June,",,"Perth - Gatwick - Perth (5 times). I echo the comments regarding Emirate's 3-4-3 seating in economy on the 777. It's cheap and mean, especially as Emirates is no longer a low cost carrier. I have now booked a flight on Qatar Airways because they are cheaper and have a 3-3-3 layout with 50 mm extra width. Food is generally OK, and really good if you can get into business class. Staff are quite helpful. There is often an irritating 1/2 hour bus ride from the runway to the terminal which is not what you want after an 11 hour flight."
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"13 February,",,"Emirates did not allow the 1st connecting flight (Jetblue) carrier to issue boarding passes for the whole trip and also they did not take any responsibilities of delays of Emirates chosen 1st carrier when connecting flights by themselves, This happened when we booked tickets via emirates.com. They left us at JFK and went to Dubai even though we were in the connecting flight from Florida to JFK, we had to stay in New York for 2 days on our own expense. I do not recommend Emirates for anyone, please stay away from Emirates. 

EDITORS COMMENT: Thanks for sharing this useful information. Just to clarify - this is fairly standard with a  lot of airlines not just emirates. "
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"29 November,",,"I took flight 729 from Dubai to Entebbe on 20 November, 2015.  Much I very much appreciate the customer care you airline always offers, I think this experience at boarding time was not what I expect of Emmirates. This traveling economy class were made to remain standing in the transit bus for almost thirty minutes as other passengers trickled in. Some of themselves had kids yet there were no seats in the bus! This was very painful to the who came on time! I see no log ice in making passengers get fed up and worn out from the beginning of the journey! Why not let them wait I the preboarding lounge till they are many enough to fill the bus then let them board?"

Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"15 March,",,"Flew from Munich to Dubai. Staff at check in seemed not very knowledgeable: I'm a Skywards Gold member so am allowed to bring additional luggage, however the guy who checked me in wanted me to pay for the additional luggage. Had to point out to him that I am allowed more. 
Boarding was very hectic, as the boarding was done from 2 gates (A380) and I was sent back and forth by the staff between the 2 gates, as apparently the gate mentioned on my ticket was the wrong one. In the plane people were walking back and forth in the isles as some took the wrong tube to enter (there were no signs)
When dinner was served I had a choice of chicken or fish. I wanted the fish, but this was already finished. This has happened now several times that I could not get the meal of my choice. When I mentioned this, I was told that I should indicate a special meal when booking the flight. Really??? They were then trying to see if they could somehow find a fish meal anyway, but they then forgot about me...15 minutes laterI asked about it and all they had was the chicken. When I finished my meal they came to tell me they did find one, but it would take 20 minutes to warm up... No thanks. "
Emirates,8-Oct,,"13 February,",,"We flew from Perth to Birmingham with Emirates via Dubai at Christmas time (departed 19th December, returned on January 10th).    The food was excellent, very fresh and there were snacks available if needed. Seats were comfortable and could tilt back which was great, however, not so great if everybody didn't tilt their seats back! The inflight entertainment was top class with personal screens and a huge number of movies (new and old), tv shows and radio/cds to listen to, it made the long haul flight much more enjoyable. We travelled through Dubai which was extremely busy but all flights left on time and boarded quickly. The flights were expensive but that is usual that time of year so was expected.          "

Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"27 October,",,"The cabin crew's attentiveness was disgraceful. I noticed that my headphones didn't work so asked a stewardess for a replacement pair shortly after take off. After a half hour, I assumed she'd forgotten and pressed the assistance button. It remained ""ON"" for the remainder of the flight. Staff did their very best to avoid eye contact and ignored further hails. The lady in front also hailed a crew member (quite loudly) only to have her turn her head as she walked past!! Only one of the meals on the menu was still available when we were served. And they served us relatively early. We paid a premium to fly with Emirates, so were disgusted by the lack of service.

When i was onboard i was so tired i fell asleep during flight. When food was served i was woken up and so i said i did not want dinner. The air hostess remarked that is it my intentions not to be disturbed and that i should have a sticker to stick on the seat. I said sorry i didnt realise. After a while i woke up, but however i was not given food or offer a drink again throughout the whole 8 hour transfer flight back to Birmingham.
Thanks Emirates for making me delayed for 7 hours sleeping in the airport lounge and also have touchy air stewardess who dont consider flyers might be just tired and not grumpy when they first decline food service. It doesnt mean they dont want refreshment all through the flight

EDITORS COMMENT: Unfortunately in Economy with so many passengers the cabin crew simply can't serve food around passengers sleeping times. If you are asleep and want the meal later that's not going to happen as they are not allowed to reheat a meal for food safety reasons. "
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"08 July,",,"DXB-LAX-DXB on A380 in Business Class. Was extremely disappointed in that Emirates has crammed 7-across in this cabin 2-3-2, unlike other ""premium"" carriers who all offer less across--even on smaller planes. This makes the seats extremely narrow, difficult to sleep in, and there are NO seats to choose that do not entail suffering someone climbing over your legs or you climbing over theirs in and out, unless the flight isn't full and it usually is on Emirates! All other services were up-to-the-mark and no complaints. But on a long trip like this, seat comfort and room makes up for a huge percentage of the overall experience. Emirates is in clear and present danger of becoming an inferior product to their competitors (Eihad comes to mind on this super-long non-stop route!) even though EK has the A380! ""Stars"" are being subtracted only for the cramped premium-class seating layout!"
Emirates,8-Oct,Shivika Perera,"17 March,",,Best airline ever with the friendliest cabin crew. Overall the in-flight entertainment is excellent. Though the ticket prices are high their service is the best. Meals are a bit poor. I appreciate if u guys can make the menu a bit more exciting just like the Singapore airlines menu. Need to work on that.
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"31 March,",,"I do not usually make a complaint but am making an exception for Emirates. I booked and paid for seats on the 10th February for the flight from Manchester (UK) to Dubai  for myself and my wife  and would have done the same from Dubai to Melbourne  If I could have accessed the plane seat plan which did not work.
The booked seats were confirmed and we boarded the plane at Manchester on the 5th March. We were told our seats were not available due to a change in seating arrangements. When we asked why the change had not been advised prior to boarding the plane we were told to make a complaint via the Emirates website. On arrival at our final destination  with our family in Cairns I eventually, with difficulty, was able to complete the complaint form and later received a response that the enquiries would take up to 30 days.
I had the same problem on the 30th March when I again tried to change seats for the flight from Melbourne to Dubai and to Manchester. When I telephoned to ask for advice I was told that since our flight from Cairns to Melbourne was with Qantas, Emirates could not make any changes.
I have never had similar problems in the past with Qantas or Singapore airlines "
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"19 September,",,"This is the first time I have reviewed an airline. My review is based upon my (our) experience with lots of other airlines from North Korea Air at the very bottom to British Airways at the very top and lots of major and minor airlines in between. 

I wanted to share our complete safety alarm with our 5 leg journey from Sydney to Dubai (August 2016), Dubai to London, Prague to Dubai, Dubai to Bangkok, Bangkok to Sydney (September 2016). 

Most alarming across ""all flights"" were the total disregard for passenger safety in the cabin. These are the examples i saw first hand; passengers allowed to stand and crew continue serve when the seatbelt sign is clearly on and also mentioned over the PA, passengers going to the bathroom while the seatbelt is on and the plane actually in turbulence, and passengers totally unchallenged in getting their cabin baggage as the plane was moving on the main taxi runway at Gatwick.

If cabin staff across these 5 legs consistently show disregard to passenger safety one can only speculate that there is a endemic problem at Emirates. So far as i am concerned i will not fly Emirates Airlines until they show a total backflip toward passenger safety. "
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"12 June,",,"We flew from Dubai to Vienna in March 2012. The aircraft was a 777, we were in economy class. The flight was the start of our holiday and what a great start.  The onboad crews service was exceptional by any standard. The aircraft itself was clean and fresh and the entertainment system just can not be beaten. Since that flight I have flown extensively with Emirates - mostly longhaul flights - and they have never disappointed me. Great airline."
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"18 June,",,"Been flew with Emirates from Australia to Austria, on 2015 and 2016. It was very please experience overall. It is expensive than others but it worth of spending, because we like to fly the quickest flights rather than lay overs.  Would recommend and will fly again in the future. Maybe next time we will try to fly from Bali instead of from Austria  a as we would like to spend a few days with my family than Austria with my husband family. The airport in Dubai was excellent, mostly shopping for guddgets or electronics. And the restaurants and cafes so much choices. Mostly on time and the check in staffs really great."
Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"01 July,",,"SYD / DBX / FCO - VCE / DBX / SYD. i am 6ft+, the economy seat pitch is appalling. How an airline expects you to sit, sleep and eat in the seat provided is ridiculous, then, once your advised your selection is not available you move on to a cold bread role, freezing cutlery and followed by a very chilled red wine. All juggled on a tray designed to allow said cold cutlery, bread role and any other item not tied down to fall on the floor, this naturally takes place after the traveller in front has pushed his seat (cell) back in order to make it impossible to eat. Now the crew, Emirates proudly announced they had many language speakers onboard, I am not sure but I think one of the announcements was in English, anyway it may as well all been in Italian as it was totally garbled and unintelligible. The crew were very average, more concerned with discussion amongst themselves than actually looking and speaking directly to the customer. The good, they actually controlled and boarded sections as should be i.e. passengers at the rear boarded first. Every flight on time, baggage arrived and an extraordinary good entertainment system given the cross section of travellers. Emirates are typical of an airline that has grown quickly but unable to maintain its customer service at the level required with this growth.  "
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"07 August,",,"the emirates plane which went up in flames in Dubai airport was a known event before emirates departed Dublin for Dubai. I had a connection to perth which you would think a competent airline would arrange for reconnection for you, instead me and thousands of others got off in Dubai and made queue for hours and hours in lines where there was no information no management, no consideration for emirate passengers what so ever, young or old, after 5 hours of queuing I was exhausted. in this time only a handful of people were dealt with as emirates staff could not process the connection changes themselves but could only stare into computer screens and require services of their helpdesk which mostly rang out. I have never in my life come across such incompetence and complete disregard for their customers well being. no info, no talking, no announcements, no help, and on top of that no security, no crowd or Q control leading to several fights within the crowd in Dubai. an absolute nightmare completely mismanaged and mishandled by Dubai airport and emirates. emirates staff and systems (booking) are neither trained or appropriate for dealing with such issues (a hub airport/airline should be)"

The return flight from Paris to Dubai was characterised by meals being served at bizarre times , and it was as if the staff just wanted to get it over with .
As we had left Paris at a reasonable time , we were offered breakfast at 3.30 in the morning , and lunch at 8.30 am Paris time .

They only compensating 5 passengers instead of 8 and despite all luggages for 8 passengers were delayed more than 24 hrs.

Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"01 July,",,"We travelled from Perth to Dubai on an A380 for the first time.
Despite booking months in advance, we were given seats in the very rear (tail section) of the plane.   88A and 88B.
The Chart in the seat pocket referred to these seats as ""bad"" for their location.
When checking in we asked if we could have seats in a central location, but were just given these.
What does a person have to do to get a reasonable seat these  days.?
Half way across the Indian Ocean, I thought the plane was going to fall into the sea.
It shook violently from side to side for quite some time and I had never experienced such violent shaking before.
From Dubai to Perth, we were given a "" breakfast "" after about 90 minutes  ( about 4am ) and then nothing to eat until about 3.30 to 4.00pm.
I presume that Emerites expects everyone to sleep in their seats for all of this time, but what about those who can't sleep.
A sandwich and a drink would have been well received, but northing was offered.
Finally, before take-off at Dubai, the Stewards were suppose to walk around and check to see that everyone was sitting upright and had their seat belt on.
Where I was seated, I could see people laying across 3 seats, obvious.

Emirates,5-Oct,ar,"19 January,",,"On a recent flight from Cape Town to Sydney I was shocked at how emirates have completely dropped the ball. They use to be a great airline but now they are so incredibly rude and will arrogantly brush off any criticism as the passengers problem. In Southern Africa they changed the baggage policy but failed to properly inform the passengers. Instead of one 30kg bag you must now take two 23kg bags which meant many passengers had bags over 23kg. To ""get out"" of this dilemma, emirates makes you pay a standard $75 penalty fee. I was shocked at the sheer volume of passengers that had to pay this fee. When I complained to the ground staff I was rudely shouted at by their senior manager "
Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"24 January,",,"The Emirates Business Class product is very good indeed.   One of the real plus points is the chauffeur service to get me to and from the airport,  This represents a saving of over Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£250 on taxi fares.  The lounges at Gatwick and in Dubai are very good, whether you want to relax, have a meal before your flight or sit down and do some work.

On board the seats are a little on the narrow side and are not the best for sleeping in, even when the seat is fully extended in to a flat bed.  The food is pretty average.  I have have had better on other airlines, but have also had a lot worse.  I normally eat in the lounge where the choice, quality and freshness is much better.  

The on board complientary bar on the A380  is a nice touch but I wonder how long it will be before a) it will continue to be free or b) it will be removed altogether.  There is room for at least 4 or 6 more seats in that space - we all know how the bean counters like to maximise revenue !!

Emirates is my airline of choice and I am prepared to fork out the extra for Business Class.  I did once fly in economy on a 777 and it is not an experience i would care to repeat"
Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"01 March,",,"Recently flew from Dallas to Dubia. The advertisement for Emirates is very deceptive. They stop video before getting to economy section, where seats are much to small and leg room is neglectable. I would be glad to pay a little more money for more leg and seat room. I have bragged about this airline to my friends, for I flown emirates before and it was a nice experience, but not this time. Will choose another airlines next time. Let me say, service  was great, all employees worked hard on that long flight, no complaints there. Just NOT enough room in economy."
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"28 December,",,It took over 1 hour after to take off for a drink or any service. It then took a further hour for the waste from our meal to be collected.

This was my first and last very disappointed flight with Emirates. I would take Qantas any day over Emirates.

December 2015. KARACHI, PK TO VICTORIA, CANADA There was a city wide emergency situation due to a major water pipeline burst which caused traffic havoc. Flooded roads and stalled traffic caused immense flight and passenger delays. I was unable to make it to the airport within the regular check in time. However, managed to reach an agent while my Emirates flight was still boarding. I was denied boarding by Emirates and charged a USD 600 'no show' fee. Emirates was busy accommodating passengers from the previous flight. Not only did they not accommodate me and other stranded fellow passengers, but additionally I was repeatedly told and I quote: ""The predicament you found yourself was not due to Emirates""!!!
It was the most stressful travel experience I have ever had. A badly done job Emirates!

Emirates,6-Oct,ar,"17 September,",,"Having recently flown east-coast Australia to north Africa, then Australia to Abu Dhabi, and then Brisbane to Barcelona all within the last 11 months, I can authoritatively report that First Class A380 Emirates is no better than Etihad Business (at half the cost).  Apart from the 4 minute phone box size on board shower on the Emirates A380 (more of a time-filling novelty than a necessity anyway), there is nothing to commend Emirates over Etihad.  The crew out of Brisbane is on their last of a six-leg Auckland run, and ours was obviously and overtly tired and de-motivated.  We were expecting a nice experience, and after the limo and efficient Emirates First check-in, there is no glamour whatsoever as all their lounges are crowded, noisy and tired.  And getting off via stairs onto a bus is not a First class experience, nor is zero priority boarding on the return leg.  Our experience suggests Emirates has grown too big too fast, their A380's 84+ business & 14 First class seats are sterile, and the interior offers nil glamour.  The on-gound and airport experiences are dumbed down for the volume, and don't provide the back-up for cabin crews that otherwise tried quite hard.  The A380 is too big, too slow, noisy and despite repeated requests/complaints from everyone in the First cabin that it was stuffy, the aircon is just too hot.  No flights suits/jamas in business, No socks and or earplugs in First is not a premium experience and we're still awaiting one piece of luggage that went astray."
Emirates,4-Oct,ar,"20 August,",,"Recently my fiane and I decided to take a short vacation to Greece, upon EK 3109 and returning on EK 3110. We are currently living in the UAE and always travel with Emirates for all our international destinations. I have done a fair amount of traveling this past month and usually the level and quality of emirates airlines is superb. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for our trip to Greece. We are both Skywards members and It saddens me to see that the amount of money one spends to fly with a world renowned, quality airline simply cannot be justified. On our flight to Athens, both of our seats were broken, making it very difficult and uncomfortable to even sit back. The cabin crew completely dismissed my order for drinks and then brought an entirely different order to what I had requested. On top of this there was a system error with the tv screens, which caused a delay for almost half an hour. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem but it is highly concerning considering one of the cabin crew informed us that the aircraft was an old one, which does not bode well for the service one expects when paying the rates for a top airline. We experienced the same issues on our flight home and were informed it was the same aircraft we had flown from DXB to Athens a week earlier. According to the staff the plane was full and we couldn't even be moved into seats that didn't spring back and forth due to broken recliner buttons. It saddens me to write such a report but I also do expect a certain level of comfort and service when I willing choose to pay fees for top class flights. "

During the wait, we only compensated with 2 drinks (1 water). Truly disappointed with Emirates and seriously considering to take other aircraft for future flights. 

EDITORS COMMENT: The airline doesn't need to legally provide anything on a delay that short - they actually went beyond their requirements in doing two drink runs. Delays are frustrating and they happen but this was handled ok.  "

I have heard a few people mention that their services have been lacking recently. I must say, our journey with them was the worst I have ever had in my entire life. The crew are not service oriented at all and actually very rude, we waited 2 and a half hours before we were even OFFERED water or a drink of any kind. I had stewardesses telling me ""no"" and ""I am too busy"" so many times it was embarrassing. The crew gave off the impression that they would rather be anywhere other than serving you on that aircraft. And do not even bother complaining, they have no customer service team- they have an email that will give you a generated standard reply but when I did more digging and calling, they admitted that they do not have a phone number or a team that I could speak to. 
The best thing you could do is STAY AWAY FROM EMIRATES!!!! Worst airline in the world, and I have tried most of them! "

Emirates 16 hour flight - inadequate feeding arrangements
I plan to pack a snack pack on the return flight from Orlando.
Meal served soon after take off was satisfactory.Then pizza soon after, which I declined because I wasn't hungry.
4 hours before landing I requested a piece of fruit or a dry cracker, the menu suggested that these snacks are available between meals. I was told that there was nothing left, ""everything has been demolished"" I was told by a steward. Whilst I understand the limitations of food on board, I would expect something small to snack on for a flight of this length. Eventually, after saying how astounded I was, one of the stewards said they knew where a stash could be found! Why was it not readily available anyway? He gave me two small packets. 
Worse still, every cup of coffee I had was lukewarm so I Asked for tea, that was worse, it looked like dish water, the colour was not tea!
The icing on the cake, I asked for a drink of fruit juice an hour and a half before landing and the steward said there was none available because it was all packed away! 
I am astounded and disgusted - Emirates, "

Bring on PER-LHR so no more EK metal and no more QR and MH.

I saw 15 traveller at their counter screaming at them for canceling their tickets.  The way the staff at the airport reacted towards the passengers shows that they are actually used to passengers screaming at them and getting mad for not getting their tickets and boarding passes.   Many people had meetings and important things to do including me :) and one more thing , they never give meals or they literally take it from people while they're eating because: we are landing in a bit , well, this shows how this ""famous"" airlines lacks professionalism."

After writing a detailed email i received a poorly written email from Shaima who got some of the facts wrong. We have 8 people but in their reply they are only compensating 5 passengers instead of 8 despite having all passengers luggage delayed. I have requested for someone from higher management to relook into my case but this was also ignored. We have travelled with sri lankan airlines, malaysia airlines, singapore airlines, thai airways and some budget airlines previously. Emirates has been the worst. Imagine rude staff, delay luggage, damage luggage and inappropriate email reply.

Food was appalling - a focaccia snack wasn't defrosted and was inedible, the actual meals entirely forgettable. And to be told that food choices were restricted because they 'had run out of the popular dishes' says a great deal about just how sloppy service was. Staff on the flight out of Amsterdam were great, for the other 3 flights the staff should have remedial training. A complaint to Emirates got a disinterested pro-forma response. If thinking of flying business class, go elsewhere - you can do so much better than this!"

If you have a Qantas codeshare booking on Emirates expect to be as far back in the bottom level   even if you are Qantas gold members.  Also expect that your seat selection made prior to flying will be changed and the worst seats allocated to Qantas members.

Emirates,10-Oct,,"14 February,",,The best $900 I have ever spent was at JFK airport to upgrade to Business Class on this flight to Dubai.  The special was too good to refuse after the flight over.  There is just no way for a tall person to squeeze into one of Emirates Economy seats in the 777.  The A380 may be a different story.  In Business the staff were pleasant and the service great.  The worst thing that happened was they didn't have any female amenities wetbags for my wife so she got a male one instead (oh the things we have to put up with).  Can't fault anything else.
Emirates,9-Oct,ar,"22 November,",,"I flew Perth to Amsterdam via Dubai on the 777. The seating was squashed in and with the very narrow aisles everytime some one went past you you were bumped. Do not chose aisle seats on this plane if you want to sleep. The service from the crew and the food was excellent. Far better than other airlines I have flown with lately. The ICE entertainment system is one of the best out there and the cameras outside the plane make takeoffs and landings interesting. The return trip to Perth was on the A380. What a difference,  the A380 is amazing. The seating was good, the aisles wider and it's so quiet. Again the service from the crew and the food was top notch. I would recommend flying Emirates, but try to fly on the A380 and give the 777 a miss."
Emirates,10-Oct,ar,"12 June,",,"A380: London - Dubai. The superb quality in the air was not matched by organisation on the ground. The design of the business class cabin imposes some limitations on seating - thus I was separated from my wife and a family of five was even worse off, being spread over two sections of the cabin. Once Emirates gets on top of the logistics and provides a good all round experience, it will be hard to beat. (Made Qantas look very shabby indeed.)"

I went once by Jet airways to Singapore and it was an awesome experience but by Emirates it wasn't as classy as they boast it is. My trip to Bangkok and Hong Kong last week was a trauma, or i'd say a nightmare I still cant get over, with them misplacing my luggage - on both flights - back to back and then in Bangkok it wasn't delivered until I had to leave the country, when i got it from their departure counter just in time to leave the country. In Hong Kong, they misplaced it (""erroneously"" according to the response of the customer service staff) only to have it delivered the next day to my hotel. Also, their customer service staff is irrational and do not respond in time to queries unless few email reminders are sent to them.
Besides, I'd personally never recommend Hong Kong at all, since Emirates does not have a counter there to attend to baggage misplaced by them, it is outsourced to an agency (Jardine services) who don't speak English properly. "

Emirates,8-Oct,ar,"21 July,",,"EK 422 | Dubai - Perth | B777-300ER 

Emirates (EK) have increased their services to Perth this winter, matching Singapore Airlines as being a popular choice in travelling to Europe/America. Business class travel is always costly but relative to Asian carriers Singapore Airlines (SQ) & Cathay Pacific (CX), Emirates are very reasonably priced. 
Despite a cheaper fare, EK's business class experience was just as good as SQ's. The 777-300ER has a 2-3-2 configuration however there is plenty of privacy in the comfortable lie-flat seat. The seat itself and great entertainment system called ICE is controlled by a touch screen device which activates the popular massage feature in the chair.
Unlike the often slow SQ cabin crew, EK were efficient and warm in their service. They were a worldly crew which catered for all passengers needs. They also handed out a stylish toiletries bag - a nice touch - something SQ discontinued sometime ago. Their dining service was also better than that on SQ where each meal consisted of a choice of two starters, three mains and two desserts - all of which were high quality
The Boeing 777-300ER with registration A6-EGO entered service in 2012 and was a brilliant aircraft. Perfectly maintained and brand new, the plane was quiet as well. The overhead bins provided plenty of room for carry-on luggage and added to the highly spacious cabin. 
Would fly with them again in a heartbeat."

Business trip 2 pers - own bubble. We were allocated 2 seats in a block of 3.

Asked twice to move what was refused by the cabin crew because of, understand who can, ""Covid regulations"". So 6.5h at 40cm from an unknown (otherwise friendly) person, where dozens of places were available that did meet the social distancing conditions. I can understand that the software check-in system makes a mistake when allocating the seats, but it is unimaginable that the cabin crew refuses to let the passengers run less risks. To avoid other passengers having to suffer the same fate, complaint filled out via the site, but unfortunately only received a marketing response with the message that Emirates respects the social distancing rules as much as possible and that they do everything they can to  protect the health of the passengers, which in this case is 2x totally incorrect. It is unfortunate that Emirates does not even recognize the problem and therefore nothing will be done about it."

Emirates airlines are really good in Window dressing when it comes to their Customer Service. At first sight it looks like they're really value their (loyal) customers but unfortunately in reality they don't live up to the expectations they promise to the world.

I've been flying with Emirates many times before and also reached their Silver Member Status so you can call me experienced when it comes to this airline. The plane itself, the seats and the food provided are OK.

Only when it comes to how they treat their (loyal) customers it becomes a complete different story. Once you've ordered and paid for your ticket they loose their complete interest in you as a customer. They treat you like a number and the only feedback you get are the lines that were written out in their ""Customer"" scripts. 

This resulted for me to the (unfortunate) decision to use the Emirates services in the future and look for other airlines which provide proper Customer Service "

Emirates,3-Oct,Oliver de Bono,"30 August,",,"Certainly not the Emirates of the last decade, i fly quite regularly with this airline both Business and Economy and can say things have gone down hill greatly. Firstly prices are sky high compared to many other long distant airlines, planes have become dated and in serious need of TLC, food is mediocre at best but operations are the worst, excess seating costs, delays, and now seating allocation problems. Not to mention when connecting through Dubai emirates wants to save time on moving the planes so passengers are made to wait nearly one hour before entering the gate do due the planes parking for the night and slow transit to the gate, its a very uncomfortable experience and i would recommend to any first time connecting passengers to avoid Emirates Dubai connection at any cost."

A $400 return airfare from Sydney to Singapore was an irresistible opportunity to visit a friend on a business trip there. All aspects of the check-in & boarding process were very good. On the Sydney-Singapore sector, the flight was probably only half full, so the extra room around me made up for the really uncomfortable seats on the 787-9. With no TV's, the only entertainment is whatever you bring onboard or the iPad's you can hire. I bought a 24 hour internet package and have to say I was blown away by how quick it was. The under seat power charging for an additional USD5 was also very useful. About the only irritating aspect of the Scoot aircraft is the placement of the buttons that operate the light & call button. Being right on the top of the armrest, I kept accidentally pressing the call button.

Had good departure time from Singapore, which is why I chose to travel with them (as well as the great price). 
Was disappointed at the price of a bottle of small water. There also seemed to be plenty of empty rows, where no one was offered (or allowed maybe?)to be shifted to, if there row was full up.
Would definitely fly with scoop again, if price and schedule was right."

Unfortunately, counter and call centre staff need much room for improvement for their work morale and attitude. Are they generally disgruntled to serve customers from Singapore?

Scoot,9-Oct,ar,"27 April,",,Flight Perth to Singapore return. Delay of 2 hours on the way over with no text / email notification which was a little frustrating (mainly because Perth international airport is so boring). Seats were comfortable with adequate leg room for me ( Although I am short) but you should book extra leg room if you are tall. Plenty of opportunity to purchase food and beverages  during the flight at what I thought were reasonable costs. Plenty of overhead room for bags etc. But what I really enjoyed was that on both flights the pilots came over the speaker to explain why the seat belt signs were put back on and how long they estimated they would remain - This goes a long way with assisting those of us who are nervous flyers (there were at least 3 of us sitting in close proximity to each other but not travelling together). Would love to fly on this plane again (super quiet with amazingly smooth take off).
Scoot,2-Oct,,"21 November,",,"We boarded our plane to Singapore and had to wait on board for 2 hours due to technical difficulties. The flight was then cancelled as there were not the appropriate staff or parts available to fix the issue, and the night time departure curfew had been reached in Sydney.

We were going on this trip for a long weekend, so when they could not reschedule our flight until the day we were due to return, we were offered a refund for this one-way part of the flight. We had to re-book flights with another airline at the airport which Scoot then would not reimburse us for, or for the loss of pre-paid parking fees. We did have comprehensive travel insurance, however almost no policies on the market will cover for mechanical failure of an aircraft that leads to a delay or cancellation (which I didn't know!). Scoot did not reschedule the flight for the next morning, communicate with any of the stranded passengers at the airport, or prove at all helpful in the months following when we tried over MANY phone calls to follow up. Don't fly with this company. If they cancel your flight there is no skin off their nose - but you'll have a costly nightmare on your hands - regardless of whether you have travel insurance or not."
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"23 April,",,"Scoot No Good
While the fare was quite good, and the staff were good fun everything else was rated lacklustre to just plain bad. Add to this that all 4 flights I have flown have all been late means I won't fly them again."
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"17 March,",,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced!
Our flight was delayed 6 hours which meant we would miss our connecting flight so we took the option to cancel and receive a refund. We were advised it would take 3 to 4 weeks to receive the refund. Well it is now 10 weeks and I'm still waiting and every time I call customer service I receive a robotic response that the refund takes 6 to 8 weeks! When I asked to speak to a manager I was placed on hold for 20 mins only for the staff member to tell me the supervisor was on lunch! Absolutely disgusting "
Scoot,0 / 10,Kyle Delaney,"12 November,",,"They got me to check in online and then told me I had to go to the counter anyway, even though I wasn't checking any luggage. They should really tell people ahead of time that they can't get an online boarding pass or use a kiosk, so they don't waste their time trying :("
Scoot,9-Oct,ar,"01 February,",,"Excellent Flights, both trips to and from Singapore.  Flight attendants were attentive and greeted me all the time with my last name, which is very seldom even in some full service airlines.  

Flights attendants were so attentive that they even asked for my preference in when to have my meals as that was a midnight flight and woke me just in time for my meals before touch down.  

Water was offered once on board, within seconds on both legs, even without asking.  

Can't ask for anything more, except for a priority check in lane at Singapore gate for security check.  

Scoot is always my favourite on LCCs, even when compared to certain full service carriers like Cathay Pacific.  To me, CX is more like a LCC nowadays than to Scoot.  

Wifi on board is another reason why I am choosing Scoot. "
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"05 December,",,"I travelled very frequently with Scoot airline to any country that Scoot covered. The last bad experienced I had with scoot team and insurance that I''ve bought travelclaims.sg@acegroup.com that is link with Scoot airline was unacceptable response from them regards for 8 hours delayed from Singapore. That my claim was unsuccessful due to that it was not mechanical/ structure defect. 
I am very disapoointed with Sccot team airline as I am a fan of Scoot and strongly recommend to my family and friends regardless the airline always delayed for 3 hrs. But now, I am not sure to continuing travel with scoot."
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"07 March,",,Flight was schedule to leave Syd 27/2 13:45 hrs local time. Flight delayed until 16:45hrs same day. The Customer Call center told me to check in 3 hrs before the actual schedule time 13:45hrs. This is the second occasion that I had experience flight delays up to 2-3 hrs. There were other passengers on connecting flight with other Airlines in Singapore and they are very frustrated because they loss their tickets on the connecting flight from Singapore. Don't fly SCOOT or you lose your loot.
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"06 December,",,"Completely unacceptable food (only one meal in 7.5 hours and that was a tiny effort with fatty meat and nothing substantial plus a Toblerone), one drink in 7.5 hours, a seat wih no footrest, the curtain draped over me (seat 11D) so everytime a passenger went to the toilet it woke me, no effective priority boarding (only one line), no priority bags, no in flight entertainment unless one had an iPod, no newspaper, no cushion, no blanket and the economy passengers got off before us all adds up to the most unsatisfactory so-called business flight I have ever taken on my flights from Bangkok-Singapore-Coolangata. I would have got better service for cheaper price travelling on Thai or Singapore economy. It will be the last time I fly on Scoot, which should be called Skeleton instead because that is what it is - a bare bones service.
EDITORS COMMENT: we are reviewing Scoot Business class in January so will look out for these things "
Scoot,2-Oct,Georgia Matthews,"18 January,",,I had the most abysmal experience with Scoot at every interaction including before the flight (cancelled 1 day before and no other flights available except their partner company Singapore airlines which was $500AUD more). On the flight there is no water available for free (12 hour flight) until I complained and stated it is actually illegal and the airline host told me to be quiet and game me a small bottle. And after the flight (still going on and it has been over 6 months...) I have been emailing Scoot customer service and they have refused to provide a complaints avenue so I have succumbed to my first ever online review because of the level of disappointment and fury I have with Scoot.
Scoot,2-Oct,mick tobor,"15 April,",,"Our Scoot Nightmare in nine shocks (part 1)

shock 1: On our way to Bangkok airport we received a voucher for the cancelled fligfht home!
shock 2: A new internet booking for 9.000 baht isnâ€™t possible, instead we have to buy an overprized ticket for 21.000 baht!
shock 3: After buying the overprized ticket they didnâ€™t want to let us fly! We showed an email from the Greek ministery of foreign affairs (mfa) giving green light for my wife - and they checked us through to athens.
shock 4: In Singapore Scoot denied boarding to my korean wife (not me). we tried to show the mfa email, they didnâ€™t want to see it."
Scoot,7-Oct,,"02 January,",,"Service was good. Seat was really really uncomfortable though. The price was reasonable for business class. The CAs were friendly. Food wasn`t bad, better than JAL`s business. The seat though was really really hard. It was difficult to sleep or relax. It was about the same as Air Asia`s economy class. I`m not sure I would fly again on Scoot or not."
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"21 December,",,I bought a ticket from Melbourne to Singapore. Payment through their Poli System and had no proof of my payment but the funds were taken out of my account. I called customer service and their only solution was to wait 24 hours - by that time the flight would have left. They did not allow me to speak to a supervisor nor did they produce any solutions. I am now chasing the company for follow up and credit to my account. 
Scoot,6-Oct,ar,"06 October,",,"Definitely affordable air travel from Perth to Singapore (cheaper than traveling interstate in Australia) however for a five hour Trip you would most likely need to have a meal... And this is where it goes downhill ""all ""the food we saw coming off the food cart including the 2 disgusting meals we bought and took one mouthful- yuk and overpriced. Unfortunately we spent the next few hours into the flight hungry - I recommend take your own food - obviously food quality and taste is not a priority to Scoot Airlines 

EDITORS COMMENT: Scoot are fantastic but the in flight catering does need an overhaul"
Scoot,4-Oct,,"23 February,",,"This review is solely about the price Scoot charged me for a one way flight from Phuket to Perth last week. I was ill in Thailand and had to return home early. Scoot had no customer care or support at the airport - they gave me 3 different phone numbers to ring and none of them answered. Their email address also did not work as it would take up to 10 days to receive an answer. Next day, Scoot charged me 3 times the normal amount to return home. In total, I had to pay them 23,700 bahts to change my flight and in addition to the flight which I had originally booked and did not use - 7,800 bahts, I ended up 31,500 bahts poorer or AUS$1,278 for a one way flight to Perth from Phuket. Do not think about using this airline if you need to change your flights and it will be the first and last time I will ever use them."
Scoot,9-Oct,ar,"16 March,",,"I am a frequent traveller from HKG to SIN, for both business and leisure.  I flew on their 777 a few years back and up to now, I am still a loyal customer of Scoot.  It is even better than Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines but of course, you get what you paid for.  

My last trip with them was in Mar 2015, on a B787 Dreamliner.  Only one word Excellent.  The cabin was spacious, the seats were great.  Probably it was an overnight flight, so the flight attendants simply switched the cabin lights off, went back to their place and no one was disturbing me for the whole flight.  Who cares for food on a 3.5 hour flight?  Getting a can of coke in the air for just S$4 isn't too much, is it? The lightings were great and energetic.  The crews were friendly, lively and handsome.  

The wifi on board at such a cheap rate was another plus.  I can stay connected with my friends and family.  No one even knew I was 41,000 feet above the sea!

Thanks to their cheap rates, I can now see my friends in Singapore like once every month.  Look for their special promotion, it can be as cheap as HKD$99 for a single trip!  Amazing airline, thanks to the hard work from everyone on the Scoot team!"
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"31 May,",,"Flew from Singapore to Perth on 29 May 2017.  This is the first time I have flown with Scoot and I found the experience quite pleasing. I know it is a budget airline and you get what you pay for, so you actually choose your own level. I paid extra for a bigger seat which I am glad about. I did not pre order a meal but I did purchase one on board just to see what they were like - typical airline food. I found the drinks (beer) was very expensive. Overall it was good for the price - I will travel again with Scoot. "
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"01 December,",,"Uncomfortable seats, crew that don't care and schedules that they don't care about. Simply the worst airline I have ever travelled on. Never again."
Scoot,3-Oct,,"20 September,",,Be Warned don't fly Scoot! Stay away it's not worth it! Lost our baggage 4 weeks not 1 call from them . And calling them you need to wait 20mins just to get through to anyone and then you get told you need to call Singapore airport FROM AUSTRALIA! So unprofessional its ridiculous. Not to mention the I don't give a shit attitude from start to finish from the check-in counter to the staff on the plane but most of all the so-called customer service. They lost half the planes baggage and then you need to chase it up by calling Singapore as it's not there problem. Are YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME! 5 weeks into this issue and been lied to repeatedly and treated like this is my fault. Never once was nasty to anyone but now they refuse to find it so its my mission over the next few months to warn people on every website I can find about there terrible customer service and half-ass airline!
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"13 January,",,"Purchased a more expensive ticket for their 'scoot in silence' seats which promises an adult-only zone which is silent so you can sleep. However my and my wife's seat was directly next to the toilet, and consequently the queue, the flush and the banging door. It was actually the noisiest flight I've ever had. I complained and was told there was nothing they could do.

I've also added up the money I save by the cheaper ticket, and with all the other hidden charges it would have been cheaper to fly with a better airline. Yes, they are a budget airline, but there are some things which shouldn't cost money, such as good service. When our plane was boarding, the staff were just talking to each other and a huge amount of people were confused and not even sure what was happening.

The food is also terrible - we paid for two teas (yes you have to pay even for tea), and they bought two foam cups and handed us two tea bags. We asked for milk, and got a strange look, and eventually someone came back with powdered milk sachets. 

DO NOT USE."
Scoot,4-Oct,Judi Rimmer,"04 May,",,"Had a great Singapore Airlines experience last year flying Sydney to Heathrow via Changi so booked with them again for March 2023.
E ticket stated 4 flights with Singapore Airlines but Sydney to Changi turned out to be Scoot.
Very bad experience. Old plane with hard seats and no cushion.Arm rest broken and patched with sellotape. One poor quality, complimentary meal and drink and after that everything had to be paid for, even drinking water. No inflight entertainment. This was an 8 hour flight!!
Arrived at Changi feeling tired and uncomfortable, with another 14 hour flight ahead of me.Would not have booked if I'd known."
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"25 November,",,"The order web site is the worst I v ever seen. They try to sell anything.

My first (and the last) experience with Scoot can't be worse. My flight has been delayed for 6 hours, but the customer service guys were so inpatient to hear my complains. I booked the night flight and planned to sleep on plane, so that meal and drink was not pre-ordered. However the flight was delayed till the second day which became a day flight lasts for 8 hours without meal and drink.

Despite my wasted car rental on the second day due to flight delay, I only asked for free drinks and meal as compensation. The customer service even did not want to have a try to request for me but just said ""no we cant do it"". They even asked me to cancel my flight and they will compensate 20 dollars administration fees....

by AU and US regulation, in any case, if it is delayed by more than 3 hours, meal should be provided. I am not sure where can we claim in Asia."
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"08 April,",,"Crap, crap, crap!!! We had a wonderful holiday in Singapore. Scoot was the only part of our holiday that we regret. I'll spare you the details, but the 5 hour delay (...BOTH WAYS ) we had (...which our travel agent didn't even know about) was not the end of it; the bad stomach upset we both had on our return following our meal on the flight sums up our experience pretty well. If you're contemplating a trip to Singapore with Scoot ... DONT DO IT!! This is without s doubt the worst airline (... budget or otherwise) we have ever experienced. CRAP!!"
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"25 March,",,"Scoot was a very enjoyable carrier. I would definitely recommend booking with them when they have a sale on, if they fly to your destination. It is infact cheaper to fly from Perth to Sydney via Singapore on Scoot, then it is to go direct. Took a flight from Perth-SIN-Perth on 777. 

If you do book with scoot, I recommend you book in the Scoot In Silence section of the aircraft. It is like the premium economy section of a premium carrier like Qantas. It is rows 21-25 of the aircraft. It includes so much legroom, more than I have ever had in any economy class flights, and you have the advantage of the meals being brought to you before the rest of the plane, as you are seated up the front of the aircraft. The cabin crew were very friendly, I thought their service was comparable to the likes of Emirates, they smile a lot, always doing their job as efficiently as possible. If you are on a long flight I recommend eating prior to the flight because the meals are a little small. I was able to keep myself entertained with my own music and magazines, I assume it is better now with in-flight wifi, but again recommend taking books, magazines or anything to entertain yourself in your carry-on."
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"07 April,",,"To everyone out there. Don't fly with scoot. I had buy my ticket on the 17 March, and I choose not to have travel insurance. Somehow, after I paid for it, there was insurance add on to my account. I called them up right after I found out, which is 2:10 am Melbourne time. the girl on the phone said she will get me back my refund, but this will take 6 to 8 week. I wasn't happy about this, but I guess they give me back my money, so better than nothing.

When I call them up 2 days ago, asked has the refund been processing yet, I got told there was no refund record on the system, and I had missed out on the 7 days cooling period, so nothing they can do about it. I asked them, is this meant I been forced to buy this insurance, they said ""Yes""...........
after talking for other 30 mins, they agree to find out the record of my first called to them about the insurance which I had given them the time and day I call. And scoot said they will get back to me with 24 to 48 hr.

but as we all know, they never call again.

DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME AND MONEY ON THIS COMPANY

p.s they had charged me 2 times for seat selection fee, due to an error on their system, I asked them about it, so they put it a"
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"21 October,",,"Worst airline experience I've had to date. Never even made the flight. After going through an online checkout process riddled with hidden upsells (including trying to get you to pay for selecting your seat), I paid for my flight. I immediately realized that I had made a booking error, which was totally my fault: the time was for 2:25AM, not PM.

I called them immediately (minutes later), and they wouldn't budge on refunding. Not only that, they wouldn't let me change my destinations, and their only flight schedule for BKK to TPE was between 2:25AM and 3:50AM, for the foreseeable future!!!

I was on the phone for an hour. They were completely unhelpful and unwilling to make an exception in the name of good customer service. I will never recommend this airline to anyone. Ridiculous."
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"25 December,",,"Called the scoot call centre to discuss changes to my bookings. Worst call centre i have ever engaged with in over 20 plus years of flying with different airlines. I believe its in Philippines or managed by phillipinos. Poor communication and listening skills. Spoke with 2 different operators( one claimed her name was Sachie and the other i didnt even waste time with as she was abosultely a terrible customer officer) both were equally bad. I will never ever be recommending Scoot to any of my friends or family. I would rather pay slightly more and take another budget airlines that a
provides better customer service and experience."
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"30 September,",,"I have taken several Scoot flights over the last couple of years.  Overall, each flight rated above average.  However, I had to cancel my recent flight on compassionate ground and this is when the nightmare started.  An airline must also be rated on the way it manages issues outside SOP and when genuine clients are in need.  The company hides behind its call centre and does not have a channel to alleviate complaints.  It has been almost 3 weeks since my initial contact, with my numerous follow up, about the cancellation.  To date, the issue has not been resolved.  In case you need to go through my experience, you need to take a full swig of the patience potion and hope that you don't suffer from hypertension.  Upon receiving the request, Scoot advises that it would again be submitted for further evaluation and subjected to approval.   To add fuel to fire, they asked for further patience as their process could take up to additional 8 weeks due to their large volume of requests.  Note the irony.  Before booking a flight on Scoot, read the fine print - refund is in the form of a transferable travel voucher valid for 6 months, irrespective of your circumstance.

EDITORS COMMENT: As frustrating and unfair as this seems, this would be the case for 90 per cent of carriers if you were traveling on the cheapest -non flexible- fare.  These fares are great - it means we can all travel more but don't expect a refund or any compensation of you need to change your plans no matter what the circumstances. "
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"30 May,",,"This airline is just one of the kind. Like i have never seen an airline this unfair and unorganised. 
I travelled from Singapore to Melbourne on late January. Flight at 12:40am. I arrived at gate 12:20 and they did not let me in. They hold the plane till 1am to find my luggage and throw it out. All they said was sorry you missed your flight. I showed them the time as in i have 20 minutes left and they were like,NO you have to be at the gate 45 minutes before and that is the rule. they passed me through the flyscoot office to collect my bag. I went to their airline office to seek help and the girl sitting behind the counter talking on the mobile phone with the headphone as in i am not available. After 5 minutes of chat on the mobile phone i explained the situation and she calmly responded: SORRY WE CAN NOT DO ANYTHING AT THIS STAGE AND YOU MISSED YOUR FLIGHT. you have to buy a new ticket back for tomorrow. 45 Minutes later, someone took me to immigration to stamp entry again to Singapore in order to receive my check in bag. They said we can not pass you your bag in transit so you have to enter Singapore and receive your bag after immigration. Even immigration officer was surprised.

EDITORS COMMENT: This is not a specific to Scoot. Cut off times at Changi airport are not 20 minutes and to be fair all the signs through the airport do say final call etc. It is ridiculous to delay the plane so your bag can be found we agree but we can assure you that this is a Singapore Airport thing."
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"22 October,",,"On a recent flight on Scoot, my baggage got lost, during Transit at Singapore. I had paid $40 for  their service called 'Scoot-thru', wherein one's baggage is checked through if you are connecting to another flight. So the least one would expect if your baggage gets lost, is that they return the charge I paid for the checked in baggage service. But instead of getting anything in return the letter states that the fact I got my baggage after a few days means that they have delivered the service. So with no heed to the inconvenience caused I am another delightful profit provider. I really liked Scoot till now, moving forward i am not sure.

EDITORS COMMENT: yeah that's a bit wrong!! They should refund that really "
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,"Customer Service is non existent, call centre takes a long time to get through to, then staff have difficulty understanding, promise to escalate the issue, give timelines to get back to me & never do & there is no other way to contact them.  I even lodged a complaint through the feedback service on their website, received a computer generated email saying they would get back to me in 10 business days and they never did.  I paid for 24 WiFi services for all 4 passengers on a recent flight from Gold Coast to Singapore.  The cost was $AUD30 per passenger.  We never received the promised email with log on details, which was supposed to come 24 hours prior to the flight.  After calling Scoot call centre, I was provided with 1 log on user name and password.  I questioned the Scoot agent twice about each passenger needing their own log on details.  I was assured that as we were on the same booking number we would only need 1 log in. When we were on the flight, only 1 passenger could log in, as we ALL NEEDED A LOG ON user name & password. I have asked for a refund for the 3 passengers and have received nothing - customer service say they will escalate and get back to me, but they never do."
Scoot,5-Oct,celine lef,"11 March,",,The worst customer service ever !!!! paid 17kgs extra luggage one month ago. Then they put me on a Singapore airline flight from Singapore to Sydney. Singapore Airlines then told me they had no access to the info from Scoot so they made me pay all the excess again. Now waiting after 7 calls and promises for a refund of the 17kgs paid and NOONE responds. Each email of customer service has been closed. Never seen such a disaster service ever !!!!
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"07 January,",,"Scoot is very good low cost carrier compared to likes of air asia. Their 777 service is very well thought out and being a bigger wide body jet it is quite comfortable. 

Flight crew was very friendly but looked very inexperienced. 

Overall very satisfied as you get what you pay."
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"18 November,",,"We travelled Scoot business class Gold Coast to Singapore return.  As this is a low budget airline we were not expecting  any extra services & found payment for drinks etc quite acceptable. Yes travelling Singapore airlines as we have previously is vastly different but the convenience of leaving & returning to the Gold Coast  not having to travel via Brisbane/Sydney is the perfect fit! Meals were acceptable budget airline food.  The cabin crew were courteous & obliging why do people expect extra's on these airlines you made the decision to fly with them!  We thought the return fare for Business Class was reasonable and we will certainly be using them again living an hour from the airport suits us shame  more International locations are not available yet.   You get what you pay for!!!!
EDITORS COMMENT: They're excellent value for money when you're expectations are realistic - like you said, they're a low cost carrier! Thanks for the great review."

Today is the 19th of June , she no voucher ? This would have to be the worse experience of my life ! Disgraceful Scoot !"
Scoot,6-Oct,,"22 September,",,"Flew PER - SIN 13th September and SIN - PER 20th September. Both flights were on -time, pretty smooth flying going to Singapore, flight actually arrived early. Not a big fan of their new departure time from Perth @9.30pm, however the departure time for the return flight from Singapore @ 3.00pm is a good time. We flew in ""Scoot in Silence"" both ways. The advantage is supposed to be more quiet due to no kids under 12 years of age. Doesn't stop you getting adults sitting behind you kicking your seat though. They do allow Scoot in silence passengers to disembark before other economy passengers. My meal going to Singapore was the braised chicken with rice, I didn't really enjoy it that much, but I'm not too keen on airline food anyway.The meal on SIN -PER was Roasted Chicken thigh with honey garlic sauce which was a lot tastier. My husband enjoyed his Nasi Lemak meal. Tried to use Scoot TV on way home but had an issue with the credit card processing so gave up. You have to download the Scoot APP before you fly and then log on to Scoot wifi to access the payment screen. There's not a lot of newer movies to watch, mainly ones that already on Foxtel or Netflix. Leg room was fine for me, I'm 170cm. For taller people, the stretch seats would probably be better. The staff were great on both flights with Captain or First Officer keeping passengers informed at beginning and before descending. Yes I would fly Scoot again, just wished they arrived in Singapore a little bit earlier."

shock 6: No service, no food, no water, no help at all - while waiting more than 6 hours!
shock 7: Our luggage is not available - itâ€™s behind immigration counters. If we go out, weâ€™ll be quarantined for 14 days.
shock 8: The Scoot manager is kidding us: We need a medical certificate, we would get it in a clinic nearby. But this clinic doesnâ€™t test anyone - and the manager should know it.
shock 9: No flight money back! The manager was generous enough to give us the flight to Bangkok (instead of Athens). We could hardly remain cool.

No shock, almost expected: Since march 20 Scoot didnâ€™t refund anything, doesnâ€™t answer emails."

Contacted customer service to book as she is 17 yrs old, asked if she would need a letter as an ""unaccompanied minor"" and they said yes. At Sydney airport they refused her to travel as she was unaccompanied and as of September 2016 rules had changed that passengers had to be over 18 unless travelling with  an adult (ticket was booked in November 2016). I have been now waiting over 10 weeks to receive a refund and keep getting the run around. Unbelievable bad service and would never recommend or travel with them again."

I have received email and SMS saying that there is 3 hours flight delay due to technical issue and flight started 3.5 hours late in sydney. By the time i reached singapore my hyderabad flight check in is closed and tiger ground staff booked me next flight which is after 24 hours. There is no accommodation nor compensation offered as flight delay was less than 4 hours. I have to pay my accommodation and food and wait 24 hours in singapore transit hotel. I have traveled next day to hyderabad and to my surprise my checked in baggage didn't arrive. I paid scoot thru and they are supposed to transfer my luggage to my next flight. I have written a complaint in hyderabad airport and left. till today i didn't recieve any call from ground staff about my luggage. i have tried 50 time to the numbers provided on PIR. Phone is either engaged or disconnected after few rings. Not sure what should i do now to get ac my luggage. 
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"26 July,",,"My experience with Scoot was disgraceful. 

I do not understand why this blog does not post reviews about delays, as Scoot delayed us by 22hrs which is extremely significant.

Regardless, the attitude of the company and staff on the ground was woeful. After more than six hours of delay with no answers or information regarding the next available plane, fellow passengers and I had to literally demand that they organise us accommodation. These staff members were some of the simplest forms of human beings I have ever come across, and there was no management on the ground to support them, nor would anyone higher up answer when we could physically leave the airport. 

After nearly 20 hours, many of us became so desperate for answers (after a second delayed flight) that we had to ask our loved ones to call the Singapore Airlines hotline in our home countries. My mother did this for me and SA had no idea what was happening to us, so they contacted Scoot Airlines to find out more information about the next flight, but were met with barbaric service and were hung up on.

The cheap prices are enticing but when you lose $$$ accommodation at your next destination, its just not worth it."
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"21 June,",,Not bad for a low cost carrier especially the option of different classes onbord are appreciated even business class is not the same as a proper business class but having the private cabin and the seat in front of the plane is well worth the small extra cost
Scoot,10-Oct,ar,"23 September,",,Awesome flight from Gold Coast to Singapore then conection with tiger air to phuket made easy with scoot through.  Travelling with two kids aged 10 and 12 drama free is almost un heard of but for us flying with scoot we had no issues at all. Lets hope our return flight on 26th sep from phuket to Gold coast is jyst as good.
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"06 March,",,"Scoot is the worst budget airline I have flown with. Its ground staff/baggage enquiry staff at Changi Singapore airport are very unhelpful. I purchased extra baggage up to 35kg for SGD88 online and when I was successful in paying for an upgrade to ScootBiz with 30kg of checked baggage, Scoot luggage enquiry manager informed me that I had to purchase another 40kg of checked baggage when my combined luggage weighed about 40kg which will cost me another SGD100 online and another SGD150 at the check in counter. There was no other option to just purchase an extra 5kg online. Since I had already paid for the 35kg in addition to the free 30kg in Scootbiz, it is reasonable to expect that 40kg is not over the allowable weight limit but no, Scoot ground luggage staff informed me that I had to purchase the 40kg for another SGD100. This is daylight robbery! Inflight service in Scootbiz was equally lousy. You had to pay for everything. No change of drink once the order had been keyed in by the flight attendant and no free blanket or socks. You need to pay for all those necessities! If you read the information on Scoot website, you get a different impression. Misleading advertising!!!"
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"31 January,",,"Travelled business class from Singapore to Melbourne. It doesn't feel lime business class at all. No drinks were offered,  not even water. Had to pay for everything including blanket. No tv,  had to pay for online movies using our own devices. Food was disgusting. 

EDITORS COMMENT: As per our editor reviews on this site, Scootbiz is a low cost 'business class' its basically like a basic economy. I wish you had of seen the review first so you were not left disappointed as it's very different to business class as most people know it. "
Scoot,9-Oct,ar,"06 March,",,"We flew Scootbiz, Melbourne-Singapore return. 
The Dreamliner planes were so new and we loved our big, roomy and comfortable seats, especially good for my big, tall son.   
Our pre-booked meals were all good quality. We also bought snacks and drinks that were good and cheaper than we expected . 
The crews were very friendly, informative and very attentive.

On our 1st flight they wore dress-ups and played a Valentines Day game which included passengers from throughout the plane. This was fun and raised plenty of laughs. 
The crew chattered  to passengers and looked happy in their job. (Very different to some other airlines!!)
Scootbiz is 'no frills' business class so you do need to pay extra for 'extras'  such as wifi, blankets, extra meals and drinks.
 But you do  get so much included in the very cheap flight costs including a choice of meals, drinks,  tv channels, 30kg check in luggage and 15 kg carry on with big comfortable seat with great service from the crew was which is  ALL included in the advertised fare. 
We were 100% satisfied with our Scootbiz experience and the great value for money. We will definitely fly Scoot again."
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"12 September,",,Gold Coast to Singapore scootbiz was excellent. Will fly again.
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"04 January,",,"I cannot understand why a budget airlines has a Business Class esp. when it gives ""Business"" class such a bad name.
35 passengers sharing 1 toilet.  Seat was wider and a little more legroom, but recline was about the same as Economy, and worse not electrically but self powered.  Flight Attendants not interested to help my kids push down.
No Australia Entry forms. 
Return flight on Econ.  1 hour flight delay.  Another hour to get onto flight, 45 mins on the tarmac under strong sun.  Got on board and policy NOT to provide even water -- for their tardiness and lack of organization.  Ordered a Cup Noodle (5$). They took my cash and promptly forgot.  3 hours later I ask for it, they ask to see my receipt. I told them they didn't give me one. They suggested that without a receipt, they can't verify what I really ordered.  I told them thats fine -- I'm diabetic and I'll pay another $5 to avoid going into diabetic coma if they insisted on the position that their passengers would scam them of a paltry $5.
They brought the noodles thereafter but made me feel like it was charity.
No concept of hospitality.  "
Scoot,9-Oct,ar,"09 March,",,"Incredible service. The dreamliner aircraft has beautiful clean air and the windows are really big. Scoot has really good value for money and the culture onboard the aircraft is really fun and social. Love the scoot biz class too! Flew that too.

EDITORS COMMENT: We agree!"
Scoot,10-Oct,ar,"14 March,",,"We wish to congratulate Scoot on the compassion they showed to a family travelling with a disabled son on our flight from Singapore to Perth today. They kept passengers advised of the situation and tried to make up time lost during the flight. We were very impressed. Our flight was comfortable and staff were very efficient and friendly. Thank you Scoot. 

EDITORS COMMENT: Thanks for sharing such a positive story."
Scoot,2-Oct,Marcelo Bueno,"26 July,",,"I couldn't add any luggage in the website. And there, the price was about 15 Us. They ask you to go to the check in and do there directly. But.... At the check in, the price was 70us for 20 kg! Almost the ticket price! I asked for the same price, but the attended were so rude and treat me like a stupid! Looking for my passport and embarrassing me! Terrible experience for me and my son... He was so scared! Never more! Wrong twice: to obligate me to pay a unfair price and be aggressive with me and my family!"
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"18 June,",,During POLi transaction payment on 22 Apr 2017 flight booking my page got disconnected and I was asked to do a card payment by customer service team to continue with booking. I was given an assurance that the earlier POLi transaction would be refunded. But it has been 8 weeks now and even after several calls to customer service I haven't received my refund. I am thinking of going to consumer court if my refund is not done by end of this week.
Scoot,6-Oct,ar,"30 January,",,"I recently travelled Scoot from Singapore to Perth.

I was fairly excited to travel with them as they have boasted flying the new 787 Dreamliner.  I had booked their business class to have the extra room, luggage and meal.  Now I realise this is a cheap offshoot SIA, however this near new plane was in pretty shabby condition, honestly the interior looked like a plane of ten years old, pen marks all over seats, grubby walls and carpets, it was a real disappointment.

The immediate thing I noticed is noise levels, I had a few days  earlier flown from Hong Kong to Singapore on Cathay on an A330, they are much quieter aircraft, so I don't understand the claim from Boeing, the so called tinting glass rather than shades you pull down are a gimmick, they dont work, they only block 80% of light and they give off a blue green light, unlike the good old pull down shade that blocks everything 100%.

The cabin crew were pretty ordinary, they did just enough, never went beyond and stayed well planted in the galley, food ordinary, overall a disappointment.

But, on saying that, you have to accept this is what you pay for, so for me, I'll stick to the full service airlines like Cathay, SIA."
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"23 July,",,"It was the our first time travelling on Scoot on Friday, 17/7 as SIA was fully booked, from Perth to Singapore. Based on that experience, NEVER AGAIN. Flight was delayed from 6.30pm to 10pm. Given a pathetic reason 'Hold up in Singapore'. Had to sit at Perth airport for six hours. After I posted my comment on your Facebook page, there was no reply to the many passengers that had to endure a long wait. No matter how cheap your flights are, you should still apologize. One would think that as part of SIA, you should still have some form of service. 

When I landed in Singapore, all I heard from friends and family was 'That's Scoot, always delay'. I hope people read this so they don't experience the same long delays and bad service as my husband and I did. I understand Jetstar Asia is better."
Scoot,9-Oct,ar,"31 January,",,"We are oldies who once again have great difficulty in fighting our way through online flight booking sites, and Scoot where no exception with usual minesites concealed along the way and the invisible prompts which  stop you dead in your tracks. After finally booking our business class seats to Hongkong from Perth, my wife rang up to clarify if we had done the right things. Lo and behold we find we have booked economy seats, so in rode our big white knight Mathew who painstakingly  went through it with us rebooked our seats meals etc and did a great job removing our stress and despair. The only catch was because we had booked meals, by upgrading to Business class we cant get a credit for those meals, but no probs as they give you a free meal anyway so we are very impessed with the customer service phone line it was excellent. Well done Mathew. We couldnt find anywhere on Scoot ste to send a thanyou note but soemone in Scoot might see this. So we are looking forward to see if the flight carries on with the same standard Mathew has set. Darryl WA."
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"02 February,",,"PER-SIN-HKG SCOOT 777-200 9V-OTF  no both legs.

Aircraft well and truly showing age in the cabin. Tape holding parts of some seats together and I had a broken seat on both legs of the flight In general a very worn and tired cabin.

Paid for and selected specific seats in the 'Scoot in silence' section which appeared to be non-existant. 

The highlight was the attitude of and service provided by the cabin crew which couldn't be faulted.

With the pending entry into service of their new 787 aircraft it would seem to me that every expense has been spared by Scoot in maintaining a high standard of cabin in 9V-OTF."
Scoot,0 / 10,Vino Venitas,"04 May,",,Changed my flight from 4pm to 8am without proper notice. Their customer service was extremely rude and unwilling to offer any kind of help or possible solution. In all my years I have never experienced an airline this horrible. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this airline.
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"19 November,",,"Bought a return ticket with Scoot from Taipei to Sydney, via Singapore. Didn't purchase Scoot-Thru add-on because I knew I wouldn't need to change my flights, my plans were fixed. Arrived on time and ultimately waited through an eight hour delay, took off just before midnight for a flight scheduled to leave at 3.30pm. That's annoying but these things happen. What was unfair was that I missed my Singapore connecting flight, also a Scoot flight, due to the delay (I had purchased as one Taipei-Sydney package from the Scoot website). Scoot washed their hands of me at Singapore airport, said they weren't liable and it wasn't their responsibility to put me on another flight. Gave me two McDonald's vouchers and sent me on my way. I had to buy another ticket with another carrier to complete my journey to Sydney, more than $1200. Scoot's partner insurance service ultimately compensated me $150. The return flight back to Taipei was also delayed by three hours, and they lost my bags. I wasn't expecting five-star service, but I had hoped that purchasing a Taipei-Sydney ticket would mean they would deliver me from Taipei to Sydney."
Scoot,6-Oct,ar,"23 November,",,"Flew Melbourne to Singapore on SCOOTBIZ and return on FlyBagEat.  SCOOTBIZ seats was OK, more leg space and width. Food on the MEL/Spore leg was passable although serving was small compared to normal economy food.  The return leg although not SCOOTBIZ was passable except for the prepaid food.  We had scrambled eggs and croisants.  The scrambled eggs was melted like pudding or jelly and the hashbrown was mushy.  If normal airlines can served proper scrambled eggs, there is no reason why SCOOT can't served prepaid proper scrambled eggs.  Perhaps it is because of the poor preparation by SCOOT crew.  The croisant was likely better, although it is still icy inside.  The answer from a Scoot stuff when questioned about the scrambled eggs was---""other passengers have also complained"".  So much for their response to customers complaints.  

EDITORS COMMENT: Scoot are brilliant in every way except their food.. though I hear there have been some additions to the menu that are better. "
Scoot,6-Oct,ar,"09 December,",,Very poor communication. Need more reviews. Don't recommend. One flight. Just wanted to add my weight.  Thanks Afj
Scoot,6-Oct,ar,"09 October,",,"Flight was delayed five (5) hours Perth to Singapore. I was notified by TXT and email, no problem. Promise of $50 compensation voucher for delay over four (4) hours still in Scoot's bank because I don't have it.  Fly with them again? I don't know, Food bloody awful also. OK it's an economy airline but live up to your promises and don't play the passengers for idiots, Your livelihood - not mine!!

EDITORS COMMENT: It will come but it takes time. A refund generally takes 12 weeks. Food is terrible I agree but the airfare normally make up for this and you just eat before you leave. "
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"29 September,",,"Delay leaving Perth was ok, due to union disputes, but would have been nice to have a bit more of an update. Service on way to Singapore was good, minor hiccup with ScooTv codes that was sorted out. 

On way back completely different story. Flight delayed again due to undisclosed ""Technical issue"", no big deal. ScooTv access codes again an issue. Not sorted priot to take off (on ground, doors open) and finally told it was ground staff's fault 2 hours into the flight. Maybe if you worked that gem out before closing the doors when I asked the first time that would be awesome. 

Anyway, moving on. Partner was told twice that she couldn't use the toilets in ScootBiz, despite charging us close to $2k for the privilege of flying in ScootBiz. 

Terrible in-flight service. Not communication or training. Would have been better off flying Singapore Airlines Economy class for $600 less. "
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"26 February,",,"traveled from Perth to Singapore in  Business class,,  First leg on the 787.  A nice plane but why o why didn't they they install an entertainment system?  Flight on time and seating was reasonable, better than Economy any time.  Cabin crew were shown to be inexperienced and messed up food orders.  Wonder what they would act like in an emergency? Return flight delayed one and a half hours due to an instrument fault on the 777.  also gate changed without notice at check in, lucky it was gate E28 and not E 27.  Again cabin crew acted raw.  Limited drink menu and the food was poor quality.   Rated cabin crew as fair becuse they were willing but not trained or experenced.
EDITORS COMMENT: The in flight entertainment on the 787 is coming in the next few months "
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"03 August,",,"My daughter Grandaughter and myself travelled by Scoot from Hong Kong to Singapore, then Singapore to Perth.  As my daughter was wearing a moon boot for an ankle injury, when booking seats, the person booking us listed us for row 30 as he said this would offer my daughter extra leg space.  Sadly when we boarded and settled, suddenly staff started stressing about her sitting in that row with a protective boot...said it was a safetly issue, although could not define what safetly issue.  In desperation we paid to be moved into business class from Hong Kong to Singapore.  When we boarded that flight, same seats had been alloted, but again staff stressed about safety issues with my daughter sitting there.  Asked to pay to move to business class, no that was not an option...insisted she move before take off as if there were issues in take off she would not be able to run???  As they made the whole incident so embarrassing for her, she finally conceded to move as directed.  After take off my grandaughter and I insisted to be moved to be with her, which did occur.  However the staff member who insisted on the move,  Gra Shi Ting was rude  and offensive, telling my daughter she was disabled"
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"15 April,",,"First of all, I read that reviews about compensation and so on will not be published, but I consider this occasion as one that should be known if people consider to fly with Scoot.

I know you get what you pay for. In this case I didn't even get that. The ground staff denied me entry to the flight, based on the reason that I am ""too late"" (I was not. As were the 10 other people waiting in queue with me for over 20 minutes.).
The ""24h English Help Hotline"" is ""not there for such discussions"" (yes, this is a quote).
The support of Scoot didn't answer to my complaints on their hotline, their homepage, nor their Facebook page (which shows the complaint as read).

If you have the choice, chose another airline."
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"13 May,",,I fly at least 50 x per year. This is by far the worst airline i have ever used. They never respond to emails nor phone calls.
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"12 June,",,"Bought flexibility option from singapore to sydney round trip. For the return leg, we wanted to fly on a later date. We followed their ""quirky"" instructions published in their website, which advised us to make changes online and take pictures of the changes (which was really weird). We proceeded to do so about 3 weeks before the original return date. Nearing our departure date, we found out that our return leg was reflected as ""no-show"". We immediately called to enquire, the call center could not help but asked us to send an email via their website. Be warned that they do not have reminder service for departures. Therefore, we did not know the change did not take effect. A reply email to inform that they would investigate, this was since late Feb 2015. They did not honor it and their customer service is really bad and rude. Its fruitless to follow their instructions to wait for their investigation result as to date, there was no response. Called the call center several times, their responses are scripted and are absolutely unhelpful if not untrue. Terrible. This was my first time travelling with Scoot and will be the last time. Avoid them as they will cause much grief."
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"02 May,",,"Seats are tight, no entertainment except you pay to watch over your device using in airline wifi, airline charge for every little thing including phone charging and water, can't put arms on armrests as light push button on it and elbows press them when we rest our arms, leg room not enough for tall person, no blankets provided. Overall budget flight which cost almost same as others when we add basic needs like travel luggage."
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"27 January,",,"First time Scoot flyer. Paid $30 extra in Bangkok for my luggage to travel direct to Gold Coast via Singapore. As told I went to  the transit lounge for my boarding pass for Singapore to the Gold Coast but was told I had not paid for that facility and would have to be processed through Singapore immigration and check in again. Never done this with any other airline flying transit before. Upon checking back in I was told my luggage was  not flying direct as paid for but it was off loaded and I should have collected it prior to being processed at immigration. Now I had to get customs clearance to go back to collect my luggage that by now was no longer on the carousel and had to go to lost luggage to find it. After spending nearly an hour waiting at lost luggage I was informed they had found it and as the normal proceedure was to collect it and pass through immigration again then check it back in and pass through security I was running out of time to make my connecting flight (I spent spent 2.5 hours of my 3 hour layover finding my lost luggage) out of time they said they would load it directly on the plane as paid for. I arrived on the Gold Coast and still no luggage, Still lost."
Scoot,2-Oct,,"17 October,",,"Terrible experience. Flew Singapore to Sydney, pre-booked wifi and selected seat and paid for. When I arrived the plane had been changed and I didnt have the selected seat or wifi. No email or update on the change and when I asked staff to be relocated and have wifi they said I would have to repay and contact the airline. I contacted the airline 2 weeks ago via submission form and no response. I called the airline and all 3 calls dropped out at exactly the same point in the pre-recorded message. Awful, awful customer service. On board staff were abrupt and drinks - even water was ridiculously expensive, $4 for a tiny half bottle for water. No water could be carried on board as we had to discard bottles before entering the departure area. No free water provided at all, which is a basic human right. I paid for wifi on board (for the second time) as I had work to do and the wifi didnt work at all for the entire flight. Still waiting for a refund on that too."
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"06 March,",,"You get what you pay for. It is probably one of the better low cost carriers and is miles ahead of Tiger. The child free zone is excellent. The meals are inflexible, ie it's coke not diet coke or lemonade, it's coke. So much for being diabetic or not liking cola. A bit more flexibility would go a long way. Let the pax decide before he/she boards! The staff are friendly but do not know what the call button means; might as well remove it. The faux excitement is a bit much to stomach and even the crew don't seem to like it, especially when English is not their first language. And finally, while the women are well dressed the male flight attendants look as though they have escaped from a sports shoe store."
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"08 November,",,"Since the booking process they try to scam you. You select no seat and no insurance, they still make you pay for the seats. You go back to check this out, and then, the insurance is automatically selected. It's a real struggle to manage to get your booking without any supplement. Having issues since the booking process doesn't look good for the company already.
Flights are OK, although food and entertainment are very bad. Seats are quite unconfortable, but OK for the price. "
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"24 December,",,"I travelled on Scoot from Sg to Perth with my four daughters.  On the way to Perth, the flight was delayed from 1310hrs to 1650hrs.  What was meant to be dinner with family turned into having them come pick us up from the airport at 2200hrs. Similarly on our return flight, another delay meant reaching Singapore not at 0010hrs but 0330hrs. While I fully understand that Scoot is a budget airline and delays can be expected, never did I dream it will be by this much and frequency.  No apology was made at Perth side, not at check nor onboard.  To say I was disappointed would be understatement.  The reason I chose to fly Scoot was the time offered to me and thinking it's a subsidiary of SIA, it should share some traits.  I have flown Scoot & Tiger before and was happy with it but this recent experience have left me jaded."
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"21 July,",,"My flight was from Singapore to Melbourne, which is more than a 6 hour flight. For a flight of this duration I found it unacceptable that there were no inflight entertainment screens. On such a new plane at that! Even if you were willing to purchase entertainment, like I was, you would be out of luck! There were no USB ports to charge your own device should you wish to watch one of your own movies either! Water had to be purchased and was not made freely available like on other budget airlines I've flown, such as Jetstar and AirAsia. Cabin staff were just going through the motions! I was eagerly waiting for them to get to my row to buy some water, but when they finally got there, before I had a chance to ask for anything they had moved on right past me! Also, I'm pretty sure I heard them announce that eating your own food is not permitted on their flight. I'm not sure what you are meant to eat if you have not pre-ordered food, as there were no menus available and for all I could tell, there was no option to purchase any food on board. Although, this impression could be partly attributed to the poor service from the cabin staff. I would never fly scoot again!"
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"30 November,",,"Very bad, flight delayed by more than 21 hours. No proper communication.

Booked flight on 29-Nov-2016 from Singapore to Chennai. 

Flight rescheduled from 10:30 PM to 3:40 AM to 6:00 AM to 9 AM to 6 PM to 8:15 PM. "
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"07 October,",,"Flew PER- SIN 17/9 and return 24/9 .This was a very full night flight with lots of groups of men on a boys trip to the Formula 1. Hence, there was a lot of alcohol being consumed on this flight. Thumbs up to the Scootees telling the guys in front of us they had enough to drink! Was surprised there is quite good legroom in economy compared to other budget airlines. Better to pre order a meal if you like to eat, as pre -ordered meals come out first then it seems to take a long time for anyone else to get their meal. Don't order the ham & cheese croissant, it almost comes frozen, not a nice texture ! My son said the teriyaki chicken wrap was tasty and my husband liked his nasi lemak. The salad on the return flight home was a good serving size. Hint, there is a water fountain in the boarding lounge at Changi airport, take an empty water bottle with you and refill before your flight.  We had no in-flight entertainment, you did have the option of paying USD11.95 / hour for wifi...no thanks.  Overall they were quite good flights both ways, would probably fly them again but not too keen on the time you arrive in SIN, after 12AM by time you get through customs.  Got to hotel about 1.30AM."
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"24 October,",,Our first flight with Scoot and probably the last .. we submitted an upgrade for Scoot Biz which we received but the total lack of service and sub standard didnt make it enjoyable.  The food and beverage was worse than other airlines economy options and everything was about selling products to make more money ..  the welcome drink a plastic cup of water .. lunch in plastic container.. no tea or coffee offered... no wine available as out of stock.. you have to purchase wifi if you want to utilise... the crew did not speak to us just sat behind the curtain gossiping ... very poor experience Scoot...
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"24 September,",,"Purchased window seating in Silence Section - paid extra for these seats.  Perth to Singapore no problems....Singapore to Perth - chaotic.  Upon arrival at Changi airport we were told the planes were changing but we had the same seats even though we originally had 8a and 8b but now we were 33a and 33b.  Upon boarding the plane we were taken into normal economy.  Yet at checkin we were assured we were in the same area and seats!  Staff tried to state this is what I had booked - thank goodness I had my printout and confirmation with me.  Eventually we were given a seat in the area, no window seat.  No apology.  No offer of the extra money we had paid - NOTHING!  Food is awful.  Service was non-existent.  "
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"10 December,",,"Should be called Scat Airlines. 5 and a half hours late leaving Melbourne for Singapore, 2 and a half hours late returning."
Scoot,10-Oct,ar,"21 August,",,We flew Gold Coast Australia to Singapore 2 days ago & had one of the best experiences in a long time. We paid a little extra to sit in the Quiet Zone which is rows 6-10 just behind Business Class. Comfortable seats with adequate leg-room. Attentive & pleasant flight attendants. Nice food & drinks & we were even able to pay in $AUD
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"23 May,",,Very poor customer service they do not take responsibility for any thing that goes wrong. If they fail to provide meals that have been pre ordered & paid for all you get is sorry. I f you do not get to sit in the seat you have chosen & paid for that's not their problem . Paid for inflight Wi-Fi that does not work you don't even get a sorry.  They are cheap but the service is cheaper..
Scoot,6-Oct,ar,"08 May,",,"Recommend taking Singaporean dollars with you and plenty of it if you plan on eating or drinking anything. They don't even offer a glass of water free. Zippo. The staff were friendly enough. 

EDITORS COMMENT: No it's a low cost carrier so they can charge for everything, that's why the actual airfare is a lot cheaper than a full service carrier. "
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"04 July,",,"Late take off at both Singapore and Sydney.
Business class would expect eyemask without paying.
No entertainment of flight fromSydney as aircraft not fitted with wifi yet.
One senior experienced cabin staf, the rest not up to her standard.
7 hour flight but i must choose my meal before we take off.
Will take SQ economy next time."
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"27 January,",,My confirmed booking from Bangkok to Singapore vanished into thin air. No assistance given to rectify the problem. Had to purchase another ticket at the counter for $300AUD and Scoot advises they will only refund $69AUD. Absolute theft and fraud. I will be doing everything in my power to see this airline buried where it belongs. 
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"11 February,",,"Scoot Airline is a sucker and not a budget airline. I am pregnant and I do not wish to fly and thus I ask them to change my name to my parent. I paid $800+ for the airfare. They are inconsiderate, they wanted me to provide medical certificate which is almost impossible to provide. I have checked with doctor and they couldnt give me the certificate as I aint having a diarrhoea or infectious disease. I would thought Scoot could grant me the changes with my reasons, but NO! For the last 8 hours, I receive the email from them with a link, outlining their rules etc. That has gone too far Scoot! You are a sucker, inconsiderate and bad sales service.

You have lose me and I will spread the bad things about you. "
Scoot,6-Oct,ar,"07 February,",,6/2/14 Sing Perth. Economy fare good value at very short notice (on web ) Food is still pretty dreadful so scoff up before boarding :) As android does not work with Scoot  bring a book or Snooze .Cabin Crew appear to be getting better every flight .Plane was clean  probably 70%full  yellow seats comfy so snoozed on way back.The deal maker with this sector is the arrival time into Perth  18.20 spot on time every time been with them .777 is also a big plus as block times faster than the airbus  alternatives and just feel better all round.Irrational perhaps but where 777 are on sectors try and get those is my prefered pick .Scoot web is still a dogs breakfast but good bang for buck .Inexperienced travellers really must study every weasel clause to avoid any disappointment .Reckon Parent is on a winner here with this sector at least  
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"30 July,",,"One of the worst airlines I have ever travelled with. On the 17th of July I had taken a flight from Singapore to Chennai. Flight No. F502 from Terminal 1. It was a 22.45 departure & we were already tired. We cleared the security check & boarded the flight. Before take off the captain announces a technical difficulty & we were offloaded & made to wait for 3 hrs. We had to go through the security check again & in the hand baggage they found us carrying a perfume bottle which they said they wouldn't let us carry as it was above 100 ml. However, they missed this one during their security check the first time. When requested, the security staff there, Selva Kumar, was really rude and got into an argument with us. When highlighted that the first time we were let go with the perfume in the hand baggage and the airline was at fault, he refused to take responsibility on behalf of the airline and bluntly said that he didn't care. Highly unprofessional, neither courteous nor empathetic. I am an Ex employee of Indigo airlines & he was teaching me airline rules.  He had the audacity to tell us that he would not let us take the flight. He refused to apologize & such staff need to be fired. "
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"08 November,",,"If you fly with scoot and you transit anywhere, you have to clear customs pick up your baggage and check in at every transit destination! Unless you pay $57 + $7.50 card charge for scoot though. Service is terrible as reviewed by others and you can't use the toilets.

EDITORS COMMENT: Yep that's another optional add on that low cost carriers offer. If you don't want the extra charges you do the bags yourself. Full service airlines with their higher fares include all this which is why they cost more and are referred to as 'all inclusive' airlines. not sure what you mean about not being bale to use the toilet? There's nine toilets on economy so shouldn't have been any problem."
Scoot,4-Oct,,"04 January,",,"I wish to register a complaint about your working symtem which, even right now, I am not sure if this mistake ocurred because of the Thai operation or the Japanese operation which caused a lot of inconvenience and the delay to get on board at gate at Narita Airport. Before boarding, there was an anouncement asking me to meet your staff at the gate. At the beginning she spoke to me politely and asked me to show my credit card that I used to purchase the ticket on Dec. 19 in Thailand which is a one-way ticket flying from Narita Airport to Donmeung Airport, Bangkok. She insisted it must be the card which the last four ending numbers are 0322 which is not the numbers on any of cards. She showed me the document which showed the recored mode of my payment XW Visa XXXXXXXXXXXX0119 0322 This confused me. She's not trying to understand or think logically that the last four numbers are 0119 and the numbers 0322 must be the numbers of something else which, at that time, I myself could no relate it with the expiration date of my card. She still kept insisting that it must be only the card with the four final numbers 0322 or else I had to buy a new ticket, and her tone was impolite as well her face most of the time that I tried the clear the situation and wondered whose fault it was that delayed my boarding. At that moment, I had a very bad cold and felt so dizzzy that I could not deal with the situation perfectly and did not think of asking to see the manager about the mistake and almost caused me to buy a new ticket and wasted the money that I purchased the ticket in Thailand. Anyway, she finally called someone to check about my purchase and luckily I showed her the documents I was holding with me which showed the last final four number 0119 and the ticket was confirmed. I would appreciate it if you would look into the matter and make sure that this will not recur to any other customers, especially if a customer cannot communicate in English. This caused me a very bad impression which I will convey to my colleagues at the universiy in Bangkok as well my students in my English courses. Today, you have to compete with the other two airlines: Air AsiaX and Thai Lion Air. I didn't look at the name on her shirt, so I can't give you the name of that staff dealing with me on that day. My flight was XW 101 dated Jan. 2, 2019 departing Narita at 13.55 and I'm an English instructor at a university in Bkk. Thank God she finally figured out that 0322 is the expiration number."
Scoot,7-Oct,Basil Ben,"26 July,",,"I travelled on the new A320 from SIN to TRV and returned recently. It was a really no frills airline down to the bone airline.

 My old school bus seat had better cushioning for a 4 hours flight. I could feel the seat metal frame on my back and bum.

 The airline should understand sometimes value for money should not be at the expense of basic comfort. My bones were aching the next day after the flight."
Scoot,10-Oct,ar,"23 November,",,"Just like to feedback that this was our first time on Scoot from Singapore to Melbourne, dep. -13 Nov & return 21 Nov. WE generally found flight stewardess services very good. As I was not familiar with the on-line booking, we only used less than half of the total weight (i.e. only about 48kgs) to and fro.
Prior to our dep. Melbourne, a pre-check on our weighing scale indicate over-weight as the weighing scale used was accidentally set on the unit of pounds instead of kilograms. As such, I had to call to increase my check-in luggage by another 20kgs on 20 Nov and paid S$58/- extra. 
Appreciate if you could kindly perform a check on your system and WE would be very glad to receive any re-fund as explained above. Have a great & blessed day & weeks ahead.

B/Regards

Scoot,6-Oct,ar,"03 January,",,"We took a returned flight Scoot from Singapore to Perth on 3rd Jan and it was a full flight. The services provided by the service staff were really poor. When get onboard the staff greeted us with no smile (probably they felt sorry going back to work after the public holiday). We travelled with Scoot every year and could tell the services provided by the staff were going downhill. Whe Scoot first started to fly out of Perth, services were excellent, gradually the standard drops every year. 
Apparently, we were not allow web check in in Singapore when our booking was from Perth. This was told by one of the rude staff from the call centre. It's very disappointing to see such a good reputable airline like your with rude staff."
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"21 March,",,"My opinipn is that Scoot is probably ok but in would suggest having a connecting flight. Purely because of a tendency gor delays. Of u do have a connecting flight, suggest book a day after scheduled arrival."
Scoot,5-Oct,mister user,"17 October,",,"How does Scoot customer service works:

- Redirect you to 3rd party - you will be in loop.
- They will harass by asking more &amp; more info or put you on hold for long time or/and disconnect your call
- They will tell your problem is escalated and someone will call in 24hrs but no one will call.
- When you call back after 24 hours they will tell nothing is escalated. 
- If you tell them you want to speak to the same customer service staff that you previously discussed or you want to talk to supervisor, they will tell they are busy.
- When you call back after 24 hours then you have to explain the whole problem from starting and one of the above will happen.
- You can lodge inquiry in there website and if you give follow up call then one of the above will happen.
- And they will lie easily and make false promise or play delay tactics."
Scoot,0 / 10,Bob Smith,"04 October,",,"Worst airline in my 25 years flying. 
They do not have staff at the airport (either Singapore or anywhere else!).
They take your money - but then do not refund it when they cancel their flights.
I am so sorry I chose them. If someone avoids this horrible company because of my review - I will be happy. Learn from my mistake."
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"20 July,",,"First time flew with Scoot in December 2015 with my daughter from Melbourne to Singapore. Comfortable and spacious.
Second time around flew from Melbourne to Singapore on the 2nd July and vice versa on the 11th July, can't fault this airline at all. Had my cousin with me for the return flight. She wasn't sure about this airline but she was amazed too and said the plane was all white and looks spacious enough and the seat was comfortable too.
Overall, well done Scoot. I'll be flying again on the 13th October for my cousin's wedding and can't wait for it."
Scoot,4-Oct,Joseph Miller,"11 November,",,"This airline doesn't let you bring your own food or drinks onboard. Once I got on, I tried to buy some water, as they don't give it out for free. I was on my way from Singapore to Melbourne (Australia), so I tried to pay using Australian coins. The flight attendant wouldn't accept coins. I had a US$100 note, so tried that. She said $100 was too big a note. I tried my Visa cards, but they wouldn't accept debit cards.

""So there's no way I can get water on this flight?""

Flight attendant smiled and said, ""Sorry.""

The flight was 7.5 hours long. Don't fly with this company."
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"26 July,",,"I flew on scoot from gold coast to Singapore. I am disappointed that the seats are soooo uncomfortable. I in fact travelled on the extra legroom seats, still ended up with a back pain as the seat has very little padding and the handles are extremely cheap plastic. To make it worse some idiot deviced the buttons for lights and attendants on the handles. So people were constantly pressing them accidentally, so there is a light show and the attendant button being randomly pressed. I think even the flight attendants are irritated with this as they have to constantly come and tell people please cancel it as you accidentally pressed it. 
The most ridiculous thing is they don't even offer water free of charge! This is a 8.5 hour flight. Where are the human rights? Will they charge for air next?  I think this should not be legally allowed. Even a cheap domestic flight where you pay under $50 sometimes gives water free of charge. A small 200 ml water is $4.00. What if someone is not carrying money and does not have a credit card? I think it is inhumane not to give water on a 8.5 hour flight. Will never travel again. It is definitely not value for money. 
EDITORS COMMENT: Whilst we don't agree with no free water, the fact is that they are a low cost carrier and therefore they can charge for these things- majority of low cost carriers do. There is a reason that you booked this flight over Singapore Airlines or Qantas, the cost. Full service airlines include everything but on a low cost carrier you do compromise in flight product for a cheaper fare. Scoot are actually one of the most comfortable low cost carriers as they use twin aisle aircraft rather than single."

Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"08 January,",,"Paid 600 for SCOOT from Sydney to Sing with meal included but then when on board they didnt give me meal stating it was not in the bill. They can see clearly from the bill that i have paid extra 17 dollar for meal but decline to give me any food due to their inflexible and poor service, which leads to my decrease in health as i have very bad health already and the flight was 8 hours. 
They told me to claim the money back when on board however when ask service desk she seems to not care and say nothing can be done, told me to call centre. It took more than two hours to reach them due to my experience hence i gave them the money and told them they just lost their customers, the service lady doesn't care either. 
Additionally i purchased extra kg for luggage and then my partner who traveled with me  exceed his luggage and the staff didnt tell us we could transfer kg which leads to extra charges (400$ to be exact). However after a long complain we finally have a right charge (50$) but took lots of effort and time.
To conclude, scoot was the worst flight service i've ever flew with due to their tricky of making money from people and i advise people NOT to book with SCOOT. "
Scoot,10-Oct,ar,"06 May,",,"Travelled from Singapore to Melbourne on 2nd May 2016 and I can't fault Scoop.  We checked in 6 hours before departure and all of the staff were so helpful.  They took our luggage and provided me with a wheelchair, (which I hadn't requested), but the check-in assistant knew that I had a problem, and she went so out of her way to get a wheelchair for me.  I just cannot recommend Scoot enough for future travellers.  You certainly get more than you pay for.  Very well done Scoot.  I was very very impressed."
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"29 May,",,"We flew with Scoot for the first time and were pleasantly surprised.
After reading some of the reviews, we were abit apprehensive however all was good.

We were on time and the staff were efficient and friendly and the journey was very comfortable.
We will definitely fly Scoot again. "

Bid to upgrade to Scoot business and bid accepted by email and Visa charged bid amount. Yippy!!

Arrived at airport to find flight delayed by approx 3 hours (4.14am) yuk.

When finally check in advised that the type of plane has changed and has fewer Business Class seats so we are bumped back to economy- yukkkk!  Not happy and money already taken.

The flight staff & Captain do their best to make all who are bumped to economy feel good , which was the only positive. We get a free meal/ wine and TV so at least they tried for something which was not their fault do well done to the crew.

Never the less, contacted Scoot on arrival home to see when we would be repaid our Business Class 'bid' fare and told it would take 3 weeks - well 3 weeks has passed and no payment so just crossing my fingers& legs and hope it comes soon.

I love the Dreamliner plane and will fly Scoot again,

EDITORS COMMENT: Thanks for your balanced and informative review. Too often people focus on whats gone wrong rather than how the airline tried to help when something unplanned did happen. You will get the refund - many airlines take 12 weeks so if you get it in three to four then that's actually very good. "

Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"18 April,",,"Sydney to Singapore return. The staff were friendly, the food was good, on time both ways. The seats are uncomfortable and I would recommend taking a cushion and a pillow if you want to sleep.   The value is good."
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"13 June,",,"I travelled from Sydney to Singapore on Scoot in May 2013.  Flight left and arrived on time.  We had paid an extra $25 to choose a 2 seater at the back of the plane.  The first row after the 3 seaters stopped and we were disappointed to find it had a fixed arm rest.  The rest of the two seaters behind did not.  I would avoid this seat if travelling with a companion. 

I have flown with Air Asia several times and certainly find their seats more comfortable.  The scoot seat was really hard.  

Cabin crew were good but food was quite poor.  Still the flight in under 8 hours so it is not a big deal. 

I would not fly with them for an overnight flight but the day flight was good for the price. "
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"25 January,",,I had booked two Scoot business seats Hong Kong to Singapore in May 2016 and a further two business seats Singapore to Perth. Scoot had neglected their duties to inform us that they no longer fly out of Hong Kong and placed us on a Tiger Air flight leaving Hong Kong on the 13 Jan 2017. We were not informed of this change until late Dec 2016. I tried to seek clarification and compensation for the price variation between economy Tiger Air and Scoot business. Clearly there is a huge difference in what we paid for and what we received. The call center could not assist us due to their computers crashing at the time. At Singapore Airport Scoot could not assist with our situation eithger. I rang today 25/01/2017 to seek compensation for the price we paid for Scoot Business and the Tiger Air flight we both experienced. I was told by the Scoot call center they could not assist. Too bad! Scoot does not have a complaint section other than the ineffective call center to resolve a simple issue of compensation. Singapore Airlines as the parent company should take some ownership of complaints regarding Scoot. No one seems to care. I would not recommend Scoot to anyone. 
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"16 June,",,"Scoot business was very poor. TV service was broken both routes,so noentertainment for 2 seven hour journeys. Staff English was poor, food was poor to average. Overall a bad experience. Qantas economy is better than Scoot biz. Recommend you avoid this airline if you want comfort and service."
Scoot,7-Oct,ar,"11 November,",,"Very cheap price for a flight from Singapore to Melbourne. I actually missed my flight and showed up  a day later (my mistake) and the Scoot ground crew was very helpful and put me on another flight with a small charge.

Scoot,10-Oct,ar,"29 January,",,"We found Scoot to our liking for the Perth to Singapore and return trip mid-January, the only downside to not having Airline Controlled Entertainment was that the man in the aisle seat of row 10 was watching a pornographic video on his IPad, as such anyone walking past from the rear of the aircraft got an eyeful, unfortunately you can't select the type of person you have to fly with!"

I'm in my 70's and had carry on so the quick hike back up was exhausting and by the time I arrived there I was nearly last in the queue to security check again. I need to please ask that some consideration be given to offering free water at least on these longer flights, I was quite severely dehydrated and the small bottle of water at $4 was outrageous. I appreciate the fare is budget so didn't expect much but these issues really spoiled my experience with Scoot. Love SQ which I've used many times over  the years I was in business. A little sad some of their experience hasn't shown on the airline."

When I questioned that we had paid extra for extra seating staff just advised that the seats had been double booked.  When I wrote to Scoot was only offered $50 Singapore dollars per passenger (I paid equivalent to $82 Singapore Dollars for seat allocation)  This was not offered as a refund but a ""voucher"" to use when travelling on Scoot again.  No money was given for back for the meals not provided (ended up buying them again on board as my son was starving)....  Whilst I understand problems happen, Scoot has offered no 'refund"" just a voucher towards any future bookings.    I won't be travelling on Scoot.

In fact the only issue on both the Scoot flights was the high level of demanding whining customers. Get a grip people this is a no frills budget airline where you only pay for what you order and don't hassle the Scootees because your expectations don't match the little amount of money that you paid. Saved over $900 on round trip for 3 adults on Scoot, agreeable schedule Melbourne Singapore route. So Scoot you now have my business from your parent airline.

No call center involved. No delays. As an LCC, it's usual that F&B should be paid, and I don't find that some criticisms towards this airlines sound. At least not the worst airline I've encountered. The meal (nasi lemak, otak-otak and a can of green tea) is okay. The only unsatisfied part is that I have to ask a crew member to get my immigration card in my flight to S'pore .

On return trip we bid for upgrade to business class and got this  Again this was very good as flight was during night  Compared to Aust discount airlines Scoot was very good but it may have been because of the 787 planes used  I certainly got the impression Scoot would charge for everything possible   They carefully weighed all cabin baggage to see it complied and I gather this will be standard practice on all Scoot flights 
 I certainly would be happy to use Scoot in the future [provided price is acceptable] mainly because of their use of 787 planes  Compared to the old hand me down planes  used by other Aust discount airlines it was a joy to travel in such high class planes and to me this places Scoot in a premium class compared to other discount airlines and the older equipment used by them"
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"19 August,",,"I have not seen such a poor customer service before. I was flying to Singapore from Gold Coast. My friend and I had some food with us. My friend is vegan, and there was nothing for her in their menu. Also, the food they offer generally seemed pretty boring and expensive for us. A stewardess came to us immediately after boarding, and said that we are not allowed to consume our own food on board, we need to buy food from them! She was very unfriendly, did not smile at all, and literally started a discussion with us. We explained that my friend is vegan and that there is nothing suitable on the menu. After a 10-minute discussion she said she will make an exception for us and allow us to eat our food. She also said that apparently it is her job to make us follow such rules. Well, even if that is really true, I don't want to know who creates those rules. I have not seen such cheekiness in my entire life. I am also wondering if her boss has also told her to be so unfriendly with customers. I was shocked by their service and it definitely spoiled my mood. Never again."
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"31 January,",,"We flew from Hong Kong to Perth with connection in Singapore. We chose this flight due to the booking stating that we would not have to recheck in baggage in the connection like some of the other flights available, so when we arrived at Check-In and were asked to pay an additional fee to ensure this we were not very happy. I went through my booking confirmations with eDreams and Scoot but could find no mention of Scoot-Thru. When we attempt to explain this or speak to a supervisor, we were either flat-out ignored or told it was too early for anyone else to be here that could help. We paid the additional charge. After we took off, I asked for a glass of water but apparently with Scoot they do not offer any free drinking water, only sell bottles of water and I would have to wait until the trolley comes past. I understand that on a budget airline drinks and snacks would need to be purchased, but not to offer water on a 5hour flight is ridiculous, and to deny someone water because the trolley had not made it to their row was quite shocking as I was rejected again when I asked for water from the galley (willing to pay). Finally, the seats were cramped with zero neck support or comfort.

EDITORS COMMENT: Most low cost carriers don't provide free water - not something we agree with but they are well within their rights not to. No low cost airline (Jetstar, Scoot, Airasia) on that five hour route offers free water. 
Scoot thoo needs to be made more clear. "

 At BER, 5+1 check-in counters were open, it went pretty quickly.
 Boarding began at 09:10 and at 09:55 the aircraft was moving towards the runway.  Start was at 10:16 am.

 The seats in the EC are sufficiently spaced, the internationally customary distance, the backrests of the seats can be tilted backwards and the headrests can be pushed up and down and adjusted on the sides.
 There is no multimedia offering on the seats.

 Immediately after takeoff, the plane is cooled down extremely, you can't switch anything off.

 A can of Coke, 320ml, costs 4 Singapore dollars.  Credit card and cash are accepted, change is given in SGD.  Sometimes, even at night, a cart comes through and drinks and food are sold.  Then the festive lighting goes on everywhere for about 30 minutes.

 The flight to SIN was on time and perfect except for the temperature.
 The SIN-BKK plane has very tight seating, at least 5-10 cm less legroom than on long-haul routes, no headrests, backrests cannot be adjusted, no multimedia offerings.  But not as cold as the first plane."

When I inquired about procedure for missing a flight we were directed to another desk. Upon arriving, they said that because they just represented Scoot there was nothing they could do to help. Then we were directed to the Nok Scoot bookings office.

Then after some discussion he checked the itinerary and found a flight to Singapore the next day for 780 USD for 2.5 people. I asked to see the details and immediately realised it would mean we missed our connecting flight to Gold Coast. When I pointed this out the guy just smiled and laughed and told me I would need to buy another ticket. Ended up booking AirAsia. Travelling with an 18 month old is difficult enough without having smug unhelpful staff rubbing your nose in it! :-("
Scoot,10-Oct,ar,"02 December,",,Flew from Taiwan to Tokyo. Great airline but very early start. Was impressed with leg room and service for a budget airline.
Scoot,2-Oct,ar,"06 August,",,The first time with Scoot and will be the last time. Worst service ever. 
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"19 January,",,"Flew home from Hong Kong via Singapore - arrived 2 in the morning and sought out the Scoot desk to purchase a 'scoot on' so that my checked bag would not have to be collected by me but would be forwarded on to Melbourne per my next flight.  They advertise $20 for this service but charged me $40.  Arrived in Melbourne and no bag.  I was flying out the following day - still no bag.  The contact number they gave me is often 'unattended' so calling to catch up and get an update is difficult. No offer of compensation and uncomfortable stay in Melbourne with no toiletries or clean clothes.  Three days later they say they have found my bag - spoke to a contact person and asked that they forward to Devonport airport and have it couriered to my home per the address on the tag.  They leave a message on my phone saying they are sending the bag to Hobart - 10 hour round trip drive from my home and the furthest airport they could select in Tasmania - and that they would not be couriering it to me and that it was my problem to collect it.  Left two messages regarding this to try and stop them sending it to Hobart - no response.Staff rude and unhelpful. Food crap. No entertainment.  

EDITORS COMMENT: The fly through bag option is cheaper is you pre-purchase it online at the time of booking. There is in flight entertainment but you need to bring your own personal device and pay a fee in most cases which is to be expected on a low cost carrier. 
The bag really should have been couriered to your house and we are not sure why it was not. "
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"01 August,",,"Before  my return trip last week I would have rated Scoot as 10, great value for money. However after a serious accident in Malaysia & needing to return to Australia urgently I went to Scoot Changi at midday explained the situation & asked if I  could get on a flight back that night Tuesday rather than the one I had booked on Thursday (I knew I would not recover any money back). Their answer yes for $750. The most I have seen for the Gold Coast - Singapore leg has been around $380-400 either way, in fact my total return trip with larger seats, meals, 20kg luggage, lounge in Changi was $520. I said that this seemed unreasonable, & especially so as I know that they resold the seat I had booked. They said the high cost was due to a nearly full flight & due to my urgency to get back to hospital I was forced to pay what they asked. On the flight there were still quite a few empty seats available!"
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"24 January,",,"I booked online, and wanted to travel with Scoot Perth - Hong Kong, it wasn't until I got to Singapore I realised I was travelling Tigerair for the Singapore - Hong Kong let.  First ""Jellyfish"", if I wanted to travel Tigerair, I would have booked Tigerair.
I booked and paid for Meals, and when I boarded my flight Scoot advised, that I had not.  When I got to Hong KOng and looked at my booking, I had paid for meals.
I also paid for seat allocation $19 AUD per sector, but was charged $48.00 per sector.  This I should have picked up when paying, but to be honest, I dropped out of their website, and was so frustrated with the software package that Scoot uses, I was about to give up and not book at all.  I went to Scoot Desk in Singapore to advise that no meal was provided, they said we didn't pay.  I also advised that the seat allocation had been dropped off their system, after I paid extra (as I was travelling with my son, I wanted to sit next to him).  I have now been on the phone holding for 40mins and speaking for over 30 mins to try to sort this mess out.  Scoot is understaffed.  And this definitely wasn't a cheap ticket.  2566 AUD return for 2 persons Perth-HKG-Per"
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"11 July,",,"I was promised that I would be rreimbursed the full taxi fare for having to get a taxi home from the airport at midnight after a flight was cancelled. It has been a month since then and despite numerous calls to Scoot, being on hold for up to an hour, an email and online claim, unable had no resolution and no reimbursement. The taxi cost $157.24 and after Scoot originally promising they would reimburse the whole fare, they then tried to tell me I would only get $50 per person on the ticket. Now I'm being told we will only be reimbursed $50 total despite the two guest living in different suburbs. "
Scoot,6-Oct,ar,"09 April,",,"Travelled Scootbiz Syd-Sin 27/2, Sin-Syd 15/2, don't expect 5 star more like premium economy. The plane was a Boeing 787 that was relatively quiet, the seats well although the base and back were comfortable the 'leg rest' was not well designed. It did not extend out far which in my case allowed my legs to hang perched on the hard edge which was uncomfortable and unusable  in a short time. A fold out ledge would have improved the seat considerably. The meal was adequate much like food hall Asian. the website was very flaky as I was unable to select my meal as was proposed. An OK flight. The flight attendants were always on the move."
Scoot,9-Oct,ar,"12 June,",,"My husband & I flew Scoot (aircraft type B772) from Sydney-Singapore on a recent trip to Colombo.  

Our whole experience with Scoot was very positive: it was a very good value for money flight which was on-time, the seats were comfortable & the in-flight service was excellent.  There was even some unusual & fun entertainment in the form of interactive games on board thrown together by the friendly cabin crew.  

We were especially impressed by the flight's chief steward, Geoffrey Goh (I think was his name) we especially appreciated his help in getting us organised to disembark first in order to catch our connecting flight.   "
Scoot,3-Oct,,"03 February,",,"Avoid Scoot, don't fly Singapore if the connector airline is Scoot! As a frequent flyer to Asia, I have flown Singapore Airlines ever since 1994, and have been delighted. But, since they pass Scoot Airlines is owned by them, I say, avoid Singapore Airlines at all cost. Scoot Airlines agents (not wearing any name tags)and its call center are shockingly unprofessional, heartless, untrustworthy, sceaming, lacking of common sense or courtesy, and a disgrace to the once proud Singapore brand. My wife was at Clark Airport near Angeles City in the Philippines, trying to take a short flight to Singapore so that she could connect with the flight back home to San Francisco. Scoot Airline personnel would not let her board her flight, without paying 90 dollars for a ""mysterious"" and spurious cancellation fee. She never cancelled. The agent had issued the tickets, there wasn't any rescheduling, but, they insisted. This was a scam to get her to pay them 90 more than likely. She did not have the money, she had spent all of her money on family in the Philippines. We are both servents of society, I was a teacher for 21-years of troubled high school students, she is a cna. We have three daughters, one being in University, money is tight. She cried, and pleaded, but, they didn't care. Why would she show up at airport if she cancelled? You can't just cancel a roundtrip, you must reschedule, or there would be flags and notifications everywhere. The flight from Singapore was still valid, and they didn't know of any cancellation. Spent two hours on a conference call with our ticketing agent and Scoot call-center. They kept saying there was a charge, but for what, there never was a cancellation. Even the manager couldn't do anything. He said that I had to write an email to the sales department, can't call, and await response! My wife is supposed to be at work. The hell they care! Don't fly Scoot or Singapore Airlines!"
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"11 March,",,"Ive flown scoot from the beginning,its a budget airline ,it gets you there
I have no complaints
lets face it, on a scoot flight it does the 3 things I need
The plane takes off
The plane flys
And the plane lands where they said it will land
Its a safe flight
I would recommend this airline to anyone"
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"01 July,",,I flew Scoot return from SYD-SIN in July/August 2012. The seats are not quite a comfortable as Air Asia but the food was as good and the entertainment is better. Both flights departed and arrived on time and the convenience of flying directly into Singapore was worth the slightly less comfortable seating. I flew Air Asia to Singapore in February 2012  and ended up spending six hours in KL's LCCT due to various delays. I'll be flying Scoot to Singapore again in October this year.
Scoot,9-Oct,ar,"15 July,",,I really enjoyed our flight from Singapore to Perth I travelled 14th July 2015. Congratulations on your staff and crew a happy group nothing was too much trouble.  Spotless toilets throughout the journey. Would not hesitate to recommend this airline.
Scoot,8-Oct,ar,"22 September,",,Well done scoot you exceeded my expectations - had a great flight from Melbourne to Singapore today - great value - excellent staff - efficient and quick check in and boarding - I will definately fly Scootbiz again 
Scoot,3-Oct,Sarah Ingram,"15 February,",,"Please see TripAdvisor for full account of story, 200 word limit impedes my ability to accurately describe how I was treated. 

I was sick on the plane. Tried to move over to a more empty row to quarantine myself from the other passengers and to be closer to the bathroom. The seats on that row cost the same as the seat I paid for (I paid for an upgrade). 1 staff member rudely asked me to move. When I explained I was sick she didnâ€™t believe me and demanded I list all my symptoms in front of the other passengers. I was humiliated. I felt bullied by this staff member and am reluctant to recommend an airline who condones such behaviour."
Scoot,4-Oct,ar,"18 December,",,"My worst experience ever.. delayed for 3 hours for a flight from Singapore to Sydney on the 19th Dec 2015. Worst still, the departure room service staff (a male Indian) was very impolite and rude in answering my concerns. What happen to the Singapore Airline reputation? If Scoot airline is managed and chosen by SQ, why such poor service?"
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"31 January,",,"Flights from Perth to Singapore and return:  Very smooth (The dreamliner is an amazing aircraft)
Food: Don't bother with the prepurchase - take your own, especially water. Meal drinks are either coke or an iced tea.
Seats: the light switch is annoyingly activated everytime you reposition your arm and the recline function is not easy to use. Take a cushion.
Toilets and carpetry: Not well maintained.
Extra-legroom seats (behind the bulkhead in the middle of the plane): passengers who purchase these have the right to refuse to let anyone past who wants to use the toilets on the other side of the plane. If the service trolley is in use you must wait until you can walk completely up the other aisle to return to your seat.
Cabin Crew: polite and friendly but will try to upsell everything.
Its a budget carrier so you get what you pay for but you fly the Dreamliner."
Scoot,3-Oct,ar,"01 September,",,"It was the our first time travelling on Scoot from Perth to Singapore and return. Based on that experience, NEVER AGAIN. I had paid extra to select our seats. It was at the boarding gate just before I went to board that I noticed that our boarding tickets had a different seat number to that which I had selected on my original booking. At no time did anyone from Scoot inform me that my original seat selection had been changed.I have personal reasons for wanting to select the seats that I selected (close to the front of the plane, but given seats at the rear of the plane), so was happy to pay extra for this, otherwise I would have not bothered to select the seat option for the booking.
Also the flight was delayed by 2 hours.
Return fight no better. Boarded plane and was seated only to be told to get off due to plane mechanical issue and wait more than 3 hours for a replacement plane.
We have flown with many other budget airlines and never had problems.
Based on our experience I can NOT RECOMMEND Scoot Airlines."
Scoot,5-Oct,ar,"07 December,",,"With our first trip in Asia, we thought we would take advantage of the discounted airlines in the region with Scoot. $500 round trip from Tokyo to Taipei for a family of four, was a steal and at the same time, too good to be true, we found out the hard way. 

Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly:

Good: Service on the plane was decent, attendants treated us with good manners and respect, responded to requests promptly, and was generally very accommodating to the passengers. 

Bad: Plane delayed for 8 hrs at Narita, since Scoot didn't have arrangements with other airlines and we didn't receive the notification email before arriving, we had to sit at the check-in area for 4 hours before being allowed to go through security where we spent an additional 5 hours. Flight was scheduled for 7pm departure but by 6:45pm, the plane was nowhere to be seen, they literally change the departure time at 7pm, very poorly communicated. Meal vouchers were provided, which was a slight plus. 

Ugly: Because Scoot uses one plane to fly through 4 different routes (Brisbane to Tokyo to Taipei to Singapore), delays at any of the locations would cause delays to all rest. "
British Airways,4-Oct,ar,"10 July,",,"Flew from Edinburgh to London city airport to catch connection to my home in Zurich. Plane type Embraer 190. However, on landing at gate 25, passengers cannot disembark until other planes close by have taken off or landed, causing a delay in getting off the plane.  A passenger then is required to walk the entire length of the airport, through baggage claim and then exit to the non-flight side. Climb stairs and go back in through security and x-ray. the queues are long and there is no concession for connecting passengers. then walk back through the entire length of the airport with the addition of negotiating a maze of shops and restaurants. I therefore got to my gate a couple of minutes late. Despite the fact that i can get on the plane with no issues. The dispatcher refused to let me on the plane, and removed my bag! Acting as if I am a bad school boy and deserves detention, not a paying customer! She even told me that her system told me I had just got off the same aircraft and that I was in the airport passing through security, and that they could see me on cc-tv. I found this unbelievable. I  then again have to walk the entire length of the airport to exit and see customer services after waiting for my bag at baggage collection. Customer services inform m, after discussing with the same dispatcher by phone,  that they consider this to be my fault and therefore will not put me on another flight and will not provide me with a hotel room either. Rules they stateâ€¦.and they claim on their adverts that they wish to serve. I am told I can purchase a new flight and go to enquiries to complain about the queues and to locate a hotel. No help at all, their attitude was also smug as they were clearly delighted to have me stranded. I promptly walked over to Swiss air desk, where the lady quickly sold me a low cost flight, despite the fact that the plane was due to leave in 45 minutes. They then quickly checking in both my bags and escorted me through security so I would pass through quickly. This BA is service! "
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"12 July,",,British Airways partners are horrible and give BA a bad name. All their partners I used in the last month were late. I will stay away from BA since they can not commot to timely schedules.
British Airways,3-Oct,ar,"19 June,",,Travelled  to las vegas on the 2 nd of june not much leg space inthe aisle  seat the stewardess  came round about one hour in the flight with the drinks i got 2 cans of lager the wife got 1 vokda and orange   when we drank them had to go and ask for more drinks to be told they had run short ?why did they not stock up at Heathrow  airport.we had the same dinner  chicken curry going and coming back no other choice it was not very nice had the same entertainment  on the flight back as coming  would  not travel again with b a  as they are  penny pinching .
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"20 March,",,"I travel around Europe a lot for work and on all the comparable airlines a drink and snack are provided free of charge. I however Bought a cup of coffee to be given it in a ""filter cup"" which made it look dirty with coffee grounds coming out of the air hole. It was so strong it was undrinkable. I asked for extra milk which didn't even change the colour of the coffee it was so strong. I believe that they may want to re think this overpriced undrinkable M & S muck."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"12 September,",,"Over time I have spent a great deal of money and time on BA flights. Mostly the continental 2h30m flight between London Heathrow, and Budapest Airport. 4 years ago the service was comparatively much better than it is today. Whereas oil prices have been plummeting recently BA flights did not become any cheaper really. And they are operating with a multiplier close to 10 when it comes to booking the last seats on a plane or in the prime flight days(fri-sun). So for a continental flight in the evening return costs Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£500 booked 2 weeks in advance. This is already quite the price but 4 years ago you would get sandwiches, salads, soft- and alcoholic drinks onboard. Nowadays you get a biscuit or a bag of crisps. Both of which are the excrement of the food industry not healthy in the slightest and the official reason for it this being a short (2h30m) flight. What happened there?"
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"29 December,",,"My mother who is 70 traveled on BA on the night of the 5th of December 2015 from Boston Logan airport to Heathrow.  She landed at 8 am.  Despite booking wheelchair services, she had no-one to assist her at the airport.  She missed her connecting flight to Mumbai as it took her longer to reach the check in counter.  Also she was subjected to security check but was at the end of the queue.  No one paid any attention to her or the other passengers who had to catch their connecting flight.  Having now missed her flight, she was given a Ã‚Â£10 coupon for food and drink.  She had to sit in the transit lounge of Terminal 5 on high back chairs.  The flight to Mumbai was at 9pm on the 6th.  I feel that the way British airways ground staff were useless.  The customer services were totally inadequate in providing me any telephone numbers to be able to contact her in Terminal 5. We were totally disgusted with her treatment and vowed that none of us will fly BA on a long haul flight."
British Airways,9-Oct,James Tozer,"14 November,",,A380 was quiet smooth very comfy seats and decent food. Slept better in economy than many airlines in business. Note that the only this BA do wrong is to Codeshare with American Airlines.
British Airways,10-Oct,ar,"27 March,",,"Always choose BA from London to Greece and the opposite .
Sometimes my flight has delay"
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"12 June,",,"My kids flew from DFW to London-heathrow on unaccompanied minor service.
the service was not so sofisticated as they explained in there website.
1.There was miscommunication at DFW airport.The person issued the boarding pass communicated saying BA member will pick kids from lobby and take them for boarding directly,we were waiting and finally no one showed up,when checked back with BA member ,they said that is not the process, and she issued gate passes to us 30mins before the takeoff.
2.The unaccompanied forms were not sent to the gate desk  .
3.AS per the details mentioned in the website ,they said kids will be provided seating close by to the cabin members,but the seating were in 10th row.
4.When kids reached the Heathrow airport ,kids didnt receive any assistance during baggage claim,kids had to pull the baggage and place in the cart."
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"09 January,",,"Firstly they offered no juice or drinks throughout the 10 hour flight from New Delhi to London(01/06/2016) .They serve dinner but as the child is sleeping they don't serve her .Breakfast in the morning was served very late and since my child was hungry ..All I got was a bag of crisps ,later when she didn't have the breakfast ,they said we don't have anything else to offer .The omelette was too heavy and the croissant was unpalatable .No fruit or juice was served .After requesting nearly thrice for a bar of chocolate (at least )all I got was a rude reply that we offered you milk .If your child can't have milk how can she have a chocolate?Or else buy chocolates when you get down at the airport..I was appalled by their behavior and their indifference ..Also if you ask the flight attendant about the menu they reply ""some vegetarian meal with vegetables maybe ..They do not know the menu at all ..My second flight from London to SFO was much better .Yet the Inflight entertainment was not working for a nearly 11 hour flight ...Is it cost cutting at its seasonal best or yet more to come..would not recommend this airlines to anyone."
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"31 October,",,"I travel to the UK several times a year to visit my boyfriend. I've always flown BA, and my only complaints are their extortionate prices and seats which are difficult to sleep in (even when you're 5'0""). The staff have always been friendly and professional. I've always felt safe and calm when flying with BA, and I am not one who typically enjoys air travel. Overnight flights in economy are never particularly comfortable, but it could definitely be worse. The meals provided are good for an airline (I always stick to pastas), but the entertainment choices are sometimes limited (though very British). I've experienced a few delays and one cancellation, but typically we arrive in a timely manner. I just wish the flights were cheaper; it's rare that they fall below $1,000 round trip. But for a nonstop, transatlantic flight, I suppose that's not bad. There are definitely other airlines that do nonstop transatlantic flights for cheaper (Virgin, for one), but if BA is your only option it's certainly not a bad one. Personally I think you get less than you pay for in economy, but if you're not terribly picky and just want to reach your destination safely and decently-fed, BA's great.

EDITORS COMMENT: Thanks for sharing your very balanced and informative review - great to read."
British Airways,9-Oct,ar,"14 February,",,"I arrived 10 minutes to closing the check in to my flight to Los Angeles with lay over in London, had forgotten my student visa and was freaking out. I was pulling out everything of my suitcase to find the visa but to no avail. The stewardesse then saved me, held the flight giving me time to fill out the ESTA and when i lost my boardingpass running to make the flight, and my bag broke and everything fell out and i fell hurting my knee, the British Airways staff was the kindest, most helpfull and overbearing crew i have ever met. I can sincerely say that I had not made this flight, which meant everything to me to finish my Masters Degree, if it hadn't been for the Danish and British crew on that Nov 8th flight from Copenhagen to London. I'm deeply grateful for handling and helping me in such a panic state. I was shaking and almost crying in my panic attack, walking onto the plane. The stewardesse immediately saw me and pulled me aside as i was entering the plane 30 min late. She gave me water and demanded i stood by her until i had drinked two cups. She smiled and calmed me down so patiently and kind. Wow, thank you - i don't know your names, but it meant the world to me!! "
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"16 February,",,"Flew London City to Glasgow International Airport and back. Mobile check in was a breeze. Seats and leg room was good for my comfort as a 5ft3in. Flight attendants and check in counter staffs were helpful, but not friendly enough to me. Take off and landings were excellent as well. I intend to fly with them back to UK in the summer. "
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"21 January,",,Flew Business from Singapore to Sydney and was most dissappointed with the seat configuration being placed in two centre seats. Service was adequate but the cabin staff didnt go out of there way to provide service.
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"17 July,",,"Was absolutely shocked to find there is no food on any flights under 5 hours, always looked forward to the breakfast. On top of that they've scrapped the unnaccompanied child rule which no makes it harder to see my younger siblings.

Flown this airline for 10 years, now is when I stop. Crap value for money, Mr Cruz is Clueless."
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"11 September,",,"Upgraded to Club Europe on outward journey for a treat. Check in queue at ""dedicated Club Europe"" desk dreadful. Staff like bouncers with no customer service skills. Heard one say to a young man ""you should have got up earlier"". Only when we got restless did they open the fence to let us go to an idle check in operator. Then the ""priority"" security process was nonsense, just as slow as elsewhere. Staff on board excellent.
On return journey I checked in online as usual. Changed our seats to the final row. Got on board to find the row had no window. Flight to full to move elsewhere. Partner a very nervous flyer and had a horrible journey back, felt he was in a coffin. All made worse by 30 min delay on departure and a further 30 min delay on being allowed to land at LHR.
Next day I contacted BA customer services online to ask why there was no indication at all on the aircraft seat plan that row 25 on Airbus 319 had no window. No response at all apart from automated ""we're busy but will get back to you asap"". A week letter I sent the same response, with original complaint number, again online. No response at all, not even the automated one.
I'm left feeling that BA is now RyanAir."
British Airways,0 / 10,Alison Spencer,"09 August,",,"Dreadful airline that has got worse over the years. Oversells its seats and has no one to deal with this. Loses baggage. Has no hot drinks nor sandwiches on short flights.
Unlikely to ever use again."
British Airways,10-Oct,ar,"02 March,",,Travelling as a disabled passenger with mobility needs and special dietary requirements I was apprehensive.  From the moment I arrived at the airport I was treated with extreme courtesy and help at every point. I particular on the flight from Tampa to Gatwick the cabin staff were exceptional. I would like to comment on the Cabin supervisor Nicola Hooper who went out of her way to ensure I was comfortable and well taken care of.  Such a joy to find traditional service standards are still in place. I know why I never travel with any other airline. It is predictably excellent.
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"17 November,",,"I booked flights with BA from London-Kuala Lumpur-Bandar-Kuala Lumpur-London. These were all booked at the same time and they also took the booking, therefore contract, with Royal Brunei Airlines (RBI) for the KL/Bandar/KL legs.
For whatever reason RBI cancelled one of the flights, and it was only by accident that I found this out, by going on the BA website. I had to change a flight and waste a day in Brunei.
BA have refused all responsibility, even on the lack of communicating the cancelled flight to me. I find this deplorable after booking everything through BA.

I would certainly never book anything direct with BA again, as this lack of service by a major carrier to a customer is despicable."
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"12 August,",,"The British Airways flight staff were absolutely wonderful!  The food was great.  The plane, however, was old and the in-flight entertainment sub-par.  The sound and video quality of the movies were scratchy and fuzzy.  I had to keep adjusting the arm of my chair just to get enough sound to hear the movie.  People should be advised to bring their own entertainment.  "
British Airways,3-Oct,GORDON YONG,"31 August,",,"flight from US city to Heathrow T5 for transit to Naples; Milan to T5 and back to US city.  BA website for online check-in not working as per standard SOP for many airlines. Fee required to select seats. Aerobridges must hate BA planes.  Besides the US city, none worked in Europe or BA went cheap. Seat planning is atrocious. Was seated with anti-social parents with kids at my front and back on return. Hellish flight, hardly got sleep and attendants did nothing to curb noise levels from this family.  Would not select BA again."
British Airways,9-Oct,ar,"20 March,",,"Edinburgh to London Heathrow - Check-in was excellent friendly, efficient & very helpful, was taking Qatar Airways out of LHR the following day & now that they are Oneworld members BA were happy to check bags all the way to Dubai even with overnight at LHR.

British Airways,6-Oct,Mary Aubertin,"30 November,",,"I flew Business class to and from Europe on American Airlines and British Airways.  The sleeping accommodations on the AA plane were much more private and comfortable than on the return flight on the British Airways plane.  The food on the AA plane was much better.  The food on the BA plane, except the Bangers and mash and the chicken, was abominable, absolutely horrible.  I would not fly BA again if I had to go through Heathrow and my final destination of Vienna.  There were no jetbridges to the planes. I had to walk up numerous steep flights of stairs in the terminal and on the tarmac into the plane carrying a moderately heavy carryon.  I also have knee and foot medical problems and some dizziness after a fall while I was in Europe, so those stairs created a dangerous situation for me and undoubtedly for the elderly patrons who were accessing and egressing the planes.  The ground transportation was crowded and in the era of covid, unsafe."
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"14 October,",,"I took a short flight from Ibiza to London, The staff actually had a sense of humour. The crew on the flight deck were very informative of any changes in our situation including the weather. Full service with a meal and drinks on a 2 hour flight. This was my first flight with this airline.

EDITORS COMMENT: Sounds like a pretty good flight!"
British Airways,9-Oct,ar,"12 June,",,We flew from London Gatwick to Alicante in May and the flight on-board the 737-400 was excellent the staff were friendly and helpful and the aircraft was clean and comfortable. We received a lovely free in flight meal rare now due to low cost carriers as well as a free hot drink. It has to have been the best short haul flight I have ever been on.
British Airways,4-Oct,Alireza Nasser,"11 March,",,"Delayed flight, long wait in transit for over 12hours with a senior and 6 children, no empathy only to be informed two of us couldnâ€™t board the connecting flight due to no e-visas which wasnâ€™t accounted for at boarding from home country. Stranded in London for 3 days with no bags. Wife and children separated from me and stuck in another country all alone. Extremely rude staff. When filed a claim upon my return all they did was apologize for their rude staff and inconvenience and ask for receipts as proof which I didnâ€™t have due to the chaotic nature of the journey and therefore they denied my claim with no compensation. I donâ€™t understand how they expect 9 passengers to have lived unexpectedly in foreign countries for 3 days without any expenses? Shame on BA because I will never fly with them again. They did nothing to make this matter right."
British Airways,9-Oct,Caspar Burgess,"31 August,",,"Very high quality experience. The seats are comfortable, the food is good and usually the trip is smooth. Would recommend"
British Airways,4-Oct,Ken Murray,"09 August,",,"Poor customer experience in Club Europe - no priority boarding, poor food quality and they said that they didnâ€™t have Champagne (as advertised) due to â€œsupply issuesâ€."
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"06 October,",,"Inbound flight to PHL via LHR in Coach and World Traveller Plus was quite ok. The hospitality and the kindness of the staff is widly spreading. One flight attendant hit me with his cabin scooter and did not even excused himself whereas another one was extremely kind in helping me with some issues at my seat.
The outbound flight was quite bad. World Traveller Plus cabin was overbooked (which seems to be the reason for the trouble that I had with reserving seats - see below). Instead of just upgrading the people (business  was only half full) they tried to find some people for using the next flight. Caused delay as no one wanted to use the next one (as this was the last flight out of PHL for that day).
The experience on board was very good this time.
Food is very good in World Traveller Plus.

My biggest problem with BA is customer support: I had problems with getting a reservation of a seat. I tried to select a seat (no bassinet!) that was shown  as free and get an error message. Two times I contacted the customer service hotline but there were not able to help and I got another information every single time. My complaint email was not answered till now (four weeks now)."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"05 October,",,"Over four hour delay which was entirely British Airway's fault and down to engineers being called out and paperwork taking a long time to be signed off. Long distance flight to Qatar.  I have written over eight communications to British Airways Customer Service to claim compensation. It has been almost two months and not a single communication has been acknowledged- whether by online form, email or hard copy letter posted by recorded delivery. Waiting over half an hour on the phone to speak with Customer Relations. This is incredibly poor customer service. I'll be avoiding BA going forwards. - very negative experience."
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"12 August,",,"After booking a quick, half emergency return ticket at the airport, for which I payed about 600 euro's too much, I had to change the date and place of return.
Spent 6-7 hours on the phone with different people all telling me different things. One person said changing is possible, the other person said it was not. One person told me I can cancel the ticket, another told me I can't.

They just threw random information at me all the time and couldn't help me, I was unable to change my ticket in any way I wanted - and it was a very reasonable request, within a 15 day time span.

Bedause I booked it at the British Airway desk at the airport, the ticket was registered as if it was booked by a travel agent. However, I did not get the promised email or information, and could not contact this desk at all.

In short, I just feel scammed. I've been toyed around with and they sucked all the money out of me they could. For the first and last time, as I'm spreading the word joyfully that this airline is one to avoid at all costs."
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"25 February,",,Unfortunate to have paid a huge amount to travel economy from  Arlanda Stockholm. To T5 Heathrow. You have to pay for a cup of tea and your food. The flight crew were rushed off their feet. Ordered food at start of flight and had to chase it twice and received it when we were nearly home.  There was little chance to buy any duty frees even. It's EasyJet service at extortionate prices and they are not even anywhere as good as EasyJet! Had to provide passport details  along with my credit card details for products under Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£30.00. Would never use again out of choice. Absolutely awful.
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"12 February,",,"On Wednesday 27 April 2011 a travel agent advised my wife of a fare of $796,
on British Airways, saying that it would be necessary
to book and pay by Friday 29 April.

That evening I looked on the British Airways website and at an online travel
agent's website, and confirmed this information (the fares varied slightly,
which I took to be slightly differing agent's commissions).

On the following day (Thursday 30 April), after we had planned a trip,
this fare appeared to be no longer offered,
but a fare of about $915 was offered instead.
(after checking two travel agents and the BA website,
which again, offered very similar fares).

The discrepancy in amounts was not due to changing availability of seats -
mostly the above information relates to what I was told before we looked
at which dates the required number of seats was available.

That is, they advertised that a fare would be available until Friday,
and then discontinued it basically overnight.

This seems like ""bait advertising"", which in the case of retail shops in Australia, is illegal, and certainly unethical.  It certainly had that effect - getting me
to come along having planned a purchase, only to tell me the price was more
than I had, based on their advertising, confidently expected.
EDITORS COMMENT: Generally you will find that in the fine print it will say ""until set number of seats has sold"" or something to that effect. It is frustrating though but every airline does it"

British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"07 November,",,"Qatar-Bahrain, It was a very short flight, hard to write home about it! but I will be fair to them, they were very friendly and accommodating! It was a total shock as I had horrendous experiences with other European carriers and I do my best to avoid them. Legroom was good, flight on time, and we got a soft drink for a 15 minutes flight, would fly them again due to low price."
British Airways,3-Oct,ar,"13 April,",,"I was very disappointed by BA.
First of all, we had a delay of almost one hour which is unacceptable. I'm not absurd, I can accept a delay of 10-15 minutes, but not an hour.
When we were finally ready for take off, the passenger seated in my front, lowered the back of his seat (which it's forbidden) and when I asked the flight attendant to ask the passenger to raise it, he said with a superior attitude ""We are not flying yet"". The airplane was already on the runway ready to take off.
When was time to serve the food, they said ""We have only Chicken Curry"". How is possible to have only Chicken Curry? What about the vegetarians and vegans? It's outrageous to serve only chicken curry!
I'm very disappointed and this was the last time when I will fly with BA!"
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"09 December,",,"Just returned from flight by British Airways (First Class) from Delhi to London.
Complained to BA about the following: delay in boarding, tv system not working properly and only having one meal and snack for a 9 1/2 hour flight. Could not even supply cheese and biscuits. Airport Lounge used in Delhi ok but not a great variety of meals on offer.On the flight I expected air staff to offer to turn your seat into bed and dim the lights for the flight. This did not happen and on arrival had to wait 20 mins for luggage and when I asked BA staff at Heathrow just said they could not do anything it was the way the plane was packed in Delhi and continued with their conversation. We were lucky enough to fly with Virgin last year and it was tons better.
Wish I had gone with Virgin again. Did complain to BA and had to wait for four days before I got a reply from customer services who basically said will pass your comments on to various departments but no apology. Definitely not worth the money to fly in first class.

EDITORS COMMENT: The baggage thing really is out of the airlines control I agree with that but as for the rest of it I too would have expected those services you mention on a first class flight!"
British Airways,4-Oct,,"11 January,",,"an absolute shambles at Frankfurt airport coupled with a complete indifference from British Airways staff left us in a queue which took longer than the time available to get to the plane. An extremely rude member of staff then proceeded to lie to us about calling all passengers for London City, yet this simply wasn't true. plane took off with just 16 passengers on board. British Airways reluctantly re booked us on a KLM flight the next day which was so much better than the very indifferent British Airways flight."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"11 May,",,"I was very disappointed that during my 4 hour flight from Athens Greece to London, I was required to buy ALL drinks/snacks an food, as was everyone else on the flight! Not even water was offered! Everyone had to pay high prices for food and drink on board with a credit card! Even the smaller European companies offer free food and drink on their European flights... shame on BA!!"
British Airways,5-Oct,Paul Swain,"04 July,",,"Years ago I swore to never fly British Airways again due to their shocking service, attitude and flight cancellations. I decided to recently give them another go for a flight from Nice to London 11.50am arriving 12.40pm so I could attend a meeting in the afternoon, only to have BA cancel my flight at the last minute because they didn't fill the plane and putting me on another flight at 8pm than night getting in at 10pm!!
What am i meant to do with that! I only have two days in London and my itinerary is tight.
So I advise go Eazy Jet or Wiz as they are of the same standard only much cheaper. save your money and don't fly BA."
British Airways,2-Oct,Andrew Peachey,"09 August,",,"My flight with BA from Gibraltar to LHR was cancelled several hours prior to departure. I had a connecting flight booked from LHR to Vancouver the following day, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had â€œabandonedâ€ travel with them, they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. When I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I ended up incurring costs of Â£700 in airfare, hotel, and meals. This airline has definitely gone downhill."
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"26 June,",,"We fly to the UK from NZ at Christmas and have done so for well over twenty years every year. In the early days we could fly BA all the way from Auckland and return.Now we have to pop over to Sydney to pick up BA (Via Singapore) there. Since those early days we have used a variety of Airlines. We are Qantas frequent flyers. Always liked BA they do things very well and the crew are always great, Hardware getting a bit dated now and I swear we flew late last year in the same 747-400 as we did twenty years ago.. ah the familiar song of the  Rolls Royce  211s was great. To enhance the Sydney to Singapore leg we were upgraded to World Traveller plus so it really did make our holiday get off to a good start. We liked the whole flight experience. Look forward to flying again but with newer aircraft."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"29 January,",,"I flew to Manchester on Friday 27th January from Heathrow Terminal 5. As usual with BA the flight was in time and the crew were excellent.  What was really disappointing is that we now no longer get a complimentary drink. In effect is BA now a low cost carrier?  If so that is sad as BA for me as always about quality.  Can I urge you to re-think your strategy.

EDITORS COMMENT: Unfortunately they had to do it to remain competitive. "
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"25 September,",,"BA is a great airline company. Tha staff onboardare very friendly, and there is great in flight entertainment. "
British Airways,2-Oct,ar,"13 January,",,I have to say that it was the first time I fly with BA and for sure it will be the last time! I missed my flight that was at 9 coz I was late for 5min even though I did my boarding at6:30 and was late coz of the weight issues and the stupidity of the employees they made me pay extra which i dont mind if they treated me right and not each employee said a different thing than the other and made me late so when i got to the gate they already have taken my bag of the plane! First time I hear such thing could happen how did they do that just for being late for 5min and without even calling my name or searching for me knowing I did my boarding and then yelking at me and being so rude and not helpful at all and I had to pay 100 pounds to rebook for the next day only to get back on an old dirty plane with no screens and bad service for 5 hours and the most shock was that a women entered the plane before it took off by  5min!!!!! So how did she enter when the day before I was yelled at and pushed of the gate.. I have never ever in my life witnessed such bad rude treatment!!! 
British Airways,10-Oct,ar,"04 January,",,"I have experienced both Economy and Business Class on British Airways. I enjoyed both experiences. They were very friendly, particularly on Business Class. The food and beverages are as good as any other airline - pretty good. I travelled with my Family so we sat in a row, on Business Class. However, if you're travelling alone, I am pretty sure it be a bit of a trouble. It would be a ten star, as it has very comfy seats, and I had a great experience, but on one of the Business Class flights, my mother spilt tea on her blanket, and they were unable to provide another one, which was a bit of poor service. However, overall, I have had good experiences on both Economy and Business Class."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"21 August,",,"from Bwi to Barcelona. Lost our luggages. we went to the cruise 8 days without clothing. BA kept saying the luggages will arrive the next day. 8 days went by. No luggages. Ruined our trip. couldn't participate any functions on the ship because we didn't have appropriate clothes. Ship didn't sell any clothes that fits us. Couldn't buy clothes on our ports because we had to participate our excursions from 7am-6 pm(when the ship leave). Lugguages was finally deliver to our resident 8 days after we got home.  No sorry, no compensation from BA. Will never ever fly with them again. "
British Airways,5-Oct,Michael Barron,"23 November,",,"British airways is always late, their website is atrocious, and they won't let you checkin until 24 hours before the flight and then tell you that you must do it at the airlines because it is less than 24 hours.  I have been trying for 6 hours to check in and/or find a real person to speak with.  Finally customer service had such a thick accent I didn't think they were speaking English. Avoid this airline."
British Airways,4-Oct,Amr EL Tagoury,"05 December,",,"The worst flight even in business class the flight between Cairo airport & London Heathrow ( via verse) . The airplane is designed to fly internal Europe only for maximum 2 hours trip and not to be used for more than 5 hours trip . The business class seat was very small, not full flat bed , no screen or any type of entertainment provided for 5 hours trip . I traveled through BA to USA yearly in business class during the last 14 years , but on the last 3 years they started using this small airplane for this medium distance trip which not comfortable at all and doesnâ€™t met the value of money which paid in this business class trip"
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"25 March,",,"I flew BA First from LHR to MIA. It was an airbus A380. Row 1 means you are secluded because of the stairs and you are the last person the crew notice as the galley is behind row 4.

On my outbound flight I had a wonderful time watching movies but felt ignored by the crew. There are only 14 seats in first class!

On my return flight, I felt I got a great deal of attention. However, the flat bed was uncomfortable and the cabin was cold. This is not the crews fault but they need warm blankets. It's a function of the system.

Now we get to the food. They ran out of my food option on my outbound flight. I am travelling first. How does that happen?

Apparently it is to do with the tasting menu and  how many people choose it.

On my return flight I was offered dinner and got some beef which was, for me, over cooked.

I wish airlines would be honest and say that your taste buds will change in the controllef air at 30k feet.

Having had a full English Breakfast where the bacon has been made to look like it was fried but wasn't was so irritating.

I will never fly First again because there just wasn't the added value."
British Airways,2-Oct,,"03 January,",,"If your B.A. flight is delayed, and more importantly youâ€™ll miss your connection due to the delay, donâ€™t expect much help from B.A. staff at Glasgow Airport. If this happens to you, make sure the B.A. Customer Relations staff (who arenâ€™t actually B.A staff!) given the reason for delay, when they would be able to get you on the next connection to get you to your final destination, and if they were unable to get a suitable flight with another airline in writing. Youâ€™ll need this if you ultimately need to claim on your travel insurance. Make sure to do this before leaving the airport. The B.A. website is not easy to navigate to find the correct link for any claim. Their Customer Relations number (0344 493 0787) is also likely to cut out on you and even while talking to someone in Customer Relations (that happened to me on more than one occasion). When you do eventually get to speak to a rep, donâ€™t necessarily believe what they say. If they say your refund claim has been put through there and then, donâ€™t believe them. If you find your refund hasnâ€™t entered your bank account 6 days later, donâ€™t believe the next rep who says itâ€™ll be in your account within 24hrs. The next rep I spoke to, 10 days after making the claim, stated they should have said the money wouldnâ€™t be refunded until at least 10 days later! Shoddy service. If the rep you speak to about refunds informs you that you have to take another phone option in order to claim for anything other than flights, be wary. I was told that due to the time I was on, that this other department wouldnâ€™t open until 09.00hrs the following dayâ€¦wrong! They didnâ€™t open until 13.00-17.00hrs. Also, the rep made no comment (having been made aware of the circumstances) that my claim for loss of hotel and trips costs would not be refunded. Between the number of phone calls I have made, the time spent on the phone and internet, Iâ€™ve effectively cost myself a fair amount of the money Iâ€™m wanting to get refunded! Always remember that legally, you may be entitled (I believe) to up to Â£300 each for any delay over 3hrs (per â€œEC Regulation 261/2004â€). Not that B.A. will tell you. If your claim is rejected, you can ask the Civil Aviation Authority (or the European Consumer Centre in certain non-UK departures) whether it believes you are entitled to compensation. Worth a try. Considering what I asked for is substantially less than that, they still arenâ€™t helpful. Despite having used B.A. before, and have other flights already arranged, B.A. have gone down in my estimation (I now see why Iâ€™ve heard so many negative comments about B.A. over the last couple of years). Unless there is no other option, I would seriously consider using another airline. It couldnâ€™t be any worse."
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"01 June,",,"Only fly BA 40% of my business trips now (do 70 flights a year) as the lack of free food and drink has changed my experience of BA. If they are going to penny pinch, then so am I!  I now use EasyJet and Wizzair from Luton which are much cheaper and he experience is the same. Actually you could say the experience is better as although the Terminal at Luton is a dump at the moment, the planes take off much quicker as it is not as congested as Heathrow. Get rid of Alex Cruz he is ruining a great British brand ! So sad....."
British Airways,10-Oct,,"25 August,",,"My mother and I really enjoyed flying from Heathrow to Frankfurt and back with British Airways earlier this month! We found the staff very polite and attentive to our needs and they even moved us to better seats as there were some better seats vacant. The price was excellent (though we did admittedly book 6 months in advance), however we would have appreciated a free drink and snack on board, which I believe BA used to offer until recently (now everything has to be bought unless you are travelling in Business Class)."

British Airways,4-Oct,ar,"04 February,",,"First flight with new and improved value menu from Marks and Spencers (BAs words not mine) and it was surprisingly empty. Not sure if it is a trend. The newish Airbus 320 configuration includes extra row in the first 11 rows which means to compensate for less legroom, the seat rake has been reduced to uncomfortable. I didn't buy any of their expensive sandwiches or drinks. I bought a bottle of water on board with me. Flying less with BA these days as they have reduced to being an expensive low cost airline. I prefer Easyjet now."
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"22 January,",,"Flew DC-Heathrow on a brand new A380. Checked in online and reserved seats on the upper deck but prior to boarding they put us on lower deck explaining the ones we wanted were broken.

Tickets were the cheapest among all airlines but now I know why. "
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"26 May,",,This is the flight I am never going to prefer to take again  or prefer my friends or family to take it. They don't provide wheel chair service properly in London. My parents suffered a lot. Also my kids when they did go to vacation we had a very bad experience as the flight was cancelled and the customer service for rescheduling and seating was very poor. They were not even showing their apologies for the cancellation and no courtesy given for that. I really disappointed with this airlines.

Service was reasonably good, that promises of a newspaper on one flight and paracetamol did not eventuate. Range of food and drinks somewhat restricted. Food to London was very disappointing, but food on the return leg was tasty and satisfying. BUT, business seating is terrible: feels like a coffin in your cubicle - very narrow and nowhere to put anything. BA puts eight seat across, while others put only six, even on larger planes such as the A380. Sorry BA, I used to enjoy business on the 747s, but the B77 experience has put me off completely: the standard is not even as good as other airlines' premium economy offerings."
British Airways,3-Oct,ar,"06 January,",,"I have spent the past 9 years travelling between the UK and Thailand, with various airlines. Where BA is concerned, neither the food, hospitality or entertainment can compare with that of  Etihad, Emirates or Qatar, none of which I experienced delays with. The only airline I did endure a delay with was BA. The delay meant that I missed my pre-booked trains and incurred costs of almost 90 pounds. I tried to claim my expenses but BA arrogantly denied responsibility. They also informed me that they were not a member of the ombudsman scheme set up to ensure consumers get a fair deal. This itself suggests that they put profit above customer satisfaction.
Where there is a choice I would strongly recommend flying with one of the other airlines and only using BA as a last resort"
British Airways,7-Oct,Phil Rome,"26 June,",,Terrible.  Flew first class.  They canceled my initial flight and had to rebook but their computer system was down for a day and a half.

British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"26 April,",,"For those who want the nutshell, we were booked on a British Airways flight from San Francisco to New Delhi with a connection in London Heathrow.  Our flight to London was late so we missed our connection.  We were rebooked with a 90 minute connection through Munich.  This flight was also late.  We were then rebooked with a 60 minute connection through Paris and this flight also took off late.  With each rebooking, I asked for a longer connection and the agent argued and guaranteed there would be no delays.  We refused another connection in Paris and were put on the direct flight the next day.  My husband's suitcase was sent from London to Delhi on a BA flight.  We found this out from the Air France agent when we were in Paris.  When we arrived in Delhi, we spent 5 hours arguing with the BA desk before they released our suitcase.  Someone from another airline informed us that there was a fee to get the suitcase out of storage and the airlines did not want to pay.  The fee was approximately 6 US dollars.  When we found out the real situation we said we would pay the fee.
We will never fly British Airways again and hope you do not either.  For those who want the details, see below:
COMPLETE INCOMPETENCE WILL NEVER FLY AGAIN
My review is very overdue.  I booked a trip from San Francisco to New Delhi in Dec 2012.  The connection was in London Heathrow.  First we missed our connection in Heathrow because our flight from SFO was late.  They put us on a new flight connecting through Munich that had a 90 minute connection.  I asked for a longer connection, but the airline insisted I would be fine.  The flight to Munich was late.  We missed our connection again.  The airline did retrieve my suitcase & put us in a hotel.  They also rebooked us on another BA flight the next morning to Paris, then on an Air France flight to New Delhi.  This time the connection was 60 minutes.  The airline promised there will be no delay.  They said the flight is the first flight in the morning and there will NOT be a delay.  They took us to an outdoor location to catch the shuttle for the hotel.  Well it was snowing in Germany.  We stood there for 30 minutes then realized we were in the wrong location.  Locals were kind enough to direct us to the proper shuttle stop.  We had 2 hours of sleep.  The next morning we boarded the plane.  However, the plane sat on the ground for 60 minutes.  They underestimated how much time was needed to board the luggage.  Then after loading the plane they had to de-ice the plane.  We knew we missed our connection.When we arrived in Paris the Air France informed us my husband's suitcase had been sent to New Delhi from London on a British Airways flight and would be in New Delhi when we arrived.
We refused another connection in Paris and stayed in a hotel that night.  The next day we arrived in New Delhi.  The BA luggage desk said the suitcase is in the warehouse and it will be an hour before someone can bring it out.  We waited the hour.  Someone new was at the desk.  They told us to talk to Air France since we arrived on Air France.  Air France said they cannot help us because the suitcase arrived on a BA flight.  To make matters worse.  Air France and BA were standing at the same table & refusing to talk to each other.  My husband and I were screaming at the fact that they had our luggage but would not relinquish it.  Those around us swore they would never fly BA again.  Finally, a gentleman from a 3rd airline explained that the suitcase was in a government warehouse and you had to pay a fee to get it out.  He said neither airline wanted to pay.  The price was 6 US dollars.  BA said it's not about the money and paid the fee.  Also, the warehouse was located behind the desk & someone was in the room when we initially arrived. Everyone I have told this story too will never fly BA again.  I hope those reading this will also never fly this airline. I am not someone who cuts off an entire business for one bad experience, but I will NEVER fly BA again!"
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"21 July,",,"The baggage check in took for ever it was (I am certain)45-50min of standing in the queue. The flight looked good and well maintained 777. In flight entertainment was good and updated to latest movies,documentaries,talk shows 5* for that . The seating space was just about good enough. Be careful of the head set it can come in the way and snap. The air conditioner was not up to the mark it was warm in the cabin. The flight attended's will give you a big smile BUT be careful. The in flight food was so hot that it turned black when in contact with oxygen.In short it was burnt, one can see the burnt food particles once the burnt food is moved looks like a lovely trick .The answer of the flight crew to some one asking for second helping of 150ml coke can is that we need to keep stock for the return flight can't keep serving everyone twice.This was the first time in 12+yr of international travel to hear this excuse.The worst but with a smile.... flight was on time."
British Airways,4-Oct,,"02 April,",,"Who is telling the truth? This is an update to my recent review of BA â€˜Not fit for purposeâ€™. In it I described the incident where a cabin crew member spilled wine in my lap. On return home I made a modest claim for the both my Chinos and Shirt, which were ruined. Response from BAâ€”â€”â€” â€œNot accepted because no cabin crew member entered the incident in the flight log!!!!!â€ So, I am a liar, eh? This nastiness after buying a flight ticket for almost Â£1700. Would us Britishers not believe that our national carrier would act honourably? Totally disgraceful."
British Airways,9-Oct,ar,"09 September,",,"My experience with British Airways a few years back was very poor. However, they seem to have improved extremely well both with the interior comfort with the airline but also with passenger service. Recently flew from the UK to and from Europe on three occasions in Business Class and have absolutely no complaints at all. "
British Airways,8-Oct,,"14 February,",,"We flew BA business from Helsinki to London on an A320, one of the longer European flights and so perhaps one of the few where the upgrade may be justifiable.  The meal was very pleasant, and a step up from nothing in Economy!  As with many European airlines, the seats themselves are no different, rather you get the extra legroom and they just don't fill the middle seat in the 3-3 layout.  So the extra comfort level is only marginal"
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"16 March,",,"I used BA for fifty flights in Europe last year and enjoyed my free snacks and drinks. Now, there is nothing free, just cabin crew blocking the aisle when you need to go to the loo as they are too busy taking money.  I have found Wizz Air from Luton to do a lot of my flights to Europe now. Just as good but cheaper.  BA- you have killed off your brand reputation in less than 6 months. You were a National carrier for the people of the UK. Isn't a 20% operating margin good enough for you. So sad...."
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"02 September,",,This is the first time travelling with british airways with my husbans and 3 kids. my only bad experience was the meals. My kids didnt like the food. They didnt eat anything. Even me and my husband hardly ate anything its better if u make maybe fish and potatoes and a box of snacks for kids or maybe rice and salmon. Just some small advice.. it doesnt cost that much. Other than that everything is amazing i highly recommend it. When i took BMI last year the food was amazing. Im looking forward to my summer holiday with british airways so they can make better food. the only mistake i made is i got my tickets from the expedia website but on my next summer holiday im gonna get it from british airways 
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"08 July,",,"I recently flew British airways from Hong Kong to London BA 0026 on 25 th June 2013.  When booking my ticket I was offered to upgrade to world traveller plus from world traveller for this flight, which I accepted and paid for.
After boarding the flight and eating my meal I tried to recline the seat back to sleep, as it was a night flight.  However the seat did not recline at all.  Two males crew members tried to move the seat back as well but it was broken.  I asked to be moved back to economy to a seat that reclined, however, the flight was full and they were unable to do that.
British Airways have refused to refund to me the cost of the upgrade despite the fact that the seat was faulty."
British Airways,6-Oct,Andre Redelinghuys,"08 October,",,"The business class seating layout is just not functional or comfortable. Other passengers have to climb over your legs once your seat is in Lay flat position, often waking you up or bumping you. Meal services is done over you for passengers next to you which is also irritating, especially if you want to have the dividing screen up. My  main meal was served warm instead of hot which was very disappointing."
British Airways,9-Oct,ar,"20 January,",,"Very good company, yesterday when I was coming back from Bangkok to London I missed my flight, because I feel asleep on the airport during my healthy conditions (sleepless night before and food poison). They made me big favour and booked next available flight (next day) free of charge. Never happen to me with other different airways. I also would like to mention that Im not British. Big thank you to British Airways."
British Airways,10-Oct,ar,"30 November,",,"My husband and I flew from London to Johannesburg on the 18th November and had the most wonderful service from the crew! I was 31 weeks pregnant and Elaine who was in charge or the cabin bent over backwards to accommodate us with a special request. Thank you Elaine for everything, you really were outstanding! I look forward to traveling with BA again in the near future!"
British Airways,4-Oct,ar,"11 March,",,"Would not recommend. Awful food and beverage service - only served water with main meal on 9 hour flight. No beer available at all by time I asked perhaps 2 hours into flight and they ran out of wine after I had one glass after finally having a drink after the meal.

Seats were dirty and had food stains

Tv screen was broken and literally hanging off the back of seat so managed to get moved by the only nice member of staff I came across.

Would avoid BA if flying to USA (London Heathrow to vegas)"
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"29 July,",,"I just returned from a European trip.  The flight was from London to Philadelphia.  Great staff and nice meals; however, the airplane seats were very small and crampy.  To spend 7.5 hours with someone almost laying in your lap is a bit much.  I've flown other airlines and this was a first for me.  I would not recommend nor consider this airline for international flights. "
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"30 March,",,"I flew British Airways from Denver to London, then Mumbai to London to Denver.  Seats are cramped and uncomfortable - while the spacing would be ok for a domestic flight under 3 hours, it was miserable.  Crew was friendly and professional, food was good."
British Airways,2-Oct,ar,"01 June,",,"After arriving at London Heathrow from Phnom Penh via Doha (taking 22 hours at 11.30am) for a connecting flight BA1332 to Newcastle on 02 May 2014. British Airways refused to board us due to some computer ticketing glitch, insisting we had to contact our travel agent in Phnom Penh (by which time it was after 10,00 pm there) refusing to accept our printed itinerary booking or the copy of the payment and Visa vouchers showing we had fully paid for the booking with them.  BA also insisted that they would not have our baggage, despite being checked through to NCL as denoted by the baggage labels, making us return to T5 for a fruitless effort back to Qatar Airways, when all the time it was on their stack at T5.  The QA office, however gave us a print out to say  that in fact we were booked on a later BA flight to NCL, but once again, BA ground staff.....eventually.... refused to board us. Some unnamed person, at the end of a telephone, simply informed the BA counter staff ""there is nothing we can do!"".  We left LHR by bus 6 hours after first landing there, and arrived in Newcastle 25 hours late after two bus journeys and an overnight stay.

BA has replied twice to us so far, but has still not explained what went wrong, who was to blame, or how any traveller can make sure it does not happen again.  As I am from the UK, with access to my bank account, and a UK sim card for the phone, at least I knew how to get to my destination - how would BA and LHR deal with a foreign visitor?  No-one offered any help whatsoever.  The first reply from the Civil Aviation Authority suggests that what happened to us does not fit in with the ""refused boarding"" regulations!"
British Airways,2-Oct,Matt Hoch,"20 January,",,"Mean people, middle seats for long haul business, tiny seats, poor wines, poor food.  Why would anyone fly them?  They are like what American airlines were like 30 years ago.  AVOID at all costs!  I fly to Africa via IAD to avoid."
British Airways,4-Oct,Pamie Cheah,"12 June,",,"A national disgrace.

2 confirmed business class flights were cancelled, 1 without notice upon arrival at the airport, the other with zero notice until I tried to check in online 24 hrs prior.

Very unreliable, with average service on board and very average lounge.

They also decided to bump my business ticket to economy upon rebooking me for a next flight.

The last thing you want on a long European trip is an unreliable airline with zero empathy. Fly with someone else, BA should be your very last choice."
British Airways,4-Oct,ar,"16 October,",,"It's always horrible to have to fly economy class and British Airways is not different. That is the sad standard.
But what is totally inacceptable is the fact that BA sold me a flight connection that they already knew even before I started my trip I couldn't make the connecting flight.
I had to reach a connecting flight at LHR and even though the plane landed on time I was already denied to board my next flight before even having gone through security check. There never was going to be enough time to catch the connecting flight and thus we were rebooked to a later one. Even though this caused a delay of ""only"" two hours (I don't know about you, but time is very precious to me and is should be to the airlines as well, by force if necessary) it is completely inacceptable. Because if I would have known this while booking my flights perhaps I would have decided to go for a different one with a different airline in the first place."
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"29 May,",,"Have flown Club Europe many times, but have seen a decline in standards over the last year or two. The food now offered was terrible on a flight from Palma to Heathrow. An unedible greasy mess called a hot chicken sandwich. The new service of one crew member taking orders for food and drink, and returning to the galley after each order is slow, why ditch the trolley? Now wine is served from a bottle, but trying to get a second glass, is one long wait. The whole experience was depressingly poor. Cheap food, slow service, less room, really has got a lot worse. No longer a premium service."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"17 April,",,"Flew with BA to and from Moscow over Easter 2017. The plane was old, seats cover reminded of unclean grey carpet. On the way to Moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were getting stuck so had to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor. The food itself was miserable - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as I noticed while queuing for toilet (and there were only two for a fully booked economy class).
On the way back to London had a seat in the middle of the salon with so little leg space that I literally could not even cross my legs as my knees were stuck into the seat in front. Seats were not reclining either. The food was even worse than on the inbound flight - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stone-cold cheese and onion small ban and hot drinks were only served once over 4 four hours flight. Do not fly BA. It employs tactics of EasyJet albeit the latter is superior in comfort and customer service. "
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"03 August,",,I feel the standard of BA is slipping. Staff appear to know less and are less willing to do what they consider the bare minimum in their remit. For family travel I have had superior experience on other airlines especially considering the extra paid for business class flights.
British Airways,6-Oct,Sue Main,"23 June,",,Oh BA wtf you have turned yourself into a Ryan air without the cheap prices! I have flown for 18 years to Aberdeen from LHR...you now charge for seat allocation...fine except before you brought this in i was always pre allocated a window or aisle seat...since you brought this in i now am always pre allocated a middle seat! Really! I suspect you pre allocate everyone now into middle seats even when theres not enough to make us pay our Â£6 to move....pathetic...national carrier you are a national disgrace the only reason i fly with you is because i want to fly from Heathrow....not Luton or Stanstead....god how i wish easyjet flew to Aberdeen from Heathrow....would i ever use BA for my regular lnghaul to Australia oh god no no no way .....crappy crappy nasty without the crappy nasty cheap prices as a national carrier you are an embarassment!
British Airways,4-Oct,,"12 February,",,"I fly with the Oneworlders to London at least 3-4 times a month. BA used to be worth it, not anymore. You dont pay ur people well, you get untrained and/or unhappy staff and u feel it. And more than once in Heathrow on the train to B or C I had to ask crew that I really dont want to hear why they will be miserable later... talk bad about BA in LHR in Uniform surrounded by passengers... wow overall: badly trained, bad mood, arrogant .. no thanks... did I say I was saphire?"
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"22 March,",,"Comfortable flight from LHR to SFO. Cabin crew were attentive and friendly, and happy to fetch additonal refreshments during the flight. Food was fairly good, although it was all unhealthy carbs and sugar, no fresh fruit or vegetables whatsoever. Plenty of entertainment options for all tastes. Overall, I was pleased with my experience."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"21 June,",,"We flew World Traveller Plus a few years ago, Melbourne to London. What we got for the extra cost was negligible, maybe a bit more leg room. The special lumbar cushions did not work and we were right in front of the toilets, so could not recline very well and had to put up with constant flushing noises.  The staff were cold and unhelpful. On the return leg that had a layover in Bangkok, they came thru the cabin without warning and sprayed everyone with some kind of disinfectant, that sent us into coughing fits. "
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"07 October,",,"First class LHR to Kuala Lumpur on the much vaunted 787. Service way below expectations.  I could not avail of the massage in their  lounge in Terminal 5. Tried to reserve this 3 weeks in advance but this was "" fully booked"". I was advised to get a walk in slot on the day but the only slot they had was too close to departure time. I only got  15 minutes on a massage chair . Check-in in their dedicated lounge was crowded and boarding chaotic and no sense of feeling like it was first class. Inflight cabin was ok but there was no sense of luxury. Cabin crew ok but not overly friendly and very very slow to anticipate passengers' needs. This despite having 3 cabin crew looking after only 8 first class passengers. Only one toilet  and no different from toilets in a low cost carrier. Entertainment on board was diabolical. No Wifi.  Food very average. On arrival the stewardess could not be bothered to help when I asked about Fast track.  Return trip also very average. The best service was in the first class lounge in KLIA and that was a Malaysia Airlines lounge not BA. Service inferior compared to first class with Air France."
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"11 July,",,"I fly the 777-300ER four times a year, commuting back and from LHR to Rio. The airplanes seats are hard, uncomfortable ( for being a business class seat ).
The meal tastes horrid, and the salad was completely dried out and rotten.
Only good thing was that the beverages were free.
The inflight entertainment is ok ( a big upgrade from the old 777-200ER ).

The staff was mad, and they had places us all around in the plane...

The airplane became VERY hot during flight, I did not bother to ask the cabin crew to ask the pilots to turn the temperature down, because the cabin crew would respon saying it's illegal to talk with the pilots...

And of course not to mention, not a single european flight that won't be delayed!"
British Airways,10-Oct,ar,"25 February,",,British airways provided us with excellent service. The cabin crew and pilots were friendly and we had no problems.
British Airways,10-Oct,ar,"08 March,",,"British airways is very good, clean aircraft, seats comfy and friendly crew, not to mention the amazing entertainment screens."
British Airways,9-Oct,ar,"05 January,",,"I have flown BA many time, my most recent experience being London to Los Angeles.  We were made to feel very welcome, the seats a very comfortable, and the IFE was excellent with a good choice.  Food was comparable to other experiences and better than others we have flown on.  I would recommend BA to family & friends without hesitation.    "
British Airways,8-Oct,Rudi Brunnenmiller,"19 March,",,"We took a flight from Milano via London to Bangkok. The staff in Milano, ok. The lounge serves a nice breakfast in the morning. The flight to London uneventful. The lounges in London are good but too full. It is a problem to find a seat sometimes. We were on an 20 year old B777s from London to Bangkok round trip. The crew was superb on both legs. The legroom is ok and the service is good. The entertainment program is old fashion. The screens are old and the choice is very limited. But when compared to economy on other european carriers it was over average."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"03 November,",,"In May 2016 I booked a World Travellers Plus ticket from London to Johannesburg and return for my wife.
This was changed a few days later to return from Cape Town rather than Johannesburg and I was advised there would be an additional charge and I agreed that this charge should be taken from the Debit card, which I had paid the initial ticket for.
We checked the BA website and all the details were adjusted and marked as confirmed.
At the end of August 2016 I received an email asking me to contact BA, which I did.
I was asked if I had adjusted the return ticket from Johannesburg to Cape Town that I confirmed I did and I asked if there were any problem with the ticket as my wife was travelling on her own and the customer services agent confirmed everything was in order and I was not asked for an additional payment for the flight change.
I could not understand the purpose and raised the issue when I had another email from BA asking for experience with the BA Contact Centre.
I never received a reply.
On 22 September I booked the outgoing flight with out any difficulty and my wife checked in at Heathrow without being asked for any additional pay"
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"24 October,",,"   We took a Miami to London flight (209) two weeks ago, in Business class, on the way to Amsterdam. If you are tall, the seats are terrible. Check ""seat guru"". The pitch is 72 inches (6' 0"") and the width is 20"". So if you are 6' tall and you push your head against the top end, you will be able to lie flat. If you try to lie on your side with a seat width of 20 inches, you need to be a contortionist. Even if you are not tall, try lying sideways in these seats!
   Compare this to Iberia flights from Miami to Madrid (you can connect to Amsterdam from there also). The typical configuration is pitch 78"" and width 26"". Guess which one I am flying next time."
British Airways,2-Oct,Janet Benjian,"19 June,",,The most horrible airline ever.  Service and hospitality is very poor.  Flights get canceled all the time.  Our flight got canceled in Rome and they left the Passengers by themselves since British Airline does not exist in Rome. We had a nightmare on the way of home. Never ever book with this Airline since you will regret it.
British Airways,0 / 10,Sharon Siegel,"31 August,",,"BA has gone to the dogs. It used to be an airline of choice. Not now. In the last 12 weeks, 4 international return flights 3 have been disrupted, 3 cancelled or missed connections as a result of delays. The last of which involved 2 cancelled flights, resulting in a night in Gatwick on the way AND the way back. On the return cancellation after sitting on the tarmac for 3hrs, BA refused to facilitate hotel rooms and told the plane load of passengers that everyone was on their own, both in rebooking alternatives, and in finding accommodation. I have never been treated so badly, this at a time when the delay cost me the ability to see my mother before she died. Avoid at all costs if possible."
British Airways,3-Oct,ar,"24 July,",,"the last time i flew with ba will be my last time with them, i flew from bangkok to london several years ago in a 747 which appeared to be either new or recently fitted with new seats with video screens in the back,at the time i had only heard about such things and was looking forward to the flight until i shoehorned myself into the seat and realised i was in for an uncomfortable, to say the least,12 hours the legroom was like an average minibus and the seat reclined about as far as a transit van drivers seat,i managed to sleep for about 30 minutes max even though the flight left at 12.35 am and was tired as hell.the staff were useless and spent most of the time asleep. i could go on forever but their's not enough space...i now fly with any far eastern or middle eastern airline and the difference in service and comfort is immense,even on a lesser known carrier like oman they can't do enough for you and feature on board wi fi and mobile phone connection..  finally got that off my chest."
British Airways,2-Oct,Saeed Alzubaidi,"04 July,",,"My flight on British Airways BA0106 flight got delayed and then my connection got cancelled.

We contacted the BA call center multiple times to make changes to the flight. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight.
British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges.

The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calls to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. After multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded. The whole experience was terrible and damaging."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"22 February,",,"The rewards program is deceptive with very few available seats.  The website tends to be down 305 of the time I try to book a rewards flight.
I called customer service to see if they could book it and unfortunately their system was down as well.  They asked me to call back in an hour or two.  I called back in 45 minutes and the same customer service agent berated me for not waiting the hour that he had stated.  I replied so you know when it is coming back up?  He replied no I don't but wait another hour anyway"
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"07 November,",,"British Airways have very bad customer service. I flew with them early this year with my infant and i was told at the point of purchase of my baby's ticket that he was entitled to a 23kg bag,a stroller and a car seat. I however got to the airport and i was made to pay 200$ for my baby's bag or they wouldn't carry it. I tried to argue this based on what i was told by their customer service rep over the phone and they totally didn't hear me out. I had a lay over in Heathrow and still complained at the BA counter and i was told that i was only misinformed,that my baby ain't entitled to any bag. I was so mad! What kinda of misinformation is that. I would therefore not be flying this airline again and would try and deter anyone trying to fly with them as i see they are not reliable. What if i didnt have a spare 200$ to pay on my travel date, would my luggage have been trashed? "
British Airways,10-Oct,ar,"04 July,",,"Flew BA283 from LHR to LAX on Saturday, 13th June in economy, upstairs at the back of the plane, which was the A380.
We found this to be not only our best BA flight ever, but also our best on any airline.
The aircraft was new, clean and incredibly quiet. Being upstairs with a 2:4:2 configuration, in a window and aisle seat, we had more room than ever in economy. The locker beside the seat is really handy and adds to the room available and sense of space.
What sets this flight apart was the crew, who were all mature, kind, helpful and lovely people, who worked incredibly hard and made us feel special and valued customers, even though we were only travelling economy.
Over recent years I have had cause to complain to BA for poor service, but this flight went a very long way to restoring my faith in the airline."
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"16 December,",,"Connecting flight  did not wait for us to reach the gate, but took off without us, even though front desk was alerted that handicapped parties are on their way.  Had to wait another 4 hours for another flight.  Customer Service indicated they were unable to help. "
British Airways,9-Oct,ar,"05 January,",,Flew JNB to PLZ return on BA.  Both legs were great.  One of the nicest airlines in the South African domestic market
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"15 July,",,"Flew on a BA A320 from London to Rome. It was a fairly new plane, but still seemed a bit worn out. Our luggage was meant to be going straight from the plane we were on to this flight, but when we checked with BA to make sure our bags were on the plane, they ""had no record of the bags"".

Also went on a BA Embraer 190 from Zurich to London. The seats in this plane were more comfortable and seemed newer. "
British Airways,9-Oct,ar,"08 February,",,"I flew with BA from Heathrow to Madrid and Heathrow to Reykjavik return. On all occasions the service was good,  the pilots were very informative, cabin crew very obliging. I can see that BA is trying to improve their overall service. Each journey was comfortable. I will definitely fly with them again."
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"15 October,",,"I had the pleasure of flying in the Boeing787,a superb aircraft and flight.However the seat pitch in Economy is ridiculous for a twelve hour flight.When the passenger in front of me reclined his seat there was literally no space to manoeuvre.I am not overweight but I am 6ft-2ins tall and the point I am making is that most short haul flights would have been as ""comfortable"".I fly every six weeks and I was disappointed.All other aspects of the flight were good."
British Airways,9-Oct,ar,"28 December,",,"Flew Business Class from London to Hong Kong on one of BA's new A380's. Service was friendly and of a High standard as usual. The BA lounges in Heathrow are also very impressive.
Food served was very good, with a good selection. Alcohol selection also very good.
Flight ran to schedule.
My only slight negative is that I'm not a fan of the  Reverse Seat layout that BA seem to favour in Business Class, it is more cramped than Emirates Business class in the same aircraft.
But overall very impressed and would recommend."
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"31 December,",,"When travelling to the states, our first BA flight from Cork Airport to London Heathrow was delayed, meaning that we would miss our connecting flight to Baltimore. However, after going to the BA helpdesk, we were offered a later flight with Virgin Airways to Baltimore, free of charge, which was very helpful. Im so grateful for the help amd pur bags arrived on time in Baltimore too. Good experience overall."
British Airways,4-Oct,,"20 March,",,"Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit', is a saying attributed to Oscar Wilde. In this review of my recent experience on British Airways Club Class from Heathrow to Bangkok return, I am tempted to use those words to accurately describe events. First...the reason for my booking. It was in response to the folk who contacted me to ask why I had not included BA in a detailed comparison review I did, which compared the quality of Business Class cabins on five major airlines that flew the same route. They had a point. So, tickets booked, I arrived at LHR terminal 5 to check-in for my flight to Bangkok. Previously, I had made a request to BA's Public Relations department to conduct a short, informal interview with the day's Duty Manager. Such interviews requested of ALL the other airlines were granted, during which I gained much information. But...BA said, NO! However, at check-in, I asked if I could meet with the day's duty manager whilst in the lounge. 'No problem', I was told, 'we'll arrange it so please identify yourself at the Club Class lounge desk'. Did anyone arrive?...you've guessed it - NO. When querying the non arrival at that lounge desk, I was told that the meeting would take place in the departure hall. Did it? - NO. So, onto the aircraft, a 17 year old Boeing 777. One look around the cabin and my expectations fell . The layout of the 'lay flat' seats was such that passengers were forced to climb over each others legs to reach an aisle. It was at that point that my first thoughts of 'sarcasm and wit' came to mind. Were BA 'taking the Mickey' out of the business class passengers? I mused before a more hilarious thought hit me, Maybe Disney's Mickey had designed the seating arrangement and, tongue in cheek, presented it to Willie Walsh, who made the decision to implement it!!! Hmm, yes, my use of sarcasm...justified or not? Take off was 45 minutes behind schedule but that was to be expected...no big deal. Seat belt sign off...drinks offered and food items on the over exaggerated menu selected. OK I thought, I'll sip my preferred tipple and have a scroll through the on board entertainment system to choose what to view during the 12 plus hour flight. Well, that would have been so, if the screen unit would stay in one place...but it wouldn't...it was broken. Emergency DIY by one of the bearded cabin crew (all but one male was so adorned) as he forced a teaspoon between a gap in the framework. Voila, as the French would say, it held. Now the only problem was squinting to focus images on the tiny, outdated screen. At 30,000 feet or so, conversation was all but impossible if using one's normal voice as every cupboard door and fixture on the aircraft rattled continuously. At around that point, the cabin crew served the chosen meals. More sarcasm, I'm afraid. I'd ordered beef and beef it was. The stainless steel knives wouldn't work...'tough' doesn't describe the meat. Sawn into half-inch thick slices by a cobbler would have yielded soles for boots. Left on the plate, I 'passed' on a dessert and asked for Cheddar Cheese, crackers and a cup of coffee. It was easy to snap a piece off a cracker, but to do the same to the quarter inch thick slice of cheese came as a surprise...as was being served lukewarm coffee. No sarcasm or wit needed here â€“ just disappointment. Now...here comes another scene taken from a Fred Carno film script starring Charlie Chaplin. For a cabin crew member to serve food or drink to a passenger not seated at an aisle, he/she had to reach over the aisle passenger, then a plastic divider to present the tray/dish/item, meaning that person had to balance it before putting it onto their own sliding table. Good eh?...well done 'Mickey'. It was during this time, that I received unasked-for red wine...right into my lap! Oops! A rush to gather paper tissues and the impossible task of trying to mop-up the liquid. The passing of uncomfortable hours did eventually help my Chinos and shirt to dry but left behind the telltale tide marks edged in pink. The seat itself? The narrowest I've ever had to sit on and IN TWO SECTIONS! To rest ones feet, a separate piece of equipment had to be unlocked and risen to a chosen height. Then by the use of a row of hard to see buttons, the other half could be moved to finally make one piece. OK, well, putting that complicated lot together then raised the question, 'was it comfortable?' Maybe so if every passenger was less than six feet tall and as slender as a Vogue model. So the answer has to be NO. Sleep on was not possible (for me anyway) so I passed the time reading and playing Solitaire on my mini tablet...interrupted occasionally by glancing at the TV screen to monitor the aircraft's progress. The wheels finally touched down at Bangkok airport and we all disembarked. * En-route to the city hotel by taxi, I was wrangling with the events on the flight and now, in full daylight saw the results of the wine spill incident and reminded myself to email BA's UK office and inform them what had happened - and the cost of replacement. As of today (almost a month later) all I have received is an acknowledgement and an incident number. I'll wait a while longer before I trigger the sarcasm bit. Some days prior to my return flight I had a fall â€“ a bad one as I crashed onto a marble floor, my left hip bone taking the brunt. From that moment, I was in severe pain and could only walk a few paces with the aid of a walking stick. 'What was my 13 plus hour flight to the UK going to be like?' I kind of fretted. I emailed BA immediately to advise them of the incident, asking for special assistance at Bangkok airport, throughout the flight at Heathrow, where a car would be waiting to collect me. Guess what?...no reply, not even an acknowledgment. Anxious, I emailed again the next day...and the next day...still no reply. I was concerned, not knowing was worrying. Explaining to the hotel management, it too was concerned and made numerous telephone calls on my behalf to BA's Bangkok office....No response. Nevertheless, a taxi was arranged. The driver deposited me at the nearest drop off point to reach the BA check-in. Very kind and thoughtful. Surprise, surprise, when I limped to the Club Class desk, the Thai girl manning it immediately beckoned a wheelchair porter standing nearby and welcomed me with the words, â€œSawadee ka, Mister Fisher, I received the message about you from your hotel. Please, everything is arranged for you.â€ How nice eh? Luggage tagged, wheelchair occupied, I was pushed at a steady pace through immigration etc, where all the Thai staff were gracious and helpful, and onwards to the lounge which BA uses for its Club Class passengers. Relieved and relaxed I imbibed a whisky, ate a fresh salad and read a newspaper. At the arranged the porter appeared, helped me into the wheelchair and off we went to board the aircraft. Word had been sent ahead, as when having my boarding pass examined, the porter was given the authority to take me straight to the aircraft door. There, awaiting, was the BA Thai duty manager, a delightful girl with a charming smile. A few Bahts into the porter's hand prompted a wide smile and a genuine Wai and I was helped to my seat on row one. When seated, the Thai manager came to me and we began a conversation. It centred on the total lack of concern by BA's UK Customer Service. She was certainly deeply embarrassed that I had not been dealt with properly. I was the only passenger on board and I did notice the BA cabin crew glancing in our direction and talking among themselves. Boarding complete, the captain announced a timely departure and a probable earlier than scheduled arrival at Heathrow. At cruising altitude, the senior cabin crew supervisor came to me. It became clear that she now had been appraised of my problem by the Thai duty manager because she expressed her concern, asking me to call for assistance at any time during the flight. The flight. Same old 777, same rattles, uncomfortable seat, small, rickety entertainment screen, mediocre food, galley running out of the snacks clearly advertised as being available at the touch of a button. I found it impossible to lay without pain but that was not the fault of BA, but a softer, wider seat would have helped. Throughout this daytime flight, the cabin crew concerned did acknowledge each of my needs and were kind and careful. Heathrow at around 1730 hrs and the scramble to disembark began. I was beckoned to leave my seat as a wheelchair was ready and waiting so I did, and managed to get myself and my luggage to the aircraft's exit...BUT...no wheelchair...someone else had commandeered it. That left me in the middle of a scrum of passengers trying to get to the ramp first. I had no option but to limp up that quite long ramp, where at its end, stood an empty electric buggy. Fred Carno comes to mind again, as when three of us needing help gathered there and waited. Finally, a man of Asian origin arrived and he set off along the mile long passageway to the immigration desks. The buggy was allowed though a special gate and the immigration officer soon had us cleared to proceed to the baggage collection carousel. That was it - end of special assistance. We three were on our own, As our luggage came into view we helped each other load it onto our trolleys, said our goodbyes and hobbled away. That is my narrative as to flying British Airways club class. I've nothing but praise for those kind Thai people who ensured I received as much help as needed. BA staff and senior management however, only attract my disdain. Uncaring, dismissive, rude and snobbish. The CEO's office, refutes the appalling and negative reviews by passengers, stating that BA was flying more passengers than ever. My reply to that, Mr Cruz, is what Eric Morecambe would have said, 'RUGGISH'. The olympic games ranks medals - Gold, Silver and Bronze. My ranking for British Airways, is TIN."
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"14 August,",,Flew in the route Lisbon-London and everything was great!
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"06 August,",,"The seats were not that comfortable.  I flew business and had to pay to select a seat a few months out. Like paying for a business seat wasn't enough.  You can only select your seats 24 before the flight for free.  The lounge at Heaththrow is old and run down.  Food selection was bad.  The employees failed to announce my flight.  So I asked about it at 3:30 when I noticed something on the screens and was told they were already boarding ""I should hurry up)  of course you have to take the train to the terminal when I got there everyone was boarding.  Don't feel I got my moneys worth for flying business.  Also the movies from LA to London were the same ones shown on the return flight.  They should change the movies.  The food on the fight and the staff were good.  I could have done without the crying baby who managed to cry every 30 minutes for 10 hours.  Needless to say I did not sleep.  Also the air in the cabin kept going from hot to cold. "
British Airways,4-Oct,ar,"09 December,",,"Flew to Mumbai via LHR T5 on a 777. I would usually travel Business on this route but was shocked to see that BA wanted GBP 2K for an economy ticket, so economy it was. I did however pre-pay GBP 40 for Window seat selection at an emergency exit to get the extra leg room and window (I get nervous without a window). When I reached my seat, there was no window and my legs were impeded by the emergency door slide. When I asked to be moved to an actual window seat, which I had paid for, the steward refused saying the flight was totally full. He lied, there was open window seats in Plus and Business (I am a BA frequent flyer). Same story on the return sector. As a very experienced BA traveller, I can tell you that Business is not all it is cracked up to be. The food is NOT restaurant quality, it is about as good as economy only served on plates with drinks in glasses, the 'Champagne' is cheap and nasty; sleeper seats are claustrophobically narrow - don't sit in the isle as your elbow will take a hammering from the trolleys, and the staff love to pass your food tray through the privacy curtain. Best value is WT Plus, seats comfortable, food about the same. First, okay but very expensive. "
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"09 March,",,"BA is safe, and the a/c are well maintained. Bus class seats bizarre. Food is down to British standard. Cabin crew attitude to 'colonials' is very poor. When will the Brits realise they don't 'rule the waves' any more? Heathrow arrival is plain nasty, like they don't want you to come. So I won't any more. Much nicer people in Ireland, France and Italy, and you can get there on nice airlines like Aer Lingus and Cathay. Pity British Midlands was taken over by BA."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"14 March,",,"I travelled from JFK(New York)-Mumbai and back to New York. My overall experience was good but not the best. JFK to Mumbai journey was very good and travel time was very less compared to other airlines. However, while returning my layovers were in London and Manchester. Layover time was so less to transfer planes on a huge airport like London(LHR). So obviously I missed my plane from London to Manchester. I was running whole time during layover still couldn't catch the plane. Although BA providef direct plane from London to JFK. Food is average being Indian Vegetarian. In flight entertainment sucks except few good english movies. Staff was friendly and plane was clean."
British Airways,4-Oct,,"17 April,",,"Las Vegas to Heathrow case 17700704 , World Traveller Plus, 9 hour 30 minutes NO screen, hand control broken, foot rest broken, sun blind came out in my hand, very grubby, no wifi either way, aircraft 19 years old, 1 year left in service, paid extra to pick our seats Â£45 each way. They insulted me with Â£100 e-voucher off my next flight WITH THEM to be used within the next year. Got in touch which took 45 minutes on hold and they refused to give my Â£100 back in cash. I've paid 2018 prices for a 20 year old service."
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"16 June,",,"I am commenting about the onboard experience on BA domestic UK and short-haul EU flights where the onboard experience has been taken over by Marks & Spencer.

Yes, since e1, 2017, BA no longer has ANY customer service on these flights.  Rather, the flight attendants have become M&S surrogates trying to SELL you water for L1.20 rather than providing complementary drinks and a tiny bag of pretzels.  Now, you get exactly ZILCH complimentary.

Really, BA, have you no shame.  Has it become so clear to you that the customer be damned and all that is in it for you is money?  Nothing, nada, nichts. 

I am going to react by posting this comment and from now on, buying snacks and water at the airport and bringing it on board.  I will not be coerced into paying for the basic needs of air travel, namely, a glass of water and a pretzel, just because you see the need to line the pockets of the executives.

Hopefully, the blowback from this decision will be severe enough that BA will reconsider.  Time will tell."
British Airways,10-Oct,ar,"09 January,",,"I have flown this airline a number of times, and they are consistently high quality in many areas.  The number one thing is safety, takeoffs and landings were always well-controlled with no issues - ever.  While in flight overseas, occasional bumps would be dealt with through announcements, flight attendants checking to make sure passengers were wearing seat belts, which is not easy to do in Business or First Class.  On occasion, I was bumped up to First due to frequent flier status, unexpected but awesome.  Would recommend without hesitation.  "
British Airways,3-Oct,ar,"20 July,",,"Flew BA Premium Economy from Muscat to Heathrow. Old 777 aircraft in poor interior condition. No IFE working in mine nor my fellow passenger seat area. Cabin crew were great but don't have the resources to provide good customer service. Flew economy on the way back but delays caused due to broken ""baggage loader"" in Edinburgh and broken ""air bridge"" in Heathrow meant we didn't have sufficient time to use the airport lounge. Very poor food service on the flight to Muscat. Cabin crew informed me that ""they aren't supposed to give out snacks to economy passengers"" I am a Silver card holder and have just spent my Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£2400 on Qatar Airways business class Muscat-Edinburgh return. Good bye BA."
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"23 April,",,"We booked flights through British Airways from Manchester to Sydney and Melbourne to Manchester. Four of the six flights were with BA and the long-haul flights with BA were far better than those with Cathay Pacific (Hong Kong to Sydney) or Qantas (Melbourne to Hong Kong). The staff were very helpful on these flights and accommodated dietary requirements that were not pre bookable for economy passengers. The steward managed to get food from another section of the plane for me. The other airlines did not do this. The airline could do more to avoid foods that have high allergy occurrences, and vary the vegetables and fruit on offer. A list of ingredients would also be useful. The selection of TV and films was much improved on last year's range. "
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"01 April,",,"TLV-LHR-GIG, Good service, second time flying them, no complaints at all, crew on the Brazil bound flight very friendly but none spoke Portuguese which is a must on flights to Brazil, planes were 777's the first one old but the second one brand new and comfortable. My sole complaint would be about the AVOD system, they have new movies there but very limited selection, if they want to compete with the Gulf carriers they gotta step it up."
British Airways,10-Oct,Alan Miller,"22 May,",,"This is about the flight we didn't take, due to the C19 virus.
Three of us were booked in F-class from Santiago, Chile to Heathrow for June. As soon as BA gave me notice of cancellation I called for a refund. The kind lady answered on the second ring, took my information and said a full refund would be made within 2-3 weeks. The entire call took five minutes. Then, on the very next day, it was credited to my credit card. Talk about first-class service. We take this flight fairly often and, hoping BA returns to Chile look forward to doing so in the future. For me BA gets Five Stars."
British Airways,2-Oct,Shayan Lallani,"12 June,",,"British Airways cancelled our return flight and with less than 48 hours notice, and managed to lose our luggage (eventually found days later) on the return leg we did eventually take. These issues were ridiculous enough, but I believe British Airways still owes us compensation under the Canada Transportation Act, and the customer service experience they've provided in pursuing these claims has been another level of insulting.

I filed the above noted claims over 60 days ago and not received so much as a reply from their mysterious ""Customer Relations"" department, who Customs Service keeps telling me nobody can contact directly, not even Customer Service agents themselves. Time after time I've been told their timeframe for handling cases is 3 - 6 weeks, but we're well past that, with nary a care from the company. Customer Service keeps telling me they'll escalate it and I'll hear back from Customer Relations within 7 days or something to that effect. It's been ""escalates"" 3 times now, and I've not heard back. They claim that a manager will call me back within a day to discuss my complaint, and it never happens."
British Airways,7-Oct,,"10 November,",,This flight was a pleasant change from those I have experienced with British Airways in the last couple of years. On this flight service standards have lifted materially. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The quality of the food and beverages had similarly lifted. What had not changed was the standard and the (lack of) comfort of the seat. The Club Europe seat remains a standard economy seat with a blocked off middle seat. It is cramped and most uncomfortable and represents poor value for the significant premium paid. You get minimal benefit from travelling Club Europe.
British Airways,8-Oct,ar,"03 August,",,"Flew LHR to Bucharest today.
All went very well. On time, friendly staff, nice food."
British Airways,7-Oct,ar,"28 October,",,"I travelled lot of times ba in past I noticed :
1 . Dreamliner seats are comparatively smaller than previous models
2 . Media box in bottom of the economy seat is frustrating for long haul flights
3. Food is where BA has cut down aggressively , for breakfast earlier we used to get sandwiches with some other fillers ,now muffins or energy bar (are you kidding me !! )
4. Earlier tooth brush and paste was provided now they don't have it anymore
5. earplugs instead of headphones on a noisy flight ( earlier they used to give headphones )

Seems to me BA wants to enjoy more profits hence cutting down on services .

Will prefer Emirates or some other carriers "
British Airways,2-Oct,Jordan Lang,"08 September,",,"They are by far the WORST airline I have ever dealt with, even for value for money. And I have flown internationally on COUNTLESS airlines (including Turkish Airways, Emirates, Thai Airways, Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines, El Al, Qantas, Tiger, Jetstar, the list goes on and onâ€¦).  They have all been amazing.  Even the worse of these ones have been WAY better than British Airways.  Their customer service didn't honour a refund I was entitled to let alone try to offer me flight credit as a compromise.  They inadvertently told me to piss off.  You will highly regret even choosing to fly with British Airways."
British Airways,4-Oct,Rina Car,"31 May,",,"1.We arrived late to LHR,did not leave on time from DC.  We lost our flight in LHR to LIN at 7:20a and we were told to wait until 2pm and we got 10 pounds to spend. In Italy my family waited from 10 to 3pm and had to travel between airports LIN to MXP (68.1 km).  2.Lost luggage. We did not have luggage for our entire 7 days tours in Italy. I spent my tours vacation time exchanged several emails with the BA and the delivery company because the receiver address had a typo. 3.Finally, our return flight to DC was delayed almost 1 hour waiting seated the airplane just because the Capitan decided it was an emergency to wait for the family that needed to get their taxes refund to get their luggage from the airplane.
I filed a complaint after my trip and we got less of what we spend just in our flight (1),  evoucher for our luggages, $70 coupon and 50 euros on personal items for the 8 days-  our luggages were delivered 5 days after arrived."
British Airways,4-Oct,ar,"30 September,",,"Paid approx Â£1100 for a return LHR-LAS V/ 747-400. The trip felt like a memorial flight for the 90's. Uncomfortable seats, average food and service. Oxygen masks fell down during a fight between passengers three rows behind me, due to excessive amouns of alcohol served by the staff. All in all a great example of how not to operate an airline!"
British Airways,5-Oct,ar,"25 June,",,I was disappointed with this airline for 1 the cabin staff splashed hot water on my grandaughter and another passenger. The staff are not as friendly as other airlines eg: Qatar. I will not use you again. Thank you
British Airways,4-Oct,ar,"18 June,",,"I have flown with BA for decades and everything about the experience has been steadily declining.  Recently they have cynically used their customer history data about me to assign me my least favourite seat of choice, forcing me to pay for a seat that I used to be able to select as part of the price of my ticket. But worse than that, their punctuality has been consistently terrible. They somehow manage to run flight after flight that is late enough to ruin my trip home to see my kids or my working day, but just not quite late enough for compensation to kick in.
I'm done with BA. There comes a point at which you can only take so many insults heaped on your head with numbing regularity and a complete refusal to deal with complaints.
BA is the new Ryanair."
British Airways,6-Oct,ar,"09 July,",,"Return ticket from Heathrow to Bangkok (honeymoon) asked if we could upgrade to premium, told yes but an extra Â£220 each. This was no problem yet the ground staff stated there was no point on the 777 as very little difference. How wrong they were. The seating difference was more spacious and x2 rows instead of x3.

The 777 was old and held an atmosphere of early-mid 90's. I was staring dissapointingly at the A380's and more modern fleets of Emirates etc as we took off.

Seats uncomfortable, the wife suffered back pain there and back (excuse the pun).

Food was pretty good to be fair.

Wont be flying BA longhaul again, shorthaul not such an issue."
British Airways,4-Oct,ar,"27 August,",,"Absolutely disappointing experience. Flight was delayed by more than 2 hours but ground staff must unfriendly and unwilling to help arrange transport options even though plane touched down after midnight with no public transport options available. Reason was claimed to be weather but both Aberdeen and London experienced good weather, with no other flights being delayed in both locations. Concocted reason to fool passengers. Would not recommend this airline previous two flights have been delayed for at least an hour each."

British Airways,5-Oct,Tony Schumacher-Jones,"23 May,",,"A recent BA Flight, Business Class, as a second leg of a flight into the UK.

Whoever designed the business class configuration ought to be taken out and spoken severely too.  It is an abomination.  Our first leg was in QATAR Q Suites.  Imagine our shock when we sat down in BA business class only to find you are staring straight at your fellow passenger.  Whose idea was this?  It is appalling. Also, comfort level was - well can you give a minus score. Never go BA if you are a business class traveler."
British Airways,2-Oct,Margaret Sullivan,"01 April,",,"Avoid carrier if at all possible.

American Airlines changed our itinerary and gave us each 3 boarding passes with seat assignments. We tried to board the second flight and are told we didn't have tickets. American said they didn't have our tickets and British Airways closed three hours previously. I contacted BA. They claim no fault on their part."

Employees of the company British Airways free rebooked us for new flights, calmed us and helped to cope with the situation! I thank them very much! Would recommend!"
British Airways,3-Oct,Erika Greyling,"03 November,",,"Unbelievably Poor Service from British Airways

I recently travelled from Munich to London with British Airways, and it turned into an absolute nightmare. Our troubles began with their malfunctioning app. Despite checking in successfully, I was unable to retrieve our boarding passes.

Upon arrival at the airport, we discovered that there were no self-service kiosks, and the check-in desks were completely unattended. After seeking help from the information desk, we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us. Her dismissive attitude was infuriating, and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in, she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance.

After being put on hold for 25 minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldnâ€™t help us, we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue. By this point, our flight was delayed, and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes.

When I followed up with a complaint, British Airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next timeâ€”ignoring the fact that it was the app's failure that caused all these problems in the first place!

This experience cost us a staggering Â£682.43 in additional expenses, including new flights, hotel stays, taxi fares, and fines. Missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing.

British Airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology. If their app and website are going to fail, they must provide adequate support at the airport. I will never fly with them again, and I urge others to consider alternative airlines."
British Airways,9-Oct,,"08 May,",,"Flew Santiago to London Heathrow return. Both 14+ hour non-stops on a 787-9. I flew first class which was a cozy cabin of eight passengers/2-3 flt attendents. The outbound from Chile was perfect in every way. When I got to the airplane door, the flt attd insisted on carrying my carry-on to my seat. Only negative is minor, just that they improve on the traditional British meals. I'm half English but have moved on...lol Return from London wasn't quite as good, mainly due to an indifferent flight crew. The Concorde Lounge in T5 is really nice and since it was a late night flight I slept for about eight hours. All in all, a really great experience from check-in to arrival to leaving the airports. We're (3 of us) taking a family vacation next month and we'll fly the same route/flights. One way in first and the other in Club World. Maybe some day BA will enter the 21st Century and offer a modern business class experience. Listening, Willie?"

When I rang the so called Executive Club they agreed to change the ticket for the additional cost of the ticket with no extra charges. Whilst the online itinerary changed when I arrived at the airport I was told I didn't have a ticket. They told me my payment had not gone through but hadn't informed me. They insisted on charging all associated fees even though it was agreed that would not be the Case. i complained to Customer services who wouldn't remove the charges, gave me lots of platitudes of how wonderful their complaint system is and how seriously they take them but failed to explain their actions or do anything about it.

British Airways,3-Oct,ar,"27 August,",,"I have been flying with British Airways for several years now.  Before that I was flying SWISS Air.   The change was due to business in London.  I have witnessed a major decline is services on flight and more importantly on utilizing ""Avios"" (frequent mileage).  For the last 5 years I have been unable to utilize frequent mileage for anything, even upgrading.  I have at this point in time over 150 000 ""Avios"", and I cannot use them.  I just got off the phone with one of BA's representative (Amreen-D5), who was unable to give me ANY day in the summer of 2015 from April -August that I could purchase a Premium Economy Ticket and upgrade to Business with ""Avios"".  This is absolutely ridiculous.  For those of you that you may hope that you will join the club and be able to use your ""Avios"" with British Airways, GOOD LUCK!!!"

I recommended this Airline to two of my friends as the previous flight I had with British, (mind you some years earlier), had been most impressive.  However, on this occasion the flight to Singapore had staff who seemed totally disinterested and when we asked for a light snack, were shortly told there was nothing!  Our return journey back to Sydney provided us with more friendly staff however a glossed over apology was offered for the flight being 2 hours late.

British Airways,3-Oct,ar,"23 June,",,Booked a first class round trip flights from Orlando to Venice through Gatwick.  On way over bags were lost and not received for 5 days.  On return home bags lost again.  British Airways offered no compensation in foreign country other than buy what is NEEDED and submit receipts to get processed for return payment.  When you live where they lose your bags you are offered NOTHING and cannot go out and buy anything you may NEED as they do not compensate you at all.  Flight on way to Gatwick was so hot and flight crews response was that they could do nothing as it was set at 23 degrees centigrade and that is their temperature.  Food in first class should was disgusting to the point the tomato in a salad was rotten.  When you called baggage assistance from a foreign country you were on hold for 30 minutes waiting for someone to answer if they did.  If this is what you get for first class I am not sure what you would get in coach but this is an airline that should be avoided!

British Airways,6-Oct,,"19 December,",,"Very bad service with delayed luggage. For some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone else's name and to a different destination. I was flying from london to montreal and my suitcase was sent to Dublin. First guy I talked on the phone, after a week of no news at all, he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken... Were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something??... In theory, he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to montreal. But after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing, I decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase, was still in Dublin. A second email, was sent to get my suitcase send it to me. A couple of days after and of course, with no news at all from them, I decided to call them back again. This time my suitcase wasn't in dublin, it was sent to london heathrow and they lost it again at that airport... Great!! This guy, asked me to call them back, monday morning , london time, so I did. I called back again on monday morning, and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his london team, he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase, when I had done that same day I placed the delayed luggage report. Don't they have all this info in file?. After telling him that I did that, first day, he then asked me to call them back in 48h again... I'm tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase. No compensation was mentioned to me, even that I had to buy clothes and some other items that I already had in my suitcase. Lucky enough, this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip, otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable. I understand, there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but that's no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get what's yours. I think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time, I would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me. After this awful experience with their missing luggage department, I hardly doubt I will use british airways again."

British Airways,4-Oct,ar,"16 May,",,"777 flight from Mexico to Gatwick. Paid for 3 club class seats, on arrival in the 777 we were struck by the smell of vomit. We brought this to the attention of the cabin staff, who called cleaners back on but they were unable to deal with it. Over the next 9 hours we were treated to various sprays and covering with blankets over the floor, which did nothing to alleviate the problem. We were unable to eat or drink properly as we were all feeling unwell due to the smell. We were offered a single seat compensation by the stewardess circa Ã‚Â£400 e-voucher, which I thought was appalling considering I had paid for 3 club class seats all of which were affected but was informed this was the maximum they are allowed to offer in flight. On return I took up the matter with BA customer services, who have since lowered the offer to Ã‚Â£300 e-voucher. It has also taken them weeks to come back to me via e-mail. BA customer service is poor, there does not seem to be any real offer of compensation or any standard or understanding of common policy. Why were we offered more by the cabin staff? Probably because they could see and smell the situation first hand and realised how appalling the situation really was, whilst those who sit and are removed from the front line have no grasp of the damage they do to the business as a whole by adopting their don't care attitude. Needless to say, BA have lost a loyal long term customer to other airlines - such is the state of British management who are content to ruin their own business."

Filling out the form took almost as long as the 10 min disinterested massage Boarding â€“ slightly disorganised at gate with everyone cramming to get through doors and down to plane Onboard â€“ staff were excellent, very welcoming and attentive Food and drink â€“ no shortage of either. Whilst dine when you want is advertised it was not really offered and from what I could make out everyone ate at the same time Seat â€“ comfortable and bed was very good unless I would imagine you are on the large size. Turn down was a nice touch but others did miss out on their size pjâ€™s because they ran out In flight entertainment â€“ awful (think betamax rather than blueray). Very limited number of very average films available Arrival â€“ allowed off the plane first and then a long walk to immigration. Denver immigration was very quick and efficient as was luggage collection. Looking back though the queue was getting longer as the rest of the plane arrived. Get off and walk quickly! Return Check in â€“ excellent and very friendly (T3 could learn a lot!) Security â€“ premium passengers can skirt round a lot of the queue but then join the masses the closer you get to the machines Lounge â€“ very average with first and business all in together. Got a seat at the bar where the service was good Boarding â€“ quick and efficient and First were allowed to board first Onboard â€“ again staff were excellent (3 crew for 8 passengers was great) Food and drink â€“ similar to way out with plenty of food and drink Arrival â€“ T3 immigration was quick and efficient as was bag collection All in all BA First is an experience but at times it moved from first class to average class. First class should be first in everything not some. If I had been paying cash I would have been disappointed."
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"23 July,",,"Stuck in Houston Hobby Airport and I am trying to get home asap.  My mother fell and broke her hip.  Southwest will not help.  They want 301.00 to get an earlier flight. I came to the airport early to try to get a earlier flight,  now stuck here in the only restaurant until 7:50 PM.  This airline has no heart. "
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"11 January,",,Love SW they don't mess around with an hour to board the attitude is get on let's go get off..Perfect!
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"15 December,",,"For everyday people traveling for vacation or personal reason, this is the top airline.  They are affordable, friendly, and comfortable.  No first or business class.  Just a flight on a nice, updated, clean aircraft.  My average flight is about 1-3 hours, but I would fly with Southwest on an international flight.  If you are looking First Class and Business Class they aren't the airline, but if you can make do with WIFI and your own forms of entertainment they are the best airline.  No matter what the reason for my travel, I will choose SW if they offer travel to my destination."
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"26 June,",,"I am a rapid rewards member and called in with issues to my reservation. I usually only fly southwest but after my conversation with one of the Supervisors ""Laqueda"" she has made it very clear my business does not matter. She went in to say it is all my fault and was completely condescending as she was saying it and never even apologized for the issues I was having. I have always paid a little more to fly southwest but because of how they handle they're customers, I would stay far away from this airline. "
Southwest Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"03 November,",,"Southwest is having increasingly more difficulty being on time. And they are not putting in the same effort to fix their on going tardiness. I am switching to another airline for primary business travel as I simply cannot continue to be late for meetings. If more of us take our business elsewhere Southwest will be cured of their cavalier attitude.
EDITORS COMMENT: Good idea!"
Southwest Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"20 October,",,The flight attendants were passive aggressive. Horrible experience.  The seat saving thing should be addressed.
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"01 November,",,"I always had flights delayed.  I don't like that.  They blame it always on something else other than their incompetence.  I would rather fly Delta.   They have more flights,  more reliable and nicer customer service."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,,"10 November,",,"People complain about some silly stuff. To the lady complaining about flying with kids and not being able to sit with them - Southwest offers family boarding between Groups A and B, which leaves plenty of seats together to sit. We have also never had a problem with asking a flight attendant to assist, and they ask everyone seated to change seats to offer a family seats together; itâ€™s too easy. Southwest has been great for me. I have a slight fear of flying, so it makes me feel a lot better knowing that Southwest has more strict standards for hiring pilots, and in their 40+ years of flying, they have 0 fatalities. It is also super amazing that they offer 2 free checked bags, unlike all the other major airlines, AND they donâ€™t charge you any fees for cancelling flights, or changing flights. Now, yes, if you cancel, you donâ€™t get refunded, but your money goes into your account to use towards your next purchase... but thatâ€™s still awesome. Despite my fear of flying, I do still fly 6-10 times a year, and if Southwest flies there, I choose them 10 times out of 10."
Southwest Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"22 August,",,"Overall good experience with staff and crew at Southwest.  They helped us take our elderly and sick father on one last vacation.  Coming home we got delayed flying into Baltimore and the baggage desk there was TERRIBLE.   They were incredibly slow, Kept us waiting without explanation and Tiana was downright hostile to us about our luggage.  Angry people shouldn't be working in customer service areas.  Shame on you Southwest!"
Southwest Airlines,0 / 10,ar,"04 February,",,"I booked a flight in May 2015 for June. I was told I could not use my 'travel funds' from a cancelled trip they because expired on June 3 (1 year from the purchase date for a flight in 9/2014). So if I purchase tickets prior to June 3 it should be fine right? NO! I have to travel by June 3, which was not possible for us & stupid since the original dates booked were in September. I tried to gift the funds but that didn't work either, ONLY the funds in my name could be applied to my trip. So basically there was no way to utilize the travel funds at this point and customer service was HORRIBLE. I contacted them via them the 1-800 number and was told I need to call Customer Relations. I tried multiple times to times to contact them (>20 calls) only to get a busy signal for 2 days. When they finally answered after a 15 minute hold for a 'expired travel funds' line, I was told (by a manager) June 3 was a 'hard date' and there was nothing she could do, or for transferring travel funds (both based on a policy by a Federal Dept....). The time I want to travel is 3 weeks after 6/3. It's nonsense they can't find any resolution, and lost a customer, credit line, and purchase/$$$ because of it!"
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"16 August,",,I have been flying Southwest Airlines for the last 3 years. I have a neurological condition which requires me to use a wheelchair at the airport. I told them and they pre boarded me and my daughter. They also have excellent customer service. Clean airplanes . Great fares. I would not change it.
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"10 January,",,I have flown Southwest for last 3 years. 79 times last year. Good value for what you get. 
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"29 October,",,"Haven't been on SW in a number of years as I live overseas.  My flights were BUR to OAK to BOI and return.  All four flights pushed back and arrived early.  I paid the extra $25 for auto check-in which got me in the first 35-40 to board.  The usual friendly and professional service from all ground and flight staff.  It's better than ever in my opinion and this from someone who used to fly 50+ flight segments a year on Southwest.   Still the best....
EDITORS COMMENT: Great to hear such positive feedback."
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"08 February,",,"Great experience aboard southwest flight 323 from fll to aus..first off I fly southwest alot and cannot complain about any  prior Flights..but this flight was the best by far..2 main reasons flight attendants Pierce,hae young Wagner.and usry,Jane..after a week in the Caribbean and about to face reality again,the last thing I wanted was to  sit on a crowded plane for 3 hours.. we flew on Superbowl SundayAnd thought if we got some score updates we wud be happy.. the only device my friend and I had were our cell phones..but to our surprise Mrs.usry pulled out her lrg iPad and said u guys can watch the game on a bigger screen..my friend & I again want to says thx Mrs.usry u made a 3 hr flight feel like 30 mins..and last but not least ms.Pierce,hae young.. you topped off a great flight with your  great sense of humor  that kept us laughing and smiling while being professional at the same time..with 30 yrs with southwest I hope the airline  realizes what they have in you under their wing.. my friend and I hope that we come across you both someday in a future flight until then fly safe be happy and enjoy life..."
Southwest Airlines,0 / 10,Paul Hix,"17 December,",,"My fiance and I got an offer to fly private to NYC but still needed our return flight back o Texas. So we ""no-showed"" because we only had an option to cancel both flights and not just the 1st flight. So they then cancelled our return flight as well and kept $1,200. They were then semi-rude on the phone. This policy is a joke and I have done this 2 other times for a past United flight and they did not do this. No wonder Southwest stock is half as much as United stock. Terrible &amp; greedy company."
Southwest Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"27 December,",,"Southwest and love field handled the bad weather on December 26th very very poorly, in over 30 years of business travel this was the worst I have ever seen.  Bad weather happens, its how its handled that counts."
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"02 January,",,"Southwest Airlines is the most family friendly airline. I appreciate the separate family boarding that gave myself and my husband time to settle our daughter in. The flight attendents on my family's flight from DCA to Austin (and back) were kind and considerate. Overall, I felt the entire crew were understanding  of how nerve racking getting on a flight with a toddler can be. Thank you, Southwest! See you on our next flight!"
Southwest Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"14 December,",,"Stay away from Southwest Airlines!
I own & run a travel agency and we work with several airlines world wide. I am sorry to say, but we never have we experienced such bad service as we have from Southwest.
I booked a flight to fly on Dec 2nd from San Diego to Seattle, and return on Sept 5th. Unfortunately I had to postpone my departure one day. Since I had purchased a low price ticket I bought a new one-way ticket for Dec 3rd from SW, and was planning to use the return flight which I originally purchased, which is normal for most airlines. As expected, I received a cancellation notice from SW since I did not show up from my original departure on Dec 2nd. But here comes the shocker, SW cancelled also my return flight, which I was planning to use. Even if I also had booked a new departure with them, so I had a round trip flight. So, I called their customer service to have them fix it, and got NO help. I was told the money and flight is lost since I did not show up for my original departure. Not satisfied with this response, I also sent a complaint by mail to SW to give them a chance to redeem themselves. Got the same answer, the flight & the money is lost.
EDITORS COMMENT: Most airlines we come in contact with cancel the whole ticket so we are not surprised with what Southwest did. We don't agree with this practice though and would like to see it stopped. "
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"25 April,",,"We were like cattle being driven onto the plane.  We were packed into such small spaces that the rats could never get off the ship in case of emergency.   We left from Boston and arrived in St Louis, MO.
When I called SWA to ask about choosing seats, I was told that travelers board together and will sit together.  Early Bird Boarding was never mentioned.  Without Early Bird Boarding you are last to board and stand absolutely no chance of sitting with your companion, nor of finding a place for your carry-on anywhere near your seat.
I WILL NEVER FLY ON SWA AGAIN. I'D GLADLY PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLAR MORE TO AVOID SOUTHWEST AIRLINES."
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"07 April,",,They have lost all customer service. Rude staff across all departments.  Beware and good luck if you fly Southwest anymore.  You might have your vacation unexpectedly cancelled like ours.  And they don't care what happens to you anymore.  They've forgotten that their customers are real people.
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"18 July,",,"Southwest is a great low cost airline, their WannaGetAway fares are hard to beat. I myself, like their boarding system. Sit where you want if you are in Group A or even B. They allow the largest carry on bag size along with one other airline. No fee ticket change, two free checked luggage and have one year to use a ticket if you cancel flight. I don't need frills or perks on domestic flights under 4 hours. The idea to fly is to get from one place to another and Southwest does a great job. To their BOSS, get some seats that are more comfortable."
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"25 July,",,"I fly southwest at least once a year. Only airline I don't get anxiety on.Almost every time I fly with them it's a smooth flight. The customer service is always on point. The gate agents , flight attendants , and pilots all have a sense of humor. NO baggage fees, everyone is treated equally. Free drinks (non- alcoholic) and snacks (peanuts and pretzels ). Your flight will 99.9 percent of the time arrive early unless your flight is delayed, but even at times we still arrived on time if not few minutes after original schedule. With that being said if you want to save money & have an enjoyable flight southwest is your airline ! "
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"06 May,",,"Always fly to/from New Orleans to Orlando and always enjoy the flight. Depending on the flight crew, 90% of the times they are happy and make the flight enjoyable. Seats could be a little more comfortable. Happy they do not charge for check in luggage. "
Southwest Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"08 July,",,"For anyone flying with children over the age of 5, DON'T FLY SOUTHWEST. It's open seating so if there are no seats together by the time you board, your kid's sitting by themselves. The answer I got when I called was, that's the way it is, that's the way it's always been, and you have to pay extra if you want to board first to ensure you can sit with your child."
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"29 May,",,"To Whom IT May Concern:
Thank you for giving me a free Leinenhugel Summer Shandy, when asked to pay with my SW credit card, she said she would be back but never asked again.  That was very nice, possibly it was an oversight but I doubt it due to the need to keep stock records.  Best Regards - It was confirmation 413XLB on Sunday May 28th from Tampa to Raleigh Durham.  Much appreciated.  Sincerely, Patricia Waitkevich"
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,David Serna,"27 July,",,"Does well for low cost flight but lacks one attribute - customer conciliation for non-delivery.  I frequently took flights St Louis to San Antonio for 1 yr, due to change in work I cancelled last flight.  Funds are relocated to Travel funds which expire in one year - thats it ""nada, zero, not even a thank you"". Southwest you can at least give me some points for future use!
Also, the seats are getting tighter and not so comfortable at all."
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,,"13 November,",,"On 11/09/17 Iï¸ traveled from St. Louis to Raleigh, North Carolina with my mother. Southwest rocked it from beginning to end! Baggage check in outside was so easy and the guys were so helpful! The ladies in screening were so nice and helpful to my mother who had to go to a separate area. When Iï¸ finished in screening the screener was holding her hand and walked her over to me! Thanks ladies! The lady at boarding also allowed us to board early because of moms disability! You made it an easy experience for someone that was a bit nervous traveling with my mother. Thank you so much."
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"06 October,",,"I flew Los Angeles to Las Vegas return, The fares were cheap, the flights were full, experienced their flight attendants sense of humor and was served a drink on each sector. Would I fly with them again - yes  "
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"16 May,",,"Beware to those of you who think you are ""loyal"" Southwest fliers! Take it from the lady who flew SW for years & recently got burned by them. They pride themselves on their customer service, but let me tell you it is a front. I booked a flight with my 18,000 points (yes that's right POINTS because I WAS a LOYAL customer) & I went through the entire process per usual. I happen to log onto my SW account yesterday (2 months after I booked my flight) & noticed my points said zero when last time I looked I still had some points. When I called, they decided to inform me that a system error occurred & they allowed me to book an upcoming flight with points that would expire before the flight & there's nothing they can do about it even though it's THEIR system error and now I am out 20,000+ points. They went on to blame me for not knowing the expiration date and not knowing that you can't book flights with expired points (never did I receive an email or ANYTHING informing me of this). Their point system/customer service is a hoax. They continued to tell me theyre working to get this problem fixed but they would offer me the same fare price as when I booked it. Guess what it's the same price"
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"12 November,",,"Cabin crew were on the ball,no extra charges for food, bags etc, what you pay is the final amount.
Yes you cannot reserve a seat, but they tell you that so dont complain if you have to split up.
Seats were wider than most discount airlines, leather & comfortably padded unlike some full service airlines with the new style slim seats(slim padding)
Crew were funny & made a short 1 hour flight fun."
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"25 May,",,"Best airline out there.  After having bad experiences with Allegiant, Spirit, and American, I decided to pay a bit extra to go with Southwest.  After realizing it, it actually saved me money.  2 checked bags and 1 carry on included in the price!  Plus, the nicest staff on planes and I have never had a Southwest flight delayed.  Also, their customer service and booking agents are very knowledgeable and know what they are talking about, unlike the other above mentioned airlines.  "
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,Jill Skowron-Gontkovic,"24 April,",,I have had so many bad experiences with other airlines.  Southwest is family and military-friendly.  Their baggage policy is unmatched.  Their pilots always come out and say hello to my kids while we are boarding and/or getting off the plane.  The free movies and shows have saved me on long flights with 4 kids. Check-in is so easy.  Everyone I have come in contact with who works there has been so kind and helpful.  I had to contact customer service twice and they were so helpful and fixed my situation right away.  We will always fly Southwest whenever possible!
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"24 January,",,"Ok, been flying multiple airlines and I ALWAYS check Southwest Airlines first.    East of boarding, changing tickets, and use of refundable points/dollars when I reschedule has been phenomenal.    I sometimes have to fly other airlines, especially if Southwest does not offer a direct flight there but I usually have to medicate when I do.   I have never met friendlier staff either.    I wish they flew intercontinental.   "
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,,"10 January,",,"For all of you that have submitted poor reviews for this airline, ""boo-hoo"". Sorry you feel the way you do, BUT, I must disagree with you all. I have flown with Southwest Airlines over the years, whether I was flying to Las Vegas, San Diego, or Tucson. I have never had a bad experience with them. The only negative thing I would say is that they do not have the best ""leg room"". But with 2 bags checked in for FREE; and 1 carryon at no cost, that is pretty darn GOOD, considering that the ""other"" guys charge you for ever 1 bag checked in. And their fares are lower too."
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"02 March,",,I would recommend Southwest Airlines and here is why.  They a real no frills airline because first 2 bags and your carry-on fly free and they don't charge for soft drinks and if you use wifi on the plane it' s 5 bucks and the crew is friendly.
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,,"10 April,",,"Southwest Airlines is awesome. Never fly American Airline's when you have Southwest. Their flight attendants are the nicest people ever, they have great services, and the flights are very cheap."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"12 January,",,"I have flown Southwest for years.  I will always choose them, over other carriers if price is close.  "
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,Frederick Aronson,"10 June,",,"This once great airline has swiftly declined into mediocrity during the COVID crisis evidently.  Great customer service and public relations is horrible.  Wait times for phone calls are 60-90 minutes, the CSRs are rude and uncaring, and the early check in is a scam.  I purchased an early check in, 36 hours rather than 24 hours, to ensure a better chance of a seat at the front of the plane. instead, you cannot verify it even occurred, and cannot see any validation until the 24 hour window.  I am a long time and loyal flyer of Southwest, but no more!"
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"07 July,",,"I've flown Southwest from my Midwestern abode to both east and west coasts in the last year. I'm always amazed at how courteous most of the gate agents are. I only had one with a slight attitude which is pretty darn good given the stress of the job. Seat room is decent; not the most comfortable perch ever but it works for a few hours. Free snacks and drinks are very nice too. Once you figure out the boarding process you can usually get a decent seat. Overall, it's a good value and I enjoy flying with Southwest. "
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"07 January,",,"Traveled on Dec 25th. Flight was full, customer service was great, flight staff was nice and friendly. "
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"10 April,",,"I made flight reservations 6/6/14 for my daughter and I for 11/27/14 from. Due to a family emergency, I had to cancel the flight and request a travel credit in the original amount of $586 in 09/14. When I spoke to the Southwest Airlines Customer Service rep to ask what my options were for reusing the travel credit I was told that as long as I made my flight reservations before 6/6/15, I could reuse the travel credit. I asked if the new flight would have to be scheduled before 6/6/15, and she said no, as long as I made my reservation before 6/6/15 I could apply the travel credit to the new flight since I have to pay for the flights at the time of reservation. I'm now trying to book new flights on 6/16/15 and Southwest Airlines is refusing to accept my travel credit of $586 towards the new flights since they expire on 6/6/15. This is exactly the opposite of what I was told by their Customer Service rep in September when I asked about cancelling the original flight. I've now lost $586 dollars. I feel like I've been robbed by Southwest Airlines."
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"22 August,",,"Always have a great experience when flying with Southwest. The entire crew are very professional and accommodating. This is my very first choice when flying domestic, or to their island destinations. Keep up the great work!"
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"03 September,",,"Got to say I have not traveled with any other airlines than Southwest. Their rates are amazing cheap and the service is great! I usually fly from LAX to LAS a couple times a year and its been amazing everytime. Last trip I had to make a last minute purcahse to from back from LAS to LAX and I sat right in the front (open space) and due to being a late night flight and being with my fiance, I asked the staff member for a shot of Jack Daniels and he brought them with small heart straws and watched we got everything we needed before we landed in Los Angeles. "
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"22 September,",,"I've flown southwest from mke to las twice. Then, I also flew from mke to sac. Flight was reasonably priced for the trips and staffs were GREAT! I had a few hour delays here and there but not too bad. They offer great service onboard and gave free drinks. "
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,kona Johnson,"29 April,",,"Sadly, Southwest practices are unethical and I won't be flying with this airline again. The day I booked, I specifically shopped for a nonstop flight on various airlines. I could have booked a connecting flight for much less. However, we are traveling to my daughter's wedding with many bags of decorations, wedding clothes, etc., and we also wanted to avoid rechecking bags at a connection for an international flight, so we chose to pay more for a nonstop. Now that Southwest is losing money for grounding the Max 8, they changed our flight to a connecting flight without any compensation and refusing to change our flight to a nonstop out of a different airport. We are losing the money we could have had if we had bought a connecting fare in the first place and if take the option of canceling, we lose money on the fare increase since booking. So Southwest wins this round. But we will not be flying Southwest again due to this bait and switch unethical way of doing business."
Southwest Airlines,3-Oct,Sheldon Kamieniecki,"10 April,",,"Due to the terrible storms that recently took place in Dallas, Texas, I was unable to travel to California for two days. The flights the following days, of course, were full, and I had to cancel my trip. I was traveling on American Airlines to California first, and then Southwest from Burbank to San Jose Airport. Because I could not get to California in time to catch my Southwest Flight, I had to cancel it. It was canceled two days before I was to leave. I then received an email at the time the flight was supposed to take off in Burbank that said I had not canceled the flight and that I would lose all my money because I had not canceled it before the time of the departure. The huge storms in Dallas was not my fault, and Southwest should have at least credited my account for a future flight. They refused to do this. I won't be flying them anymore. There service has become increasingly worse during recent years, and there pricing policies (e.g., the business seats scam we all know about) are byzantine. Time for them to go under and disappear for all our sakes."
Southwest Airlines,0 / 10,Jackie Dunbar,"04 March,",,"Very worst I have ever been treated was on Southwest in BWI It was between flights, I needed a wheelchair It was not available we were late to the gate the agent was extremely rude. I was in loading bridge I made a comment to my husband â€œ why does she have to be so
bâ€”â€”â€”hy â€œ , she heard the comment and forbid me to fly on the flight. I do not feel that my comment would somehow put anyone in danger. The agent did not like my comment she decided to use her power to punish me. I will NEVER forget this as long as I live. This was caused by her using the power of the FAA giving airline employees the right to treat passengers any way they want. I try to avoid flying on them the employees have become increasingly rude on the ground. The flight attendants are not as bad but Southwest was always suppose to be the â€œfun airlineâ€. This could not be further from the truth. It would be so nice to have a seat assignment."
Southwest Airlines,4-Oct,ar,"22 February,",,"I fly Southwest several times a year. I love them and I hate them all in the same flight. They are not the cheapest flight anymore. But they are far and away the best freguant flyer program. I hate lining up before boarding. I love that i can change a flight without a charge, every a rewards flight. I hate that I can not upgrade, anything. I hate ho entertanment or real food on board. I hate the seats, I hate the only place to get a flight is thier webb site, no expedia or such. Come to think of it, I hate a lot more than I love, but I do love there rewards program. "
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"06 December,",,"The staff for my flight was exceptionally helpful and patient with my family.  I was travelling with my wife and 4 children; the oldest children were barely 2 years old (2 sets of twins).   We had a flight with 3 stops between El Paso, TX and Raleigh, NC, the staff did everything they could to help us manage the trip.  During each stop they went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed and helped entertain the children all while ensuring the flight kept its schedule.  While the children did have moments of discomfort with the pressure in their ears, I must say they acted wonderfully throughout the course of the entire trip.  I must give credit to the flight staff; this is in no small part due to their efforts and understanding."
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,John Miner,"30 March,",,I understand hiring diversity but the key employees need to have a better attitude. Started with the SMart Mouth Denise in Chicago at the self baggage check in threatening us that she will make sure we miss our flight because she has a chip on her shoulder and a 11yr old is having issues with the self bagging sticker.. what and A-hole she was. Then the wifi on the plane to LAS was out on the plane. Then the flight home Traveling home with the kids we had turbulence so we didn't have the normal time to prepare to land the FA goes lets hurry up move chair up and slide your bag under seat further. I said I have to kids and I can only do so many commands at once and the Ass FA said Im just gonna stand here cause this is my job .. I said Good glad to see you doing your job. I saw all the other FA's working and only seen you at the end.  I worked at Midway Airlines for 10 years. Southwest is going down hill now that Herb has passed. Attitudes need adjusted.
Southwest Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"12 May,",,"As if the indignation of partial self-serve ticketing weren't enough Southwest continues its joke of service with no reserve seating,  a cattle-call style boarding, no meal flights and two of two late flights. While air flight has become lost unpalatable in recent years Southwest made me consider never flying again. What a joke."
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"07 June,",,"Cannot complain about pricing or baggage. Very affordable and easy to understand about protocols, as this was my first flight ever. Seats could be more spacious, but nothing that would hinder me from flying this airline again"
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"07 January,",,"I always fly Southwest when i can.  most recent trip Cle-Msp.  Their friendly, they care the service is great!  I had an issue with intermeittant Internet on one leg and they promptly refunded the money.  Wish they had none stops to LAX, they never would have to fly United."
Southwest Airlines,7-Oct,Marlene Andreoli,"09 March,",,"On our last trip with SW. our luggage arrived at our destination open and with half the items in the luggage missing. I have submitted a claim but no resolution yet. On our way back home our luggage was damaged. They gave me a credit for another flight with this company. A week later my husband received an alert on his credit report of a collector negative charge from this agency. We have never received a bill, call nothing to indicate we are in debt. But our credit report reflects a collection. I would stay clear from this company. Only headaches to come with them."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"09 July,",,"I have flown on Southwest many times throughout the U.S.  They are a simple low-cost carrier with no frills.  The best thing about them is that your first checked bag is free and they take-off and land on time.  Also, they have an excellent safety record."
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,Matt Hoch,"20 January,",,"Low cost, fast gate to gate without delays.  So if you're flying less than 2 hours FLY SOUTHWEST.  It will cut your gate to gate time versus United by over an hour.  They don't waste time, but it's a poor customer experience.  Time is worth it for me on the short haul but could not take a 3+ hour flight with them."
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,,"26 December,",,"Southwest Airlines denied my young children from boarding a plane 12 minutes before departure. They were re-booked on another flight which gave them a long layover that was not planned. I called customer service and asked if they could be compensated with meal vouchers because my hungry children, ages 9, 9, and 4 would need to eat. They refused because they claimed my family was late for the flight. They arrived at the airport at 2:30am for a 5:00am flight and were detained in security because my 9 year old daughter packed her rock collection. They arrived at the gate at 4:53am for a flight that left at 5:05am. Southwest's policy is to close the gate 10 minutes before departure, which means they should have been allowed to board. I asked to speak to a manager and was told managers do not take phone calls, but I was welcome to speak to a coordinator. The coordinator refused to offer any compensation and blamed my family for being late for the flight. Then she, her name was Dawn, hung up on me. Totally unreasonable. Zero customer service. No compassion for travelers. Never, ever fly this airline."
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"03 April,",,"Worst experience travelling ever! Our plain was to depart at 2:30 they sent us an alert at 9:45 that it was delayed till 4:30, then again at 11:30 that it was now delayed till 5:30, lastly we were sent at 2:10 our 2:30 flight was on schedule. We obviously missed that flight and called a representative to complain and figure what we needed to do. They told us we could take their 3:45 departure and there was space available on that flight.

When we were checking our bags in, there were only 2 Southwest employees working which made it take an hour to move 20 people. Once we get to the rep there he told us the 3:45 flight was full and he doesn't know why they would have told us that. We  where now stuck waiting for the next flight which wasn't until 7.

Southwest will be a NO FLY for all of my family and friends from now on."
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"07 October,",,"The people complaining about southwest probably don't have that much expensive with the airline industry. I have flown a lot. Every time I fly, I try to get southwest. The baggage system is so good. The flight attendants are nice or seem to be. And you pick where you sit that is nice. There is no charge to sit where ever you want. And it feels good to know southwest has never crashed a plane and less than 10 have died flying with southwest. But it feels like a bus with wings. Over the best airline in the US but I wish they would fly to Hawaii."
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"03 October,",,"When traveling this past week with my 2 year old, I needed to bring my  stroller in order to have transportation for her at our layover and our destination. Not only did Southwest ""misplace"" my stroller for several days  but upon delivery where I was staying in Rochester, NY it arrived damaged and missing parts. The sun shade was torn, there was a slice through the foam that pads the arm handle, something occurred that makes it difficult to now fold up and two cup holders were completely missing. When I reported it to the man that delivered it, he said he could do nothing. Therefore I went to baggage claim on September 28th at Rochester Airport to report the incident and they said they would do NOTHING for the damages and I should have signed a form indicating damages were not covered. I never signed a form for this, nor knew this was the case. I am a longtime southwest customer, as is my entire family, and I am completely disappointed with the lack of customer service and inconvenience that it put on my trip as a mother traveling alone with a child. My only stroller, which also was expensive, is now destroyed due to the lack of care and misplacement that was done by Southwest. "
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"26 December,",,"Flight was great. Departed and arrived right on time. Everything went smoothly until we received our luggage. There were 6 passagers and there was something broken on all of our luggage. There were broken zippers, missing wheels, ripped baggage, and plastic missing. I can't believe how mishandled our bags were. "
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"23 June,",,"All of my relatives and friends had told me I was in for a bad experience travelling by air in the United States....especially on the low cost airlines. Well, my experience was quite the opposite. Everyone on Southwest was friendly and helpful. I flew LAS-SAT, SAT-MCO and MCO-MCI and had no compliants. I dis pay the little bit extra for Early Bird check-in and would recommend that service."
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,MATTHEW STASSI,"31 May,",,"Flight delayed. Southwest rescheduled connecting flight even though we made the connection in time, so they would not allow us onboard purchased flight. We waited 8 hours for our connecting flight, arriving at 2am. Southwest sent our luggage to a different city, so we had to stay and claim lost luggage. Then the refused to deliver our lost luggage the next day. We had to drive 2 hours to get the luggage."
Southwest Airlines,3-Oct,DEREK MILLER,"16 February,",,"Absolutely worst flight Iâ€™ve had in 15 years! I will never again use this Company even if itâ€™s the absolute last resort. I was a very loyal customer of SouthWest. Rapid Rewards, Credit Card, and 100% flew Southwest every trip I took. Not Anymore! After a week long of meetings in FL im flying back to Arizona which is where I live. We had a layover in Atlanta. After flying 7 1/2 hours today my bag doesnâ€™t show up. This is where it all starts. From dealing with the associate by the terminal to dealing with the associate in the Baggage Office. Listen, I understand bags get lost everyday but as a company you should take ownership and help the customer. Not only was she short but did not apologize once. After i explained to her my medication, truck keys, etc. are in my bag itâ€™s not â€œWeâ€™ll call youâ€ easy!!! No offer of delivering my back, no credit of any kind nothing. Now Iâ€™m taking a $52 Uber ride home while I pay another day at economy parking, no medication, and oh yea work tomorrow morning at 8 am. The airport is 1 hour away from where I live."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"11 December,",,"We absolutely love southwest! It was a senstive time and we were flying for a funeral and we unfortunately left an important iten on the plane. We realized it a bit too late and the plane had gone on to its next destination. The staff at the airport was checking to see if it was turned in to no avail. Well, i recognized one of the flight attendents from the plane we were just on and sheepishly asked if there was something he knew we could do! Well, this young man went above and beyond and found our item, found where it was going, told the crew to put our name on it, and explained what we would need to do to get it back!! He was absolutely incredible and im impressed southwest has that calliber of employee.  Thank you daury!!!"
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,,"06 March,",,"SouthWest just cemented its role as my much-preferred domestic air carrier. A winter storm kept our 30-minute flight from Oakland to Reno from landing... after returning to OAK to refuel we made it on the 2nd attempt. Not SouthWest's fault, and I was grateful they still got us to RNO same day, so when the provided me with an email apology and a free travel voucher via email the next morning, I was delighted. Can anyone imagine United, American or Delta doing that? I expect they'd have deplaned us in OAK, blamed the weather and left us to fight (and pay for) our way over the Sierras. SouthWest is also much easier to book and board, does not charge for flight changes or checked bags, has the best on-time rating, and has more legroom than the legacy carriers. Thanks SouthWest! For a broader perspective on just how bad American air travel is, see the chart at https://www.1843magazine.com/travel/what-the-numbers-say/come-fly-with-me"
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"11 September,",,"People are nice but you're still treated like cattle. Southwest also added more seats so goodbye leg room, 6 foot tall people will be very cramped."
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"06 December,",,"The staff for my flight was exceptionally helpful and patient with my family.  I was travelling with my wife and 4 children; the oldest children were barely 2 years old (2 sets of twins).   We had a flight with 3 stops between El Paso, TX and Raleigh, NC, the staff did everything they could to help us manage the trip.  During each stop they went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed and helped entertain the children all while ensuring the flight kept its schedule.  While the children did have moments of discomfort with the pressure in their ears, I must say they acted wonderfully throughout the course of the entire trip.  I must give credit to the flight staff; this is in no small part due to their efforts and understanding."
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"18 February,",,Great experience.  Flying out of Cabo San Lucas Mexico on 2/14/17 on flight was delayed because of storms in Houston.  Service agent rebooked us as well as our friends on plane that was already boarding in order to get us home.  Ran with us to get us thru security and get our bags on the flight.  The agent Alejandra Solucionnes was awesome!!
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"24 May,",,I had a horrible experience here at southwest Atlanta first our flight was delayed which is understandable due to the weather but we have been delayed all day and not told any information and everytime we check the app it's a delay of push back and standing at her gate and has no idea about her flight or when or where she is suppose to go ! It's unacceptable and no has even came over to the people's flights who got delayed and offered anything free hotel just a renewed ticket ! The staff is extremely nice and doing their job it's just the way the situation was handled and especially if your flying by yourself . 
Southwest Airlines,0 / 10,David Davis,"07 November,",,I had a flight with Southwest Airlines and the customer service was the worst Iâ€™ve ever experience. I will definitely not be flying with that airline again and will be discourage  everyone i know to not fly with that airline again.
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"06 March,",,"Southwest is one of the only airlines that still cares.  United and American seem like they are trying to get our of the passenger carrying business.  Southwest is ALWAYS my first choice.  Best price, service, website, and policies."
Southwest Airlines,4-Oct,Katrina Miracle,"16 October,",,"Used to be amazing! Now, why even bother??? Used to be cheaper than the rest, especially with bags. Now, you can buy much more affordable tickets, add the price of checked bags and still be less than southwest. We fly an average of 5 times a year (always on southwest) and this is our 4th time this year being ridiculously delayed. If itâ€™s possible to even catch our connection, we will be running. And stressed to the max. To be even more annoying, every flight weâ€™ve done this year, weâ€™ve seen blokes holding seats for their family they were too cheap to buy preboard tickets for. Why is this allowed? They also let people with their grown ass kids get on with the kids under 6. You charge people extra then donâ€™t even stick to your own rules! And the worst, we chose this flight to spend the least amount of time in the airport possible, now weâ€™re just sitting sitting sitting... FOR FIVE HOURS."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"11 June,",,"I flew twice with Southwest Airlines in 2012 and they are by far the best low cost airlines I've ever flown on. For the 4th of July celebration in America, I flew from Albuquerque to El Paso to celebrate the holiday with friends. The flight left on time, a quiet but comfortable flight and likewise with my return flight to Albuquerque.
In October of 2012, I flew from Albuquerque to San Francisco via Los Angeles. The flight crew were very friendly and overall was a pleasant flight. The stopover in Los Angeles was also quick, making the trip shorter than expected.
The flight back to Albuquerque stopped over in Las Vegas. There was a slight delay departing San Francisco (SFO) due to problems with passengers documents but the flight crew kept passengers onboard entertained, making jokes and talking about Las Vegas. The connection in Las Vegas was short as well as the flight to Albuquerque.
I think it's fantastic that Southwest offer complimentary drinks and snacks, as well as two free checked in bags, low cost airlines here in Australia would never offer this service. The flights are quite cheap, supply your own computer, iPad or iPod as a source of entertainment for longer flights and you are set for a great trip!"
Southwest Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"10 January,",,"I flew to Omaha from Reno in October and from Reno to Seattle in December.  The new seats make for an uncomfortable flight.  The seat pitch is dramatically less (distance between your seat and the seat in front of you). The seats are thinner and harder with less thigh support.  Their staff remain good, although not as friendly as in the past.  The frequent flyer program now is undecipherable, I get an e mail with my ""points"" each month and have no idea as to how many I need for a free ticket.  Overall, my impression is that Southwest is now completely run by the bean counters.  They have added another row of seats and they obviously don't care how uncomfortable the passengers are, and then the airlines wonder why people are so grumpy and miserable when they fly."
Southwest Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"08 February,",,"Every experience I've had with Southwest was horrible. The most frustrating and annoying feature about their flight is the first come first serve seating, so if we are traveling as a couple or group, we early are able to sit together after the first half is seated. The seats are small and cramped already and to have to be squeeze in between two strangers is a pain. We are never flying Southwest again until they get rid of this policy!"
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,Dan Clayton,"09 April,",,"SO DISAPPOINTED. They have no way to handle weather and blame the customer. I boarded an April 7th flight from Austin to Orlando early Sunday morning connecting through Houston. Shortly after we landed they announced a weather delay for the whole airport. Within 30 minutes Southwest cancelled 75% of its flights, even though other airlines did not. Meanwhile the weather radar right on their screen is showing the weather lightening its intensity. Over the next 2 hours on the phone and at the desk they claimed no ability to help. So, having a training I had to be at Monday morning at 8AM. I rented a car and drove 14 hours. Now for the cherry on top of this accountability disaster. I called today to make double sure my return flight was still on, and I received credit for the unfulfilled leg of the journey. Good news I still have a return flight. Bad news, since I boarded in Austin to Houston I am considered to have taken the flight. No refund, no credit, no bloody acknowledgement they could not fulfill their end."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,Jana FloresJon,"03 January,",,"Be careful when renting a car through Southwest.  They offer special deals on rental cars but we found the cost to be more than if we had rented directly with Enterprise.  We were charged $10.00 per day for the extra driver which when booked directly through Enterprise (as the wife) would have been no charge.  So for seven days, that was an additional $70.00. Also, there was a large upcharge as we kept the car for additional days.
The total bill came to over $1000.00 for 7 days! Not even a full size car.   Definitely a special deal - but not for us."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"30 November,",,"I just have to say, I love Southwest. When I made a number of mistakes in timing as well as luggage management, Southwest took my problem and gave it a quick, painless solution. I cannot say how much this set the tone for my husband's and my weekend. Thank you so much for your amazing customer service and flexible flight adjustments."
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"29 June,",,"June 19, 2017 I flew out of Memphis and after a Chicago lay over, on to Las Vegas on flight 183. This was the best flight I have ever been on. The whole crew was wonderful! They kept us laughing and were very attentive. The flight was comfortable with a smooth landing. From now on if I can't fly Southwest I will drive. I recommend Southwest and give them the highest rating. "
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"03 March,",,By far the best company I've ever dealt with in my life. I've flown maybe 200 flights and every time I'm not allowed to fly southwest I find something to complain about with other airlines.  These guys have a business model that needs to be followed by all. Customer service is INSANE.. you get an actual person to talk to within seconds every time. And I've never met a bad flight attendant. Every single one of them are great genuine people. Can never say enough great things about them. RECOMMENDED HIGHLY
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"22 September,",,"On today, sept 22. 2016, Flight 532 St. Louis to Dallas. I just got off this flight and I had to let you know what happened earlier. On board we had an ocd mentally ill person gentlemen who was obsessed with being a flight attendant and was interfering with letting the crew do their job. This passenger should have been accompanied by family . I know Taylor and Joann were  2 names, And a very professional blond. Joann managed to calm this gentleman down and even let him participate in things like giving peanuts out. I can tell that had this not been handled so well this poor mentally ill gentleman could have lost it. They went above and beyond their duties to make sure he was acknowledged constantly and we were protected. It was similar to a negotiater. I was so impressed by your crew that I had to stop and write. Thank you south west. You probably touched someone's life that will never forget this and at the same time protected all others from things getting out of hand. Great job."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,Cathy Standish,"16 August,",,Great crew!  I can never say enough about the professionalism and attention to customer care that Southwest displays.  Makes every trip a pleasure.
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"18 November,",,Customer service  was  very understanding and helpful in a situation where we had  to change flights for a family emergency a day early. They were able to get us where we needed to be very quickly and very affordably. Kudos to all involved . We will continue to fly Southwest in the future . 
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"13 March,",,"Started flying this past fall. Was upgraded to A-list in 2 months( 8,000 miles) while united requires 30,000 every year! Definitely understand loyalty programs better  than United, Delta or American."
Southwest Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"05 January,",,The staff told me my connection was on time to find out when I got to my layover it was canceled. The staff was not helpful at all. 
Southwest Airlines,5-Oct,ar,"22 March,",,I was in a flight just two plus hours from another flight that would get me in about that much earlier.  Both flights were not much more than half full.  They wanted $225 to get me on the earlier flight.  Just crazy!  They admitted that some agents will do it but they did not want to?  I just did the same with Delta last week.  No more do I fly Southwest.
Southwest Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"07 January,",,"I have flown frequently on Southwest since their early days at Love Field TX. They are a low cost, friendly carrier with an excellent frequent flyer program. However their new aircraft and newly renovated ones are too uncomfortable for flights over two hours.  I complained to them about seat room and they said its now 31 inches. They did not admit that it is 17 inches with seats fully reclined. I flew BWI to San Diego and it was pure agony. I still fly them about once a month or so but switched to United economy plus on an upcoming cross country flight.  More expensive but I can still stand by 6'1 frame upright after their flight."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"28 December,",,This is my favourite US carrier. I recently flew on their 737-800 and 737 Max jets. The flights I took were LAX-LAS // LAS-SEA // PHX - LAX. You get what you pay for. They leave all other carriers in the US for service and inclusions. I LOVE that you don't have to pay for your luggage (just make sure you are under weight as they are very strict). The boarding process is always simple and easy and you get a drink and peanuts/prestzels when you board. The crew always seem happy to be there as do all the staff. Southwest will ALWAYS be my first choice when travelling within America. 
Southwest Airlines,3-Oct,,"17 May,",,"I had booked this trip from Denver to Las Vegas five months ago. I had booked this as a surprise for my best friend as a bachelorette/Birthday party. This was a $700.00 surprise. We were on flight 799 from Denver to Vegas at 5:25AM. Landed in Vegas at about 6am Vegas time. We go to get our baggage and only one bag arrived. We submitted a report at 6:40am for the lost bag. Throughout the morning as we waited for a ""15 minute "" call back, no one called us, no one updated me, and no one can tell me where the bag is! We are now sitting in Vegas and the person/reason for being here HAS NONE OF HER THINGS! Not only does she not have her things,her fiancÃ© hid a surprise card with money in it. There is roughly $600 dollars of makeup, brand new clothing and other valuables in her bag. It is now 9:30am the NEXT DAY and they still can't find my friends bag nor did they call me... I called them AGAIN to get no new information. I'm need more compensation then a measly $50 ""travel voucher"" that I can't even use unless I SPEND MORE MONEY ON A FLIGHT! This has been the absolute WORST experience. When we were getting on the plane to come home they offered someone a $600 travel voucher for their next flight if they changed flights because they oversold it. We are now back from our trip and they still canâ€™t find the bag. We are not even allowed to start the process of reimbursement until after 5 days. You may call me at (509) 869 8539 or email me at charleyperry33@gmail.com"
Southwest Airlines,7-Oct,Wendy Cooper,"29 October,",,"Beware the Anytime fare that promises early bird check in but does not actually provide it. 
We talked to 3 customer service agents live, and spent an hour on the phone.  They literally could not provide what was clearly advertised &amp; sold to me. 
After the hour on the phone we were advised to pay the $50 upgrade fees and they gave us $100 vouchers for the trouble."
Southwest Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"02 June,",,"Route was LAX - BWI - LAX over the Memorial Day weekend. I was new to Southwest, so learned about the boarding process as I went. LAX - BWI was fine because I had B05 (ticket was a gift), and there was no pushing or shoving. Coming back I did not check in until five minutes after the 24-hour start time (trouble finding site), so got B56. I arrived at BWI three hours before departure  so I could purchase a lower number, and bought A05 for $40. It turned out to be a connecting flight, though, and there were multiple preboarders. I found a window seat in 4th row, with a woman sitting in the aisle. At first she wouldn't let me take the seat until she confirmed I was alone b/c she ""didn't want to sit next to someone."" I sat in my seat, and she left her massive purse on the middle seat through two crew announcements to stop blocking seats. Finally she was forced to let someone sit there b/c theflight was full. If not for that she would have gotten away with claiming two seats for the price of one. My reminder that we're not allowed to do that was met with hostility.

Southwest needs to be a lot more alert to seat hogging. Boarding ended up being stressful, and I won't be flying SW again."
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"10 January,",,"Great airline! They just saved the day for me and my little sister! When Frontier couldn't do their jobs Southwest was there to get it done!
I have flown with them numerous times and never really had a problem! I will continue to be a loyal customer!  "
Southwest Airlines,3-Oct,ar,"19 December,",,"If there was a way to give a - star ... they would get a few.
The service received on Southwest airlines is the worse I have encounter! I flew this airlines many times in the past and stopped due to the service, tried again this week... AND THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED!
The gate agents are rude, the customer service contact is non existent. The only people you can reach via the phone are reservation people and they have been instructed not to take complaints as NO ONE AT SOUTHWEST HEADQUARTERS WILL CALL YOU BACK... their statement not mine.
IF SOUTHWEST IS GIVING AWAY FREE FLIGHTS... TAKE A CAR! IT IS NOT WORTH THE AGGRAVATION TO FLY WITH SOUTHWEST!

If by any chance anyone at Southwest reads these... it is not the delays, it is not the planes... it is the people that make a business good or bad and it is the policies concerning the care of the customer. You need to train your people and review the policies of how to treat people that are missing connections, and set up a customer service line that is for just that... customer service."
Southwest Airlines,7-Oct,ar,"02 April,",,"Southwest airlines was great, love free checked bags and carry on. Staff was awesome. Just disappointed that our flight was changed and we were not compensated in any way.  "
Southwest Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"08 April,",,"SERVICE??!!!!  March24 Arriving at BWI at 855am. Asked that gate attendant if I was at right gate for my connection.  No one else present...she looked at my boarding pass for one second and said check the board and pointed to the screen.  I checked - it was on time - so I sat down.  When preboarding started for a flight to Connecticut I asked why...  They said my plane was two terminals away so I ran.  The door was closed. I had to wait 6 hours for the next flight
If she had taken a minute to help...!!!!!  I will never use southwest again if I can avoid them."
Southwest Airlines,3-Oct,,"04 November,",,"Southwest sent me an email very late last night stating that they have changed my upcoming flight by 2.5 hours. No reason was given. They also did not call me to discuss the consequences of this change to me.. I wrote to their customer service and they replied that previously they would call the affected customer to discuss alternatives. Now they only state that I can cancel and get a refund ""If I do not like their change"". I asked for early boarding on the affected flight and their reply to that was absolutely no."
Southwest Airlines,9-Oct,ar,"01 February,",,"We fly Southwest 6-8  times a year and they are exceptional.  Service is great and the past three flights have arrived AHEAD of schedule.  Changing or cancelling flights is a simple, painless process.  They are head and shoulders above other airlines we have flown."
Southwest Airlines,2-Oct,ar,"03 October,",,"Be aware that you must pay extra in order to sit near your loved ones, otherwise you are stuck in a middle seat betweeen strangers"
Southwest Airlines,10-Oct,ar,"30 May,",,"What a wonderful time I always have when I fly Southwest. I won't travel on any other airline, unless I'm not paying. They have a lifetime customer with me! If you haven't tried them yet, by all means, do...I doubt you'll regret it!"
Southwest Airlines,6-Oct,ar,"31 March,",,"I recently flew on your airline with my family of 5. On the flight, directly across from us was a young lady with her cat.  My 6 year old son started sneezing unconcontrollably... UNCONTROLLABLY.  the poor boy could not breathe between  sneezes. I wasn't sure what to do so I asked the flight attendant to move us.  She said. ... No. She said there was NOTHING she could do. She didn't move us and she was not concerned with helping us at all. I finally switched seats with him to help a bit as I had a window seat.  I am very disappointed in the airline- which we travel with all the time.  It seems unreal that a child with a cat allergy must sit next to cat an entire flight and suffer.

EDITORS COMMENT: Really? We had no idea a cat could fly on a plane with their owner. Bizarre!"
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,Edward Walters,"04 July,",,"Simply put, SWA is overrated. The biggest complaint is the boarding process.  It is advertised as this entirely democratic, first-come-first served system. The reality is quite different. Despite going on their website exactly 24 hours ahead of departure, we ended up in about the middle of the line. Priority is now given to those willing to pay a fee or who are enrolled in their credit card or whatever. The three of us almost ended up not getting to sit together.  Thankfully, on the remaining legs of the trip, the kind gate agents let us priority board despite the fact that our child is over six. I will not name the routes to protect them. Otherwise, it was okay. SWA is not bad, it simply is not the leader it used to be."
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"05 April,",,"Excellent flight to and from Vegas, look forward to doing it again next year!"
Southwest Airlines,8-Oct,ar,"23 April,",,"There is a lot to say about this airline.
It was my first time flying on Southwest. I went round-trip from Newark, NJ to Houston, TX in April 2014 and I could not believe how attentive these staff were. I was asleep on my flight to Houston and they got me a can of soda out of nowhere once I woke up! I have flown a lot on long flights like these and the staff usually do nothing on airlines like United, but the crew on Southwest went a lot farther. Some things I did not like were the uncomfortable seats (but most airlines have the same seats anyway) and the delay we got on my flight to Newark, which the flight attendants apologized at the end of the flight. That is something I don't see on an airline. I would highly recommend Southwest to anyone."
