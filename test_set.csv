0,"Not Verified |  We travelled on Singapore Airlines many years ago in economy class. We travelled this time in business class because of the long flight. The service provided on the latest trip was very good, however we did pre order some food that disappointingly did not arrive but the flight menu options were good. The biggest problem we had was the seating arrangements in business class, the seats were hard and uncomfortable. A weird cover was provided to increase comfort. The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable. I do not understand why Singapore Airlines would ever believe that their seating arrangements would provide comfort. Cost is huge for these additional benefits for both comfort and health as older people travelling. The outcome is of course we won’t be travelling business class with Singapore Airlines again which is really sad.",3.0,Singapore Airlines

3,EK 772 CPT to DXB. Flight was on a Boeing 777-300. Boarding was on time and it was fast. Take off about 30 minutes late but even with almost 30 minutes holding time in DXB plane was still on time or schedule. Crew was nice and food choices was matched. I even got a second hot meal as I was still hungry. Bags were on belt when we arrived there. Only downturn was that the full plane got a remote stand and we had to take the bus to the terminal which took almost another 30 minutes. Would fly EK again since the legroom was great in economy.,5.0,Emirates
4,I booked a fairly priced return ticket between Dublin and Edinburgh in May 2015. The experience was horrible. I think the check-in and baggage drop works okay as long as you only have hand luggage and a European or UK passport. If you need to check in a bag or you require a visa it's absolute chaos. There is no clear signage the staff keeps directing you to a different queue that already has at least 50 people waiting. This was the closest I've ever come to missing a flight. The price of my ticket increased threefold with the bag I checked in (less than 20kg btw) and they even charge 15 euro to print your boarding pass. This borders on criminal if you ask me. I will never ever fly with Ryanair again and I will go out of my way to let people know how bad the service is.,2.0,Ryanair
5,"I had thought it was not possible to have a worse call centre experience than Foxtel. I was wrong. Singapore Airlines was happy to correct me. I made three calls over three hours, to change a reward booking. First failed because the agent finally said she couldn’t actually execute a reward booking, and couldn’t contact anyone who could. The second because the agent said she had no way to identify the replacement flight that I wanted. I knew city and date, but not flight number. The third, after half an hour, finally realised that I was dealing with a redemptions booking and again said she had no authority or ability to deal with it. It appears that whatever button you press on the menu on the way in, after about 45mins on hold it just puts you to the general staff.",1.0,Singapore Airlines
6,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago Midway to Newark. It is irritating when you travel with an airline 5 times and a flight gets canceled every. Single.  I can understand the cancellations due to the weather. I can also understand the cancelations due to ""scheduled maintenance "" (badly scheduled if the plane was supposed to be flying though.) What I don't understand is how thinking that leaving your customers stranded overnight at the airport is ok. It is not. Allowing the customers to reschedule ""for free"" for a flight the airline canceled should not even be a question much less something that gets thrown in your face. No attempt or offer was made for a hotel or another place to spend the night. No offer or attempt was made to get us back into the same boarding position we had prior to our flight being canceled due to ""scheduled maintenance "" Delays are irritating but at least you get where you want to. Unscheduled cancelations are not ok. Being forced to stay in the bagging area overnight because security shuts down the terminals overnight, is not ok.",1.0,Southwest Airlines
7,✅ Trip Verified |  Check in at Jersey straightforward. There is a small business class lounge at Jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food. Flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at LHR. Captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at Heathrow. Good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served. Disappointing that the wait for cases at Heathrow T5 was as long as the flight!,4.0,British Airways
8,"TSA randomly selects people for a secondary screening at the gate, which is out of all airlines control. However, with most airlines assigned seating, this only affects the flight you are selected for the screening for and doesn’t affect your boarding. With Southwest’s check in and reservation system, getting selected for secondary screening means you are in for major issues. Southwest’s well rehearsed response by phone support, check in personnel and gate agents, for the multiple impacts, is that it is not our fault’. That you were selected by the TSA, not Southwest, so you get nothing from Southwest to help rectify the situation of getting a late C group number when you went to all the trouble to check in and your spouse on the same reservation gets A group.

It is true that it is TSA for being selected for the extra secondary security screening for the first flight. However, all the issues on subsequent connecting fights are caused by Southwest's reservation system and boarding process. There is no reason not to get assigned your legitimate place in line on the rest of your connecting flights as the TSA screening has nothing to do with them. Even worse then not being able to board with the rest of your party on the reservation on subsequent flights, is losing your TSA Pre Check from paying for Global Entry on the rest of your connecting flights. On international flights you usually need to go through security again after clearing customs. On my recent trip back from Mexico, the rest of my party with TSA Pre Check cleared security in 5 minutes and then waited another 50 minutes for me to finally show up. This is very much Southwest's issue. Other airlines with different reservation systems have none of these issues.

There are things that Southwest could have and should have done on my connecting flight. I clearly should have had an A group number as all other folks on the reservation with me did. All the numbers are gone since the Southwest system would not assign my connecting flight boarding position since it wouldn’t assign the 1st flight. However, Southwest lets ""special circumstance"" folks board after the A group, before the B group. When I asked the gate agent in Miami, Monica V., if there was anything I could do to board at least close to the rest of my party, she parroted the party line that is was TSA’s fault and that there was nothing she could do. When I mentioned boarding after the A’s, she got that hostile look like I was just another low life trouble maker trying to cheat my way onto the plane before my turn. She stated that was ONLY for disabled passengers and my issue was not a Southwest problem.

An even better solution is for Southwest to still issue you your boarding position number for your connecting flights and not remove TSA PRE from your connecting flight boarding pass",1.0,Southwest Airlines
9,"✅ Verified Review | Flew Berlin Schönefeld to Cologne/Bonn. Ryanair at its best, I guess. Very punctual and quick boarding. Paid 20 euros, which is absolutely unbeatable by FR's competitors Air Berlin and Eurowings. Paid 10 euros extra for seat 1A which - apart from the great legroom - turned out to be a good choice. Since FR's planes have stairs of their own and they hardly use buses for boarding I was first out of the plane and litteraly in my car 10 mins after touch down in CGN. And almost 20 mins ahead of schedule. This whole flight oozed efficiency, which is FR's core bussines. The only downside is that they use Berlin Schönefeld: far from the centre and with the appeal of maximum security prison.",5.0,Ryanair
10,OAK - HOU round trip 73Fs both ways and I was in Seat 5F going and 4F on the return. Evolve Interior not bad and my only complaint is a lack of power ports. Cute cookies. Staff not at all bad. Only real complaint was that outbound flight was delayed but they made up for the delay in the air so even though I literally ran through HOU I did pick up my rental car before they closed for the day.,4.0,Southwest Airlines
11,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Lima return in Business Class. No choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra (I understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying £50+pp per flight if you aren't is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). By the time we were able to check in, there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together. New BA lounge at LGW smart but packed out at the start of Easter holidays. Limited food offering at breakfast - no hot food at all, unless you count lukewarm pastries. FA service on flights in both directions was good, though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services, despite it being a day flight. Food and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time they got to us. Seating layout of 2-4-2 in business class is very cramped, especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating I've ever experienced in business - and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open. Small drawer at your feet. Recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you're travelling solo - no legs to climb over! Lie-flat seat was comfortable though for a short person. IFE was poor compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available. On the way home we didn't mind a long layover at LIM as we thought we could use the lounge. No such luck - we couldn't be checked in all the way through from LPB so had to pick up luggage, go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in the flight home. Only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair. Very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me, otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger! Haven't travelled long-haul with BA for several years and can only describe it as a functional, value service, even in Business, though it's not cheap. I'd only use BA again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from London), or for a great price on short-haul. There's really no comparison to Emirates' long-haul offering in Business.",4.0,British Airways
12,✅ Trip Verified |  Very impolite and rude cabin crew from ticketing counter to inside the plane. No just they don’t want help but also ignore you. And you try to catch the attention they literally yell and pass sarcastic comments. I was traveling with my 1 year old. They made our flight a horrible experience and on purpose they did not offer baby food in a 7 hour flight. All crew looked unhappy and were unpleasant to talk with mostly female crews. My flight from Dubai to Algeria was a nightmare because of crew negative behavior and lack of empathy for a mother who’s was traveling with a 1 year old.,2.0,Emirates
13,"✅ Trip Verified | Could British Airways get any worse? Flew Chicago - London Heathrow in Upper Deck / Club World, of ancient B747-400, British Airways business class is the worst in the entire global airline industry. The seats are the crazy / odd facing each other, with a rude screen, and are terribly uncomfortable / narrow. They must be at least a decade out of date. The food / wine was simply awful, and they didn't have the lamb on the menu, but replaced it with some kind of beef mush. The crew were young, uneducated, and unprofessional. They were waiters and waitresses at best, and didn't seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people. Club Class on this route was also full of screaming children, one of whom threw up on the flight. WHY do BA hold their premium customers in such contempt? I can give you the answer: They have a monopoly from the UK to the USA, and back, and no legitimate competition.",1.0,British Airways
14,"I have spent the past 9 years travelling between the UK and Thailand, with various airlines. Where BA is concerned, neither the food, hospitality or entertainment can compare with that of  Etihad, Emirates or Qatar, none of which I experienced delays with. The only airline I did endure a delay with was BA. The delay meant that I missed my pre-booked trains and incurred costs of almost 90 pounds. I tried to claim my expenses but BA arrogantly denied responsibility. They also informed me that they were not a member of the ombudsman scheme set up to ensure consumers get a fair deal. This itself suggests that they put profit above customer satisfaction.
Where there is a choice I would strongly recommend flying with one of the other airlines and only using BA as a last resort",1.5,British Airways
15,"What a horrible airline Scoot is...in March of 2019 I flew to Bangkok to pick up our son... the evening before leaving they cancelled the flight. 2 days later border's closed around the world. It cost me $1295 to fly home, alone. I got my airfares refunded months later. I flew back with them on 9th June 2022... I was transiting from phuket to Bangkok that evening and told the ground crew on Gold Coast who marked both my boarding passes transiting. The flight from Singapore was 45-50 minutes late... I was carrying cabin baggage only. The cabin crew insisted I stow the bag... I explained the situation and they assured me it would be OK. As the flight progressed the pilot indicated that we would land now slightly more than 1 hour late. I approached the cabin manager and we discussed the situation for a long period. She assured me that she would contact their ground staff who would have my bag ready and escort me quickly to my transit flight. She made it clear that this was Scoots fault....None of this happened... I had to wait for my bag at the carousel and ground crew assistance was zero. Subsequently I missed my flight by 4 minutes and 30 seconds. Purely by luck and having travelled extensively I found the last flight out of Phuket that night. I had a car booked and 4 nights hotel accommodation. I lost my original fare and car transport and it cost me nearly 3 times the cost to get to Bangkok. I lodged a complaint via messenger on FB with their FB page... I have phoned their customer assistance line in Singapore several times... I spoke with their reps at Phuket and Singapore... NOT INTERESTED! FINALLY I SPOKE WITH SCOOT AUSTRALIA... HELPFUL BUT COULD DO NOTHING ALSO. Here is the kicker... I showed loyalty and got another spit in the face!

18,"My daughter was flying from Rochester to Orlando for a cheer competition in Disney with her team and coach. When she arrived in Orlando she realized she had lost her wallet. I want to compliment the honesty, integrity, and helpfulness of the Southwest employees involved in getting the wallet returned in tact including the cash and gift cards that were inside. Her wallet ended up in Birmingham, Alabama where I was assisted by two extremely helpful staff. They were as extremely helpful in instructing me how to get the wallet mailed back and gave me the good news that the cash and gift cards were still inside. I don't know if a passenger found it and turned it in or if it was one of the crew that found it on the airplane. All I know is I am impressed how this scary experience for my daughter turned out so well because of the quick and honest actions of the Southwest employees.

26,✅ Trip Verified |  Still sitting in the airplane 2 hours after boarding. First hold up was supposedly because extra maintenance checks had to be done for over an clean flights. Second hold up was for weight and balance issues. They were literally moving 5 people around the plane and there were only 10 empty seats total. Then as we are pushing back from the gate the pilot comes on and says he is out of hours. We were 10 ft from the gate and he pulled back up and got off. 20 minutes later a new captain comes on and basically has to start all over. Just got word that they were topping off the gas. How is it you have to top off the gas if we were pushing from the gate 45 minutes ago. Southwest really needs to look at their management and processes. This is definitely a 1 star flight.,1.0,Southwest Airlines

We were not charged anything for this and the ground staff were very professional and helpful. The flight were good seats were as comfortable as economy gets and the entertainment was excellent. The cabin crew were polite and very professional. The food was really good. Because we were headed all the way to Sydney we had to try and get on another flight at Singapore.

Ryanair staff in both Stansted and Pisa, were extremely rude with multiple passengers complaining about a rude member of ground staff from our outbound flight from Stansted. Ryanair have a policy where you must to pay a £25 charge if you choose to bring  a small roll on luggage for which there is ample room for and can be easily stored in the overhead locker on the aircraft. The £25 is due if you do not pay for ‘Priority boarding’ that allows you to carry on a small bag and roll on luggage for £8 ; for which there are only a limited number of spaces available and is almost always sold out. My husband was required to pay this fee and was also told by a member of staff, that he has been ignorant and had obviously ‘ignored’ his emails - which was not the case. If not there is the option to check in a 10kg case for the price of £20.40 each way. Which amounts to £40.80, for only a long weekend away. Apart from the extra costs that were not clear to me on the Ryanair website or app.  As we were at Pisa airport and boarding the plane I was given a telling off from one of the Pisa Ryanair staff for trying to assist them as we were one of the last to board by attaching the luggage tag to my husbands small roll-on luggage after we had paid the £25 fee for it (that we would now have to wait for at the baggage carousel at London Stansted airport, despite finding out that there was more than enough room for it inside the overhead lockers when we boarded the plane) and repeatedly asked ‘Why, Why, Why?!’ I had possibly attached the tag to the bag, which is completely acceptable in the UK, to which I responded that ‘I was trying to help as I could see they were tight on time’ and told firmly ‘not to do it, that is not good and Why would you do that?’. We are disgusted by the way we have been treated by Ryanair staff and by all of the extra costs that were added. We were drawn to the airline due to the flights being the cheapest at the time, however would rather pay more for a professional, courteous service without the extra costs. After calculating these costs, e, this worked out as more expensive than other airlines that we did not book with due to the fact that Ryanair seemed cheaper. Please, do your research before booking with this airline and if you would like to be treated professionally and in a courteous manner and avoid paying for things that should be and are included with other airlines... then do not book with Ryanair.

When I went to board the flight I was told I could not as the payment had not gone through. I was told to go to arrivals and talk with someone in Skyline desk. I never received a email, text or phone call to say that the payment didn't go through.  I was given a piece of paper with website, call center and working hours. Could not get through to the phone number so went on live chat with Ryanair, got no help, then i told them how terrible it was to be left in Athens and then i was told to contact the Fraud Department - of course no response. I had to buy a ticket from a  travel agent at the airport (so helpful and understand of my situation), go to Paris and then Dublin with Air France, for 210 euro, but money and time well spent. I had the money to book the ticket with the same card I used with Ryanair, and knowing the way Ryanair operates, there was no point in loosing my sanity over a badly run airline.

53,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra?

However, on landing at gate 25, passengers cannot disembark until other planes close by have taken off or landed, causing a delay in getting off the plane.  A passenger then is required to walk the entire length of the airport, through baggage claim and then exit to the non-flight side. Climb stairs and go back in through security and x-ray. the queues are long and there is no concession for connecting passengers. then walk back through the entire length of the airport with the addition of negotiating a maze of shops and restaurants. I therefore got to my gate a couple of minutes late. Despite the fact that i can get on the plane with no issues. The dispatcher refused to let me on the plane, and removed my bag! Acting as if I am a bad school boy and deserves detention, not a paying customer!

Rules they stateâ€¦.and they claim on their adverts that they wish to serve. I am told I can purchase a new flight and go to enquiries to complain about the queues and to locate a hotel. No help at all, their attitude was also smug as they were clearly delighted to have me stranded. I promptly walked over to Swiss air desk, where the lady quickly sold me a low cost flight, despite the fact that the plane was due to leave in 45 minutes.

From the moment the plane was to take off the complaining started. I guess there was some sort of issue with the transair merger and the flight attendant union because that is all I heard about for the entire flight. They just went on and on as if they were out for coffee at some cafe. I don't even think they realized how inappropriate it was to complain while they were on the job and within earshot of customers. It made us very uncomfortable and annoyed. Once we landed and all of bags didn't make it that kind of sealed the deal for us. No more Southwest.

It was confirmed that this would be fine. When we got to the airport we made sure it was still ok as my mother has limited mobility and finds air travel extremely difficult. They confirmed again that they had kept the seat we had paid for. When we got to the gate my mother had paid for priority boarding but a stuff up by the staff there meant we were left waiting to get onto the plane until after they had removed one of the sets of stairs. When we finally got onto the plane we found a lady sitting in our seat with a ticket for the very seat we had paid for. Not only did Ryanair representatives lie directly on a number of times to me they had sold the seat within 30 minutes of our first contacting them regarding the flight issue.

72,6 flights in July. Auckland - Singapore SGN-BKK Da Nang - SGN. SGN - Cebu. Cebu - SGN and SGN-AKL. All were full. At least 3 were late to varying degrees. On at least one occasion I suspect the delay was not due to congestion at Da Nang for goodness sake but due to late arrival. Only the first flight seemed a bit superior. That seemed to me to be small differences eg - a decent filled roll as a snack but mainly the staff worked hard all the time and seemed to have a service ethic. The food well - Take the coffee cup the wine glass the tub of water and the roll off the tray and really you are not left with much. Surprisingly the food on the SIN - BKK flight at 1600 hours was much the same as on a long flight. However usually it was a dry entree or a few small pieces of fruit plus in effect a snack box sized meal. The Cebu - SGN flight arriving at around 2030 about 1.5 hours late offered a snack box with 3 small cubes of chicken and a cm deep flavoured rice and perhaps a piece of broccoli - most children eat more. Spirits were not offered on the longer flights although they were available out of view nor wine top ups. A beer amounted to perhaps 80 mls that is 4 pours to the can. A little generosity goes a long way as does the impression of parsimony. Overall much the same as other airlines. The best food was on a Vietnam Air 1.25 hour flight where they managed to serve and clear a good meal. Although Singapore seemed to cope with routine any variation seemed to cause problems. One confirmed flight was rescheduled and a second rescheduled to another with a stopover making it two hours longer. Both were weeks in advance. I don't believe either flight was in fact rescheduled rather I was bumped. In the latter case although I was notified of a rescheduling it was much later that I noticed it was in fact a route change. On the return flight which had been altered some months before I had paid for a preferred seat. This was confirmed that I had the same seat. However in fact on the day I was given a non-preferred seat in the centre. This was drawn to the cabin crews’attention and they informed me they would and did inform the appropriate department as if that helped me at the time. Three weeks later no response. A refund would not even compensate for the relative discomfort. Had that seat not been available I would have taken the day flight on the un-refurbished plane they left us with for a year until they introduce a new plane.,4.0,Singapore Airlines

Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route.

London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap.

Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?).

85,"Not Verified |  London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other.

They seemed to take pleasure in making my experience as miserable as possible. I've flown with a lot of budget airlines in the past, but Ryanair takes the cake for being the worst. Their business practices are nothing but shady and underhanded, and I would never recommend anyone fly with them. Save yourself the headache and book with a more reputable airline!",1.0,Ryanair

90,"✅ Trip Verified |  Malaga to Tangier with Ryanair. The problems with this flight included a lack of communication over a delay. I looked online and discovered that the flight was delayed leaving Dublin and thus arrived delayed into Malaga. The boarding process was a success in that staff enforced and reinforced the priority system. The aircraft was filthy and had trash on the floor and the windows were also unclean. The young cabin crew had little presence and did not deal with a group of rowdy Spanish teenagers. Disemembarkation was poorly managed too and this flight created a very poor image of the airline. I have been rather put off using Ryanair as a consequence of this experience. I shall add that some passengers only Spoke Arabic and that non of the cabin crew and none of the announcements were made in Arabic, I believe this is a safety issue.",4.0,Ryanair

Only negative is minor, just that they improve on the traditional British meals.

He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them.

The Melbourne to Wellington flight is an early morning flight, arriving in Wellington in the afternoon just in time for most hotel check-ins. The short-haul international flight serves one round of meals with 4 options for mains available. I went for the cheese omelette and it was great. Cabin service was exceptional as usual. However, the aircraft itself is very dated, especially the seats. The seats are in a 2-2-2 configuration, and it's not the best Singapore Airlines Business Class seats. It's okay for the short-haul flight, as they turn into flat-angled beds. There's lots of leg space and decent width. In-flight entertainment technology was dated, but the content is good in terms of library and variety. All in all, it's definitely the best Melbourne-Wellington offering (when compared to narrow-bodied aircrafts of Qantas, Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand), but it's not the best SQ offering.",5.0,Singapore Airlines

Dinner was well presented. We missed breakfast as we were asleep. Departure and arrival on time. Aircraft equipped with older ICE but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. Main negatives at check-in and upon arrival. I was very surprised that our reserved seats (9 K and J) were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. I am platinum with QF (code share on this flight) so got a bit upset as the check-in staff at the first class check- in in BKK tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. After rejecting this seat change lady suddenly ""found"" seats 10 K and J for us. Could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available (managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 K & J and they had no status with EK or QF). Second negative aspect of the trip during luggage collection at SYD. Even though our 2 suitcases were both properly labeled with ""First"" labels and we checked-in at BKK 2.5 hours prior to departure our suitcases appeared as one of the last items on the belt in Sydney. As I said to my wife first economy passengers of our flight were already checking in to their hotels in Sydney while we were still waiting for our baggage.

108,First of all Ryanair are a budget airline so don't expect anything other than a basic service. The seat pitch is famously squashed but for an extra fee you can book priority seats with extra legroom and priority boarding.

109,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cabin crew were amazing, the flight from ORD to Dubai was great, the airplane was spotless, food was average, or below average but the economy seats and entertainment were above average. The flight from Dubai to Cairo was almost at equal standing, bathrooms were dirty most of the time though, the main problem that will prohibit me from recommending this airline to anyone is the experiences that I had with their ground crews in Chicago and in Dubai. Counter check-in and package drop off process overall with Emirates were the least efficient out there between the other lines that were checking in at the same time, needless to say that I spent almost 45-60 mins to finalize this step while the whole infamous TSA passport control process took less than 15 mins from start to finish on that busy day. When I finally made it to the check-in counter and I presented my Emirates compliant (not country-specific, Emirates ask for more than that) PCR test, they questioned whether or not I meet the time requirement simply because they compared the sample collection date and time in (CST) with the final destination departure time which was in Dubai local time without accounting for the time difference, after explaining that she took the test and disappeared for 10 mins before returning with the stamp of approval. Right after that she printed our 3 boarding passes for the trip to Dubai and beyond and asked to place our two carry-ons and two backpacks containing our personal items (our laptops, tablets, snacks, medicine, toys, and a change of cloth for our 4-year-old toddler) she stated that they will all be treated as carry-ons and that we were only allowed to bring two of them on board, and that if we don’t we will need to pay $200.00 in extra fees, or we can take our backpacks and check-in our carry-ons, she explained that this carry-ons restriction were a company policy imposed due to Covid, what does Covid has to do with the carry-ons and personal items allowance policy? I never had this experience ever with any other airline including my previous flights thru Emirates & Etihad, no one ever considered my laptop carrying bag as a carryon it was always listed as a personal item which I was allowed to bring on board to stow underneath my seat, I was in a state of shock and I told her that those carry-ons contained items with rechargeable batteries but that didn’t seem to sway her mind, I was in no position to argue at that point and took as much as I could from those rechargeable items form those carry-ons stuffing it into our backpacks just to follow my own safety protocols, on flight I saw many passengers boarding the airplane with their carry-ons and backpacks, and I highly doubt that they paid the $200 they wanted us to pay at the counter! Finally, the point where I completely snapped asking to see the supervisor on-site is when she-alongside another colleague of hers stated that my toddler' aviation approved child seat was not allowed inside the cabin and then they tried to charge me for an extra fourth seat claiming that to bring this on-board I’ll have to pay for an extra seat! I was like my child is 4 years old, we paid for his seat ticket of which we will place this child's seat! nothing changed their mind until the supervisor came, and I told her that we have three tickets for all 3 passengers, and she agreed with our point of view.

112,"✅ Trip Verified |   First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying. Emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as 2nd class passengers without any rights. My wife and I flew to Spain and Portugal from Singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group. On our return flights first from Madrid to Dubai on EK142 on 9 Oct 2023 and from Dubai to Singapore on EK 354 on 10 Oct 2023, my wife and I were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft. When I enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the 2 flights as I am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder (which has been affecting me for the past 5 years), the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat 6 rows ahead. She said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from Dubai to Singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in Dubai for help. When we reached Dubai, the tour manager, my wife and I, another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to B18 boarding gate. The guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the 2 counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter. He told us to use the self-help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats. The computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter. The guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and I in the queue. However, our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter. There was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff. Eventually one of the staff involved in the 'conversation' told the guard to admit all of us and 'royally allowed' us to talk to him behind the counter. He told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as 'non-paying' passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated. Our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial/partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows 81 to 83 and he could not help in any way. My question to the airline is this: if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial/partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together. What happens if there are families with young children? Furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats (say rows 61 to 63 or 81 to 83 and not all window seats or not all middle seats) in advance why can't it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers' preference and needs? Even in times of profit squeeze when corporations try to extract every cent from its passengers, how much money can you make to justify discriminating and alienating your passengers just because the 25 of them are travelling as part of a package tour?",2.0,Emirates

Negative - no in-flight entertainment (no TV screens). So download films onto your mobile device and watch during flight. But you have to pay for power (£6.00 each way). Negative - stodgy, microwave food that you have to pay for. Top tip - eat in the departure lounge and take drinks and sandwiches with you for the flight. Negative - have to pay for all drinks, and they only take credit cards (no cash and no debit cards). Negative - no pillows or blankets, so take your own. In the end, you can pay about £80 more for these extras, that you wouldn't pay on a full service airline.

The dishes had little flavor. Only positive points: the quality of the wines, including Champagne and the plate of cheese. The device ""wifi"" control of audiovisual instruments did not work, despite the repair efforts of a hostess much more experienced, pleasant and smiling, that we saw that during the claim. The limousine service promised in the price of the ticket is non-existent in Phuket, for reasons never explained, and the car provided to Dubai was the worst, dented on its flank must, while we have well reminded the hostess of the counter. we were theoretically entitled to two cars, having two separate tickets.

On a 2 hour flight, comfort is not a huge factor, I found Ryanair average, but no worse than easyJet. Staff friendly on return leg, seemed tired on outward leg. As long as they do their safety part fine, not a big issue, and I’m sure they did.",5.0,Ryanair

I was scheduled to fly from Taiwan at 1:30am and transfer from singapore to Bali at 7:15 am, but when I arrived at Taiwan airport I was told that my flight was delay for 3 hours without prior notification, so my second flight will be canceled cuz the first flight cant make it on time.  I asked the flight attendant at Taiwan for my second flight information, the flight attendant simply inform me that she didnt know and ask me to find information at singapore airport.  Flight attendant at singapore airline help me to arrange to next flight which is fine. I kept asking whether I still need to check in my baggage manually but she told me that they will arrange it for me. When i arrived at Bali for baggage claim, I waited for 3 hours for my baggage which i found that my baggage still in Singapore.

137,"I flew business class on the SQ23 from NYC to Singapore on Jan 4th.
The flight was OK. Singapore air are cheap on wifi offering in business class. They need to learn from KLM/Delta/AirFrance classic hospitality. As for food options, not impressed. They don't offer salads and healthy snacks. They are too fixated on offering large variety of alcohol liquors. Again, they need to benchmark SKY TEAM for first class hospitality !!!
The nightmare started when I landed in Singapore.
Upon arrival, my luggage did not arrive with me. Upon checking with customer service at the airport, they indicated my luggage was not loaded on the plane in NYC. They said, my luggage was forwarded to LA for next day delivery to Singapore - RED FLAG1. WHY would sing air send it to LA when another flight from NYC will be departing the following day ??.
For next 8 days, I daily called the airline to find out the status. Please note, I was calling. No one from sing air called me!. I kept getting the same scripted answer. We are searching for your luggage. Finally, on day #9 my luggage arrived. My suite case was filthy and destroyed. It is like someone dragged along the runway for a long time. The fabric was ripped in 5 spots. Arm handle was broken.
When I opened it, beside spoiled goods, I discovered several stolen xmas gift items.
I submitted a claim on Jan 14th for spoiled and stolen goods. Till now, March 5th, I am still chasing Singapore airline for compensation with no light at the end of the tunnel.
To add insult to injury. Singapore airline, reached out to me regarding the damaged suite case. They said, my 27 inch Samsonite is a fake one - RED FLAG2. Please note, I bought it from Macy's in the USA 20 months ago and only used it 3 times. I replied to Singapore airline and indicated there must be miss understanding. This is genuine. But, they insisted it is a fake Samsonite. I finally gave up and asked them to replace it with identical Fake one - they can buy it from Macy's online. They said NO. They will either give me 180 SGD or American Tourister brand as a replacement.

Key takeaway from all of this. Singapore Airline is a fake façade of customer focus and service. Next time I will go back to fly SKY Team (KLM/ Delta / Air France). They are first class airline with genuine customer service focus. BTW, I have never ever had this type of experience with them.",1.0,Singapore Airlines
138,"✅ Verified Review |  British Airways use a version of the 747 with a minimal number of economy seats on this route from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. Every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied. They make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area. Seats are narrow, seat cushions are hard, and I had a ""large"" person next to me both trips. I paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible. Food was passable and no more, but there were two meals on the long flight. Cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training - polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights. Both flights on time. These ancient 747s are showing their age even though both of these had been ""revamped"" they looked tired but clean.

They had an entirely empty first class section available, which they wouldn’t let us pay for or upgrade to for the flight. While speaking with customer service they were equally unhelpful.

And I’m told I can’t get my money back? This isn’t a regular circumstance. We are dealing with a global pandemic. But again. Nobody matters more than the almighty dollar. Nothing matters more than keeping those pockets lined does it? And people wonder why nobody has any faith in American consumerism. This is why. Because the only thing that matters is money. I will never do business with your institution again. . At the end of the day, you guys can keep your measly $500. Add that to the money you’ll get when you receive your bailout money from the government. You know, the money you “need” because we’re facing a global crisis. Imagine that.

I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all.

I have read many reviews recently of BA falling behind the competition so my expectations were low - but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience. Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work. I should have given my 'BA Golden Ticket' to one of them but forgot. However no matter how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby. The seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere. Not a nice start. The aircraft was very very old - a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum. The IFE didn't work properly. Amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality. The toilets (compared to AA) were small unpleasant. Seat is not up to most Business class standard. Food was awful and the 'club kitchen' almost non-existent.

I've also added up the money I save by the cheaper ticket, and with all the other hidden charges it would have been cheaper to fly with a better airline. Yes, they are a budget airline, but there are some things which shouldn't cost money, such as good service. When our plane was boarding, the staff were just talking to each other and a huge amount of people were confused and not even sure what was happening.

I was intending to print my outward boarding pass at home, but the email never arrived, so I had to use the digital version on my phone (which means one has to ensure that the battery is charged). The only error that I knew of, was that on the return flight from Rome to London, they first put the wrong gate number on the board for my flight, so it created some confusion. In fact, the gate shown for my flight, was for a different flight to London, which was delayed by 2 hours, and had originally been scheduled to depart before mine. The error did not affect me, because I did not go to queue up straight away, and I only made my way to the correct gate once I could see that the gates for both flights, the delayed one as well as mine, were on the board. All staff were fine, no complaints. I bought a bag to fit the size as per the measurements stated by Ryanair, to store under the seat in front of me, (""Members"" Holdall 40x25x20 cm. sold by Rymans), and travelled light.

I tried my special meal (acknowledge!) and all the other three menu dishes announced. All were absolutely substandard and not edible and I am not difficult and usually eat the dogs leftovers. But this was horrible and hazardous. Food in economy was edible and better than business. There was a cheese plate that helped me to avoid to starve. No ice creams and no inspirational additionals. Rate 6/10 Dubai-Bangkok was a great experience - as good as it gets on an airplane. A380 must be the king of the skies. Likely of my best flight ever, despite I had not slept the night before. I doubt that a general 1st class experience can beat this luxurious bz-class experience by Emirates on the A380. Simply outstanding on seat “hut”, meals, drinks. The onboard Sky Bar is a solid social effort and gimmick that is impressive and hard to dislike. I like the outer seats in the 1-2-1 biz-configuration with lots of space and great window access. The sports car design works well for me and the WiFi is solid and a bonus. Special meal was sophisticated and made to perfection.

An hour on the phone in the hotel lobby (mostly on hold) with Southwest Concierge, and finally they tell me they had a problem getting the payment that was successfully charged to my credit card in March to the hotel.
No attempt to contact me. No attempt to fix it and find me another hotel.

We figured it might be an adventure in traveling, that was worth saving the couple thousand dollars we would have spent on a mainstream airline. The only trick was I wasn't able to book a one way ticket on their website, so booked it though Kiwi.com. No complaints about Kiwi.com - everything went according to plan. Seats are not assigned in advance, nor could you check in online, but we arrived early and so check-in was easy, the people were pleasant and our seats were assigned together.

As a whole a very negative experience for a first time flyer with Ryanair which I sincerely hope never to repeat in the future. My advise to any prospective traveller is to pay extra and fly with a professional outfit.",1.0,Ryanair
176,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Perth.  A new plane, nicely decorated and kitted out. The seats had a decent width and pitch and  the IFE and onboard connectivity are always good. Unfortunately, the cushion and blanket are small, tatty and hardly comforting or warm. There was no drinks service until after the main meal was served. The selection of beverages was lacking and the quality of drinks seemed cheap. It was, however, the meal service that really stood out as a real disappointment.  On this route we were to 'enjoy' two hot meals. I have included photos as I don't think I could adequately describe how bad these meals were in words alone. The best part of the whole meal service was looking around the cabin and seeing the faces of fellow passengers do the big unveil on their hot meals. Priceless! Luckily Emirates do provide cheese and crackers and chocolate to partly make up for the rest of the meal. The crew service was professional and generally friendly, but I feel like the crew are trying so hard to get the service right that they fail to engage with passengers. They appear unnatural and don't let their personalities shine through. The flight boarded quickly, took off on time and landed into Perth only a few minutes behind schedule. The journey was comfortable and pleasant enough although let down by a haphazard soft product and poor food offering.",3.0,Emirates
177,"✅ Trip Verified | I miss the pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines. I have flown with them on a regular basis for decades and am disappointed at how bad the first flight I took with them since the pandemic was. My flight was purchased from Air Canada and AC is the first marketing carrier as per US DOT rules. AC is also the most significant carrier. I have clearly researched my baggage allocation prior to the trip and packed appropriately. Unfortunately, the SIA check in staff were clearly unaware of their own company's baggage policy (see pictures below) and refused to allow me to check my three bags. I had to repack my bags at the airport, which is both embarrassing and a complete hassle. I have never had to do this in my decades of leisure and business travel. I will definitely think twice before taking a flight with SIA again in the future.",1.0,Singapore Airlines

Far too many people crowded into a hot upper deck , with a long walk to the toilets , very noisy and far from the experience we expected .
The flight from Dubai to Prague had us enduring children running up from economy , and several middle eastern families decided they and all their children would upgrade themselves , unbelievable !
The return flight from Paris to Dubai was characterised by meals being served at bizarre times , and it was as if the staff just wanted to get it over with .
As we had left Paris at a reasonable time , we were offered breakfast at 3.30 in the morning , and lunch at 8.30 am Paris time .

181,"London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai flying with Emirates in economy class. There was a long line at check in at LHR Terminal 3. Security was smooth, though. There are a range of big brand duty-free shops at T3 so that was a bonus. Then boarding came. In my personal opinion, Emirates should have extra boarding time for bigger planes like the A380s as the long line resulted in a delay of 1 hour. After boarding, I checked out our seats. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg-room. The IFE System was clearly bigger and better than the last time we flew with Emirates. The flight was smooth as usual with EK and the meal was very delicious with now more bigger portions. We safely landed at Dubai International Airport at Terminal 3. It was very hard, though to find out where flight connections were as two signs led to different places. The shops at Dubai were even better with more choices of retail. Soon after the short wait we boarded the Boeing 777-300ER from Dubai to Dhaka, in Bangladesh. The seating was mostly the same but had smaller IFE Systems like old Emirates and the touchscreen response was poorly. They managed to maintain the plane cleanliness quite well. The food was more than shocking on this one. Nevertheless we had another smooth flight to Dhaka. On both flights the cabin crew were outstanding and were kind and polite. At Dhaka our baggage took at least two hours to come even though in the domestic terminal we had another flight with a different airline 2 and a half hours after landing.

183,"✅ Trip Verified |  From start to finish everything with the process has been shocking. ‘Low fares made simple’ understatement of the century. Our flight prices were not low and nothing was at all simple. £209 + £82 then a further £40 totalling £331. Few pointers, as I’m not the only one this has happened to in the past week. When people are purchasing what they think is a cabin bag make it much more clear that it’s not. In the circumstances people have purchased a check in bag and gotten through to security with these bags still in tow actually have staff at the airport to help. I paid for bags to be on hold and had to pay again for the bags to be taken from us upon boarding and to go on hold. This second charge should have never happened somebody should have taken these cases and put them in hold like I had paid for. The flight going and coming back we’re both delayed, pure lack of organisation is the only explanation. Upon landing back in the UK being stuck on the plane as there’s no buses to take passengers to the airport. Surely this is something that should be pre organised? Crew members were rude both going and coming, rude to each other, rude to passengers, sat in the back of the plane on their phones. Hardly professional is it? When trying to get help via a live chat to have the chat ended and not be listened to. Again rude and unprofessional.

I missed my flight that was at 9 coz I was late for 5min even though I did my boarding at6:30 and was late coz of the weight issues and the stupidity of the employees they made me pay extra which i dont mind if they treated me right and not each employee said a different thing than the other and made me late so when i got to the gate they already have taken my bag of the plane! First time I hear such thing could happen how did they do that just for being late for 5min and without even calling my name or searching for me knowing I did my boarding and then yelking at me and being so rude and not helpful at all and I had to pay 100 pounds to rebook for the next day only to get back on an old dirty plane with no screens and bad service for 5 hours and the most shock was that a women entered the plane before it took off by  5min!!!!!

186,"✅ Trip Verified |  I've been flying to Bombay for the last seven years to teach there. For most of those seven years I have flown Jet, but decided to try BA this time. Terminal 5 Heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the gate. Boarding was disappointing because there was no discipline in how the aircraft was boarded. Logic suggests you board from the back of the aircraft but when I questioned one of the staff, I was told they had stopped doing this over two years ago.  The flight was smooth, the seat significantly more comfortable than Jet's, the food good, and the service great. The steward who looked after my area was both friendly and authoritative. IN economy class, I can only book my seat 24 hours before takeoff. I can book the seat of my choice earlier if I wish to pay, and that was what I wanted to do with my Avios points, but you cannot.  I was told that several Executive Club members and Avios point collectors had made the same complaint, and that BA might consider allowing its customers to reserve seats with Avios points.

The IFE is rather dated but the selection was rich. Cabin interior was cosy and comfortable despite the age of the aircraft, making itself rather distinguishable from their sister budget air Scoot. The most memorable part was the food, which is a portion rather worthy of premium economy or even business class of other airlines. Return to Singapore an A330 looked newer and IFE was touch-screen. Cabin crew quickly served drinks and snacks after take-off, as there was slight delay on the ground. Separately they served the meal, and again they did not disappoint. Topped it off with a Hagen-Das ice-cream. The price was reasonably good as I booked early.

196,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is my tenth flight with Ryanair this year - and eight of the 10 flights had delays - usually between one and two hours, but we had more than three hours too! There is basically no way anymore that you can convincingly plan longer trips with them, for example a train journey after arrival, because you never know when you arrive. Today, we are loosing another train ticket that we bought ages ago in advance, when we still believed that some delays are exceptions to the rule, rather than the new rule. Even back then, we already calculated with a one and a half hour Ryanair delay, but that is just not good enough for that ""never on time airline"". To make things worse, according to EU law, they only have to pay compensation from a three hour delay, i.e. most delays go without any sanction, meaning a contribution from Ryanair for the additional expenses their customer have to pay. Long live neoliberalism? Add to that the non-existing Ryanair customer-sevice, which leaves you in the dark about new departure time, gate changes etc, and you have the worst package you can possibly buy. What can we customers do about it? At first, let us please stop buying drinks, food and other items on flights that come with more than half an hour delay.

Generally, a very friendly service, although I felt that the cabin crew on the MAN-SIN leg were a bit less so. I wondered if this might be due to travel fatigue after laying over from IAH on the fourth of four sectors. In-flight catering was my big issue with SQ on this trip. The flight time from MAN-SIN-MAN is longer due to the war in Ukraine and Russian airspace being closed - I reckon at least two hours more. I was a bit frustrated that the two meals were on opposite ends of that 14 hours. The lack of a printed menu (due to Covid - which I couldn’t understand as these have always been printed and distributed fresh anyway) meant that half way through the first 14 hours I actually paid for a bit of internet access, so I could see what refreshments were on offer (it was supposed to be free to do this, but I couldn’t work it out - although in hindsight, I should have just asked!). I was so hungry - the meals, refreshment and alcohol servings were just way too small. Entertainment is great, and the upgrade IFE since I last flew SQ a while back was nice. Seating in Economy is good (always nice to have three of four legs with a free seat next to me), although one the A380 the seat angle was very far back - some people like that, I didn’t.

Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up.

These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. It was good to be back!",3.0,British Airways
216,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Phuket via Singapore. We took 4 flights (2 each way) and all flights were late to take off, ranging from 30 min to 1hr 55 min. hile waiting almost 2 hours for the first flight from Sydney the staff looked to be very stressed and there seemed to be little effective organisation. Once we took off the flight was uneventful and the staff were friendly and efficient. The Boeing 787 was a new plane with good legroom for economy. I did not eat any food so can't comment. The next flight (also late) was an A 320, much older and more uncomfortable.Two more delayed flights in the reverse on the way back. 10kg of carry one luggage was a good amount. It was weighed at each stop so don't think you can go over the limit without penalty. We arrived at the stated gate on our boarding pass gate 82 and found a staff member who had been sent there to redirect passengers to gate 15. I couldn't help but think that this is a very risky way to advise passengers and how easy it would be to miss your flight if that person did not find you! The next and huge problem was that the arrival time printed on our e ticket and announced by the captain was incorrect by 1 hour. Daylight saving had commenced the week before.Therefore our arranged pickup as per our ticket arrival time was 1 hour earlier. I messaged the company from the tarmac as we were arriving in the hope that they were able to wait and luckily they had gone to the other terminal and then returned. We drove away and then had to return again for another family who also had been given the incorrect arrival time. I have no confidence in the organisational power of this airline. The captain was following the incorrect information he had. I would not recommend as 4/4 late flights caused us a lot of angst and we could have missed the connecting flights had they not been hours apart.It was also the middle of the night with no where to rest with children.",2.0,Scoot
217,"Not Verified |  Singapore to Sydney. I think Singapore Airlines is overall a very good airline but I think their premium economy compared to Qantas is ordinary. No curtain separating cabins, no welcome drink, meals out of aluminium containers. The only difference to economy is better seats. Not worth the extra money and not special.",2.0,Singapore Airlines
218,"✅ Trip Verified | The service provided by the cabin crew was fantastic. At check-in Ryanair makes money by separating you from your family and loved ones. There was no room at all to pay for the seat so me and my family could sit together. I got 5D my mum got 1C and my dad got 17C so we were quite separated from each other. The cabin crew said ""When everyone is seated we will see where we can put all 3 of you to sit together"". Before push back a cabin crew member collected me and said go to row 2 and sit on the E seat, my dad was waiting for me. After all, my mum was siting in 1C me and my dad were sitting in Row 2 at D and E. It was really pleasing to sit in one of the front rows. One of the cabin crew was full of energy she was the best stewardess I have ever experienced travelling with! The landing was really rough as it was windy in Dublin. The captain warned us before take-off that we will have quite a rough landing due to strong winds. I was eating chicken sandwich and a Nutella-Go, the Chicken sandwich was one of the best budget airline offered food that I have eaten. We all had a good time travelling with Ryanair. Because we wre travelling in the second row on the right hand side we had a lot of leg room and I could stretch out without any problems. It was a pleasing flight with Ryanair.",4.0,Ryanair
219,"✅ Trip Verified |  Porto to Milan. Today the day started with a delay in my flight without previous notice. Not an email, not a text message, I was only informed about it when I was in front of the gate to embark. The delay was of 2 hours which is not refundable but got me into a lot of trouble. I only had one bus to go to from the airport of my arrival to my destination and that bus was scheduled for 1:30h after a normal arrival. Since the flight arrived around 2:30h late, I missed the bus. I couldn't get the bus ticket refunded (20€ to waste) and I had to stay in the airport for 10 hours waiting for the next bus as I was traveling alone and leaving the airport with heavy luggage is not comfortable at all. I was trying to write to Ryanair to at least get some discount on my next flight since the delay was on them but I can't even get in touch with them because they have it in the system that the delay was under 3hrs so by European law it is all okay.",2.0,Ryanair
220,March 30th 2014. Hartford Ct. to Las Vegas. While waiting to board the flight I noticed a very angry looking male flight attendant wandering around the gate area he was on our flight and his mood didn't improve for the entire 5.5 hour flight. During a short period of relatively smooth air the crew started taking drink orders. Fortunately on the way home the crew were very pleasant with passengers. The plane was a 737-700 fairly comfortable and the free snacks were a nice surprise.,5.0,Southwest Airlines
221,"✅ Trip Verified | Definitely not recommended, especially for business class. The seats are ridiculous and small, the food is mediocre if that, and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight. The service however has been great. My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. Your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months. Never again unless there is no other choice. By the way, the business class lounge south at Heathrow is a cattle pen.",1.0,British Airways
222,"✅ Trip Verified | When I first flew Scoot a few years ago, the ""premium"" class was called Scoot Biz although it was really just a premium economy product. It was an excellent alternative to flying normal economy class being good value, good service with the comfort of a smaller cabin, bigger seats and priority check-in etc. The premium cabin has been renamed Scoot Plus some time ago but product remained the same. However, things appear to have changed. The cabin on this flight was dirty, the crew disinterested, the ""one"" complimentary drink served with the meal can no longer be a choice including wine/beer as you can only buy this as apparently the policy has changed and only water, soft drink, tea or coffee can be chose. I was informed I could only buy a wine when the Scoot Cafe opens. The meals were served immediately the flight reached cruising altitude and were being collected before I had even started. The lights were dimmed during the meal service and the crew disappeared. Other passengers started ringing the bell to order from the Scoot Cafe as it seems no trolley was going to appear. I thought selling food and drinks was the way to make money on these budget airlines! The crew freely allowed passengers from the back of the plane to use the one and only lavatory in the front of the premium cabin. I paid a lot of money for this flight for me, my wife and daughter (being the end of the school holidays in Australia) and was extremely disappointed in the standard of pretty much everything on this and another recent Scoot flight.",1.0,Scoot
223,"For the most part, Singapore Airlines are pretty good to travel with.

However, they are not very good at being challenged. On my most recent trip from India and before the first leg of the flight from India began, we were checking in as a family. The young man that was looking after us advised me that there was another family that had requested to be seated together in the row where my chosen seat was. I refused this and it was left at that.

Imagine my surprise when I got to the boarding gate in Singapore Changi airport, my seat has been reassigned without notification as I have turned notifications on to receive any updates regarding the reservation. I still had the boarding pass that was issued to me (the one with the original seat that I picked) at the start of the journey.

I had to be seated elsewhere throughout the entire 7 hour flight and not enjoy it.

When we got home, I filed a complaint a few days later and the response was anything but respectful. I was told that one of the passengers in my group requested us to be seated together, which is completely false. I can clearly remember what the young man said about this. He said there was another family that requested to be seated together. I'm going to say that they did not handle the whole complaint very well and were condescending when I called them out on this.

See the confusion and the lying? In the end, I did not receive any compensation for what I have been through and not even a sincere apology from management.

Overall though, the airline itself offers a good flying experience.",2.0,Singapore Airlines

After 1 hour, they said the flight was closed and did not make any attempt to let us board.

So three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hours. The food is awful, poor quality and with poor selection of wines - cheap Spanish wine with no choice, the cabin was over heated.

228,"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to London Heathrow. A bit of a mixed bag. Boarding at Miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time, albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back! So much for safety. Seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at Heathrow. Also my wife’s IFE failed mid flight. Impossible to hear information from the flight deck. These ageing 747’s really are in desperate need of replacement. The congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable, the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable. The minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired.

I was booked on flight EK433, with scheduled departure on Friday at 9.35am but was notified last minute via text message at 4.23am that I had been put on EK353 departing at 10.10am instead. To make things worse, that flight was delayed for another 1 hour 10 minutes. I didn’t know if I was traveling with Emirates or a budget airline that cancels flights on a whim. By the time I arrived in Dubai, my original 2 hour connection time had become less than 40 minutes. Ground staff in Dubai did not offer any form of assistance in making my connecting flight. I made it to the departure gate 5 minutes before closing time only to be told I had been offloaded from the plane. At no stage was I notified that I would be bumped from my connecting flight because of shorter than “minimum connection time” thanks to Emirates’ brilliant incompetence in punctuality. After some argument with the ground staff at the gate, I managed to get onto the flight with the supervisor granting me an act of grace, when it’s Emirates which had sinned. But his grace did not extend to my checked in baggage however, which will only arrive with the next flight. Arrangement to make delivery of my delayed baggage was made immediately after clearing immigration on arrival in Rome FCO airport Friday at 6.40pm, when I was assured my luggage would arrive following day. I even received an email saying my bag will arrive in Rome at about 12.40pm on Saturday. Little did I know I would be slapped in my face with Emirates’ commitment to punctuality again. When I haven’t received my bag at 5pm, I rang the baggage office, and was advised it had just cleared customs and would be delivered in the evening. 6 hours later I was still waiting, and followed up with another less than pleasant phone call. Upon which, the only solution they could offer is the contact number of the local baggage delivery agent. No, of course their gilded fingers can’t possibly dial the number to follow up on a customer’s delayed baggage. I finally received my bag on Sunday at 12.15am. Hooray for a change of clothes finally.

So, we paid the €120 just to get home after have a bad time as it was. That was on till we arrived at the plain and we were pulled from the line by another staff member that told us we hadn’t got priority boarding we would need to pay because we had forgot to leave our 10k baggage at check in to be put in the hold. I also explained what had happened to this staff member and asked her why the staff member at the ticket desk didn’t explain to us that we would need to leave our bags there AND YES, SHE DID SEE OUR BAGS, and guess what she said the exact same thing as the girl at check-in. its like a script you give to them, so they don’t have to deal with people who are been scammed by RYANAIR, so we had to pay another €120.

265,"On 9/30/24 I was buying a ticket for my mom to come with me on a trip. After I purchased the ticket, I realized I had inadvertantly gotten a duplicate ticket for myself. My mistake, I really don't know how I missed putting in her details. I cancelled that ticket and was immediately going to buy her ticket , so I just did a flight credit. I put in her information and everything was going well until I tried to pay. I could not use the flight credit to pay for her ticket because the flight credit was in my name!! I saw that the credit was transferable, so we made her an account, transferred the credit and bought her ticket. On Oct 2nd we cancelled the ticket. As it was past the 24 hours for free cancelation and a refund she got a flight credit to transfer back to me since I paid for the ticket. She was unable to do this because you can only transfer one time. As a new user with Southwest I was unaware that when you get a flight credit you can only use it for a flight in your name. I thought that I would have a credit to use however I needed as it is my money. Then when we cancelled the flight and she was issued a credit I fully expected that I could have it transferred back to me. I'm sure that there are others who hadn't read the one time rule either. So, I find that Southwest doesn't care if they cheat you out of your own money!! First by issuing you flight credit that you can't use as you wish. It's my money, I should be able to purchase a ticket for anyone I want. Second by only allowing a one time credit transfer. I realize that it was my mistake in the first place not putting the ticket in her name, but it was a mistake. Southwest had the opportunity to rectify this when I called and when I filed a complaint. I didn't ask for a refund, I simply wanted the flight credit back in my name. So for an honest mistake, I have lost over $711. Had I purchased the first ticket in her name, when she cancelled and got a flight credit, she would've been able to transfer it to me no issues, as that would've been the one and only transfer. For those who would say have my mom give me $711 and she has a flight credit to use. She cannot afford that, which is why I was buying her ticket in the first place. It would hurt Southwest in no way, shape or form to simply return the flight credit back to me. They still get the $711 revenue. The paper trail is there. They can clearly see the mistake of the duplicate ticket and they obviously know how their 'rules' twist this mistake all around to cheat me out of $711. I will never fly Southwest again!!

Their ability to brush off all customer concerns and ""pass off"" customers to avoid problems overshadows the prices for flights. They are cheap for a reason. Consistently stuck on planes waiting for passengers on one flight, and on the next they turn multiple people away. They state they do hard paperwork for the pilot before each flight, which must be untrue if they pilot comes walking on 5 minutes before departure. Another example of an airline that overbooks passengers. When asked about the status of my luggage, I was informed of a new ""system"" to check luggage. The employee stated she could not see where my luggage went due to the new system. This is a joke Southwest.

During the flight, my husband fell asleep and I put my earbuds in and started drawing. He slept with a neck pillow and his face mask would catch on the pillow and slightly fall lower than his nose. The flight attendant woke him up a couple times and asked him to pull it back up. He apologized and went back to sleep. As far me, I went into my purse to grab 2 mints and a protein bar. I pulled my face mask down to put the mint in my mouth. The flight attendant snapped and told me to put my mask back on, I said I was eating. She said, “it’s only a mint and if this is going to be an issue, I’ll call the supervisor!” And stormed off. We land and get off the plane only to be greeted by the cops. The cops questioned us on what happened on the flight. The cop told us that face to face conflict/confrontation was reported from the flight attendant and that’s why they were called. The supervisor looked up our return flight and revoked them. All over sleeping and eating a mint. The flight attendant might have had a bad day but it’s not enough justification to go out of your way to wreck our trip. Her behavior is unacceptable. I understand you want to keep everyone safe.

280,"✅ Trip Verified |  I embarked on a journey with high hopes and anticipation, having secured a connecting flight ticket from Penang to Singapore, and then onwards to Jakarta. Opting for Singapore Airlines, renowned for its outstanding reputation in both air travel and service, I anticipated nothing less than a seamless experience. The cost of this connecting flight amounted to MYR 1601, roughly USD 335, a price I was more than willing to pay for quality service. My journey commenced with a minor delay in takeoff from Penang. The flight proceeded smoothly, accompanied by a light snack comprising a slice of pizza and a beverage of choice. As we approached Changi Airport, the situation took an unexpected turn. The captain announced a delay in landing, estimating an additional 15 to 20 minutes before touchdown. A sense of unease crept over me as my connecting flight departure time loomed closer. Despite my concerns, I remained optimistic, trusting in the efficiency of Singapore Airlines to navigate any challenges seamlessly. Upon landing at 12:05 pm and disembarking at 12:18 pm, I was met with a startling realization. Rather than a smooth transition to my connecting flight, I was handed a new ticket, rescheduled for departure at 4:10 pm, accompanied by a SGD 15 food voucher for Burger King and Coffee Bean.  I sought clarity from the attendant, only to be met with dismissiveness. The absence of any acknowledgment or attempt at redress left me deeply disappointed. The disregard for my time and the indifferent handling of the situation underscored a gap in the airline's commitment to customer service.

We hadn't received NZ arrival cards, which are rather long to fill out, so I asked a passing steward. He seemed surprised by the request and I pointed out that everyone else would need one too. So a few minutes later he came round with some - but nowhere near enough for everyone so he had to go back and get some more. Then they got grumpy with us for having a tray table down (to fill it out) while we were in descent.

From the outset when we boarded they seemed to lack interest were detached and somewhat edgy. I noted the male attendant was unnecessary rude to two male passengers when he could have been much more polite in both verbal exchanges that I overheard.,4.0,Southwest Airlines
300,"Seoul Incheon to Singapore via Taipei. Scoot flight was fairly uncomfortable for me both to and fro. The seats were stiff and uncomfortable, there were no meals provided for 8 hour flights, they had to be purchased separately. The flight back from Korea was delayed for 2 hours, everyone who had to detour in Taipei was stuck for 2 hours and this was in the midnight 1-3am. I felt very sorry for a little girl who was extremely tired but since we arrived late from the Korea flight there were no seats left at the waiting area in Taipei so she had to sleep on the ground with her bag under her head. Both times I boarded the flight, both arrived late. No compensation was offered and the pilot claimed it was due to Taipei's runway being closed. Personally, I did not feel that the announcement sounded apologetic, it seemed more like an excuse to me. Afterall, the flight was already an hour late upon arrival in Taipei so clearly whatever the runway issues were the late arrival had nothing to do with it. A more comprehensive view of all the problems with my trip with Scoot. It was booked by my company therefore I was not given the choice to pick. When I checked the itinerary the first thing that alerted me was no 25kg check-in baggage. My boss' secretary booked it and when I asked she mentioned she did not know it was not provided because she assumed that all international flights would include it. Therefore, we had to pay for the baggage which eventually summed up to cost even more than Vietnam Airlines which already included the baggage fees (I did a price comparison on my own). I was sent on a two week business trip which required me to ship a laboratory equipment back. Another problem cropped up when I was supposed to ship the parcel back. I was paged by one of the airline personnel to the boarding gate. She informed me that the parcel has been detained because it does not fit the airline regulations. Firstly, like all the other normal, regular people, I do not read all the airline regulations although I have a rough understanding of what is allowed and what isn't. This knowledge obviously does not comprise of laboratory equipment and other aspects which are uncommon to be brought on board - if there was a problem they should have alerted me during the check-in of my bag, not when I am about to board a plane. The staff then told me I have to leave the equipment behind. She was pretty rude, trying to shove her piece of airline regulation in my face telling me that the specifications for the equipment exceeds those of the airline regulations. I am not Korean and the manufacturer's description were in Korean. I told her to open it and read it herself and I have no problem with that. She told me they already did and I just cannot check this in. She did not give me any solutions to my dilemma. What I got from her was basically, ""Miss, the airline does not allow us to take this on board, so please just dump it here and get on your flight."" I was obviously very annoyed by this as I had paid for the excess baggage. So I told her if the baggage is now left behind, I should at least be refunded for my baggage fees. She gave me a downright no. There was no effort being put into trying to make the customer happy. She didn't even offer to ask. All in all, no more Scoot for me.",1.0,Scoot

311,"Extremely Disappointing Experience with Ryanair Luggage Policy

I am writing to express my profound frustration and disappointment with my recent experience flying with Ryanair. Despite complying with the airline’s stated baggage policies and adhering to the specified size requirements for cabin luggage, I was unfairly forced to pay an additional fee for my bag at the gate. This experience has left me thoroughly dissatisfied, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts in the hope that Ryanair will reconsider its practices.

I had carefully checked the Ryanair website to ensure my hand luggage was within the airline's size limits. According to the guidelines, my bag met the required dimensions for carry-on baggage, which should have been acceptable to bring on board. However, when I approached the gate, I was informed that I had to pay an extra charge for my luggage, even though it clearly fit within the allowed size. This was incredibly frustrating, as there seemed to be no valid reason for the additional charge, and I felt completely caught off guard.

When I asked for clarification, the staff provided no coherent explanation for why my bag was deemed “too large” despite it meeting the requirements. I was essentially left with no choice but to pay the additional fee or miss my flight. It felt like a scam designed to extract more money from passengers without any genuine need, and I could not help but feel that the airline was deliberately taking advantage of its customers.

This situation was not only inconvenient, but also incredibly stressful, as I had to scramble to find additional funds at the gate to pay for something that should not have been an issue in the first place. The lack of transparency in how Ryanair handles its baggage rules is a serious concern. It is clear that there is no consistency in enforcing the rules, and this leaves passengers vulnerable to unexpected and unfair charges.

Furthermore, the way this issue was handled by Ryanair staff was utterly disappointing. The personnel at the gate were neither helpful nor empathetic. Rather than offering solutions or demonstrating a willingness to understand my situation, they were dismissive and seemed uninterested in resolving the issue in a fair and professional manner.

Ryanair's baggage policies and customer service are in dire need of improvement. It is unacceptable to charge customers extra money for adhering to the published guidelines, and the lack of clear communication only adds to the frustration. Based on this experience, I will be reconsidering whether I want to fly with Ryanair again and will certainly think twice before recommending the airline to others.",1.0,Ryanair

Nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew, providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight. Inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point BA needs to improve. Also check in via BA-app didn't work both ways, so again there's room for improvement. Would still recommend especially on this route because of the short check-in times and short walkways at Rotterdam and London City. Price can be high though, especially when you have checked luggage, but we hadn't and I booked well in advance. Paid 200 euros rtn for two, which was fine.

316,"✅ Trip Verified |  Strasbourg to Stansted. We were unlucky to have an aborted take off due to possible bird-strike and the plane returned to stand. The pilot kept the passengers and cabin crew well informed when on the ground, even connecting the APU to keep us comfortable. It was decided that we should disembark with all hand luggage whilst an engineer was called to inspect the engine, and for any damage to be repaired and then signed off. This did take some time, and passengers were required to wait in the gate departure area until the Police des Frontières had given permission for us (as a 'departed' international flight) to move into a larger area where there was a café. 5 € vouchers were issued and the café coped well with an additional and unexpected 189 passengers who were on the ground for over 3 hours. The only frustrating part of our time in Strasbourg was the time delay in getting the permission from the Police des Frontières and the lack of information ... not the fault of Ryanair, or the airport, which is an outstation without official Ryanair base representation only efficient and pleasant subcontractors. Ultimately engineers arrived and inspected the engine. The aircraft was signed off as safe to fly and we re-boarded with the same crew. The flight back was safe, uneventful and everyone was glad to be home. It is very easy to knock Ryanair for various aspects of their terms and conditions, but when it comes to safety they are second to none, and the responsible action by the flight deck, even though it involved a wait, shows what really matters in safe travel these days. And no, even with 'bird scaring' patrols, there is no guarantee that the little blighters will not come back to the same spot once the vehicle has gone.

323,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a trip from London to Muscat and then Muscat to Dubai for a week before returning to the UK. Emirates left us stranded in Muscat Airport. They had cancelled the flight and not even notified us of this cancellation. They had just put us on another flight 40 hours later without telling us. We turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist. There was no help desk at the airport, their App was down and we couldn't get through to customer service in Oman or the UAE. We tried calling customer service in the UK, and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later. Bearing in mind, we were having to use our UK mobiles abroad. We had another British couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing. I am over six months pregnant and this was meant to be a honeymoon for us because our original wedding and honeymoon were cancelled due to COVID. In the end we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there weren't any flights to the UAE for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when I was six months pregnant. We tried to complain in Dubai & we were told they couldn't do anything, we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the UK. I lodged a complaint & we have just received the below response, which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to FlyDubai. Firstly, they are part of the same group and secondly, we booked our tickets through Emirates & they took full payment for the whole itinerary. Therefore, we are their customer & we are nothing to do with FlyDubai. They offered us a measly 10,000 miles each, which costs them nothing & is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago. You need a min. 50-100K to upgrade. Emirates response: Thank for your correspondence and naturally, I regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport. I do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused, especially as I understand that you are pregnant. If I may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines. Although there is a partnership, Emirates and FlyDubai are two separate companies and Emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa. In this instance, the schedule change occurred to your flight from Muscat operated by FlyDubai; whilst I am not aware why their proposed flight EK2033 on 5 November was removed from their schedules in advance of travel, I would like to explain that unfortunately, there are rare occasions when these cannot be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. That being said, I note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of Emirates, as well as our partner FlyDubai. Whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline, I would suggest you contact your private travel insurers, as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations. Nevertheless, as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion, I have credited 10,000 goodwill miles to both your Skywards accounts.

I've flown on Emirates 777 in economy many times which is probably the best but on the A380 it's another level. My son and I sat in the back row of 4 seats in the front section, the flight wasn't full so we had all 4 seats to ourselves, a bonus. However the seats are wider with more leg room than on 777. The ICE entertainment system is excellent with over 100 movies for a 7 hour flight and the screen is big. The headphones are ok but I recommend taking your own to block out all noise. The service was excellent, maybe because it wasn't a full flight, and the food was good and they were quick with the drinks and made several drinks run throughout the flight. The next leg to Delhi was a 777 so I prebooked the 2 seats together at the back of the plane but when we went to the gate to board we were upgraded to business class, probably because the flight was full or overbooked but another welcome bonus.

342,"✅ Trip Verified | My recent return flights Singapore to Rome on Singapore Airlines were the worst airline experience I've had in my 50 years of international travel and I paid a premium for it. I booked my flights thinking I would treat myself to a quality experience and also paid over SGD50 to reserve my preferred seats. A longwinded online check in which didn't allow me to select carry on only. I needed the airport check in counter to sort that out. Then I noticed I'm not in my reserved seat, instead I have been seated in one of the worst seats in the plane, opposite the toilets. The flight was late, service was chaotic and I was constantly disturbed by the toilet use. I contacted customer service after the flight. ‘Operational/technical reasons’ were the excuse for my seat change (no change of plane type); no they wouldn't refund the seat reservation fee (they are reviewing but no word for 5 weeks). Also the reserved seat on my return flight was also unavailable (to me) and no, no refund, they would try to find a similar seat. I was passed around a series of CSRs, all of whom were brusque, intransigent and unhelpful. For my return flight, online check in would not let me register my Kris Flyer account because someone at SA had altered my name details. This took over an hour to sort out. In the end I missed the flight because I mistook 12pm for midnight. I contacted SA and was offered a seat on the next flight for SGD1400 'as a courtesy'. Even upset I said no to that. I booked with Gulf Air for SGD700, but I noticed in my searches the flight the CSR had offered, available online for SGD1000. The worst customer service and flight experience I have ever had from an airline that markets itself as offering a premium experience. By all means use SA if it's the cheapest deal, you'll get the same experience as anywhere else. I wouldn't pay a premium to fly with them because you won't get anything for your money. The airline knows how to market itself and maybe at one time, its service was above standard, but no longer. Reviews reveal that quality has tumbled post Covid. Clearly the bean counters have taken over as the airline tries to recoup its losses. In my recent experience, SA has been the rudest, most unhelpful and grudging airline I have ever dealt with and I will be avoiding them in future.",1.0,Singapore Airlines

345,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai. Due to bad weather in Europe our plane was late departing and we spent over two hours on the runway. Consequently we missed our connecting flight in Dubai. When we finally reached Dubai there was complete chaos. There were 200+ other people who also missed connections and it was not clear where to go. We followed the crowd to the desk area for help there were only 4 Emirates staff helping over 200 people get to their final destinations. We were trying to get to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania to meet a further connecting flight to start a 5 night safari. After after about a 45 minute wait we eventually got to speak to someone who said we could get an 8 hour flight to Johannesburg then a further flight to back to Dar Es Salaam. This would mean we would have got to Dar Es Salaam too late to catch our final connection and would have missed two days of our safari. Out of a 5 night safari this is a significant portion. When I complained I was told to stop wasting his time. Other people were also being badly treated. One other passenger found a replacement flight online and asked to be transferred but was told you've got your ticket don't speak to me anymore. Bearing in mind Emirates knew early on that the plane would be delayed they had over 8 hours to sort this out what they came up with was completely inadequate. It seemed everyone was being sent to Johannesburg. As the flight to Johannesburg was 4am the next morning we were sent to a hotel to wait. When we got to the hotel there were hundreds of other people waiting to check in as well. We queued in reception for over 3 hours to get our room but I'm not sure why we bothered as we had no luggage as this was still at the airport. Thankfully our tour operator Audley Travel managed to book us onto a flight to Zanzibar and then onto Dar Es Salaam in time to meet our final connection and only miss 1 day of our holiday and not 2. The flight to Zanzibar was with FlyDubai which is owned by the same people as Emirates. Why couldn't we have been offered this option by Emirates? You would hope this was the end of our bad experience with Emirates but no. When we went to come home we turned up at the airport in Dar Es Salaam over 3 hours before our flight was due to leave but were told by the check in staff that they could not print our boarding passes. The reason for this is because our tickets were out of sequence. It seems you have have to go wherever Emirates wish to send you in this case Johannesburg regardless of wether you wish to go there or not. We spent a further three hours at the airport in Dar Es Salaam not knowing if we would be able to go home. They said it was a security issue but they could clearly see our passports, they could see when we arrived in Tanzania as our visa was stamped with the date of arrival and they would have known our luggage had been transferred to a different flight. Only thanks to the persistence of the check in manager at Dar Es Salaam who spent over 2 hours on the phone and the immigration officials who sped us through security did we make the flight back home with only 2 minutes to spare. All in all I would definitely not recommend Emirates as an airline. It seems they can only run an airline if things run smoothly but are completely out of there depth if they hit a problem. The mark if a good company is how they deal with things when problems arise and in my view they completely failed",1.0,Emirates
346,"Unimpressed, particularly with food.  I recommended this Airline to two of my friends as the previous flight I had with British, (mind you some years earlier), had been most impressive.  However, on this occasion the flight to Singapore had staff who seemed totally disinterested and when we asked for a light snack, were shortly told there was nothing!  Our return journey back to Sydney provided us with more friendly staff however a glossed over apology was offered for the flight being 2 hours late.  The food was dreadful and, as my friend put it, they give prisoners better food. British have just lost 3 future potential customers.

347,We flew from LHR - Singapore - Brisbane - Cairns then the same return journey. In general the service was good and we all enjoyed the food very much. There was a problem on the route from Singapore to Brisbane in that our seats were in the centre block and for some reason the crew kept missing us first we got no food (they ran out just as they got to us then started serving people around us but not us) and in spite of several attempts to get their attention they ignored us. Eventually my husband had to go down and ask them for food. The stewardess was very apologetic. I also noticed that when seatbelt checks were done on that flight they didn't actually look along our row. I witnessed a couple of people pressing the Call button and getting no response at least for quite a while. On the same flight the entertainment monitors were unreliable. Mine didn't have sound for a while and my son's just stopped working. The other legs of our journey were quite good and I was impressed that our luggage reached our final destination efficiently. I did find the legroom a bit cramped but that was more to do with the pillows and blankets. The main problem on the final leg of our return journey was a child a couple of rows behind us that just cried incessantly for almost 16 hours. Being a night flight we'd hoped to sleep most of the way but the whole section of the plane around the child was kept awake. There seemed to be no bassinets on our flight so no doubt the child had to try to get comfortable sitting on parents lap? The crew were no doubt also affected by the crying but what can anyone do in such a situation?,4.0,Singapore Airlines
348,"✅ Trip Verified | I and my husband are 71 years old, flying regularly twice a year for many years and this flight was our worst flying experience ever! This flight was 6 hours long and we purchased the tickets with Emirates based on their advertising and did not mind paying almost double price than all the other companies charge. We wanted on this pretty long flight more comfort, wider seats, more legroom, good food and overall better experience as Emirates advertise. The outbound flight was with Emirates partner company FLy Dubai, Boeing 737Max not Airbus 380 as they advertise. Nothing of the advertisement was true. The airplane had regular narrow seats and little legroom and there was no complimentary drinks and food at all. This is almost criminal! Yes, you could buy drinks and food but why you pay almost double price to fly with this company? Their advertisement is fraudulent. On this journey we also flew from Abu Dhabi to Muscat with Oman Air. The flight was only 60 min. long and complimentary drinks and luncheon was served. Than we flew from Muscat back to Dubai with Swiss Air. On this only 50 min. long flight complimentary water and snack was served. The inbound flight with Emirates was not bad, Airbus 380, little wider seats and little more legroom, complimentary drinks and food. Nothing really great but OK.

They cannot find any new date with as low additional costs as possible and want from me to define exact day. When I did it, I had to wait one week and they agreed but expected high additional payment. They want much more money for making a change in dates (it is possible in the already bought reservation) than it was paid. They want even more than for new tickets. Cancelation is possible with a refund equal to 10% of the initial price. You were my favorite airlines, now I am going to use other companies what will be cheaper than making the change in SA. I am disappointed as you cannot solve a relatively easy issue: 1) change dates in the reservation of my wife without super extra additional costs, 2) sell me a new ticket for the same outbound flight as for my wife, 3) add an infant to the reservation of my wife.

352,"Although we flew to Malaga with easyJet we returned with Ryanair as the flight time was more convenient and the cost was slightly less, especially as it was in euros, although I declined Ryanair's ""kind"" offer of their guaranteed exchange rate.

Apart from that possible catch in the booking process, everything else about our Ryanair experience was fine. Boarding was efficiently handled and even a difficulty with our boarding passes - the barcodes could not be read - caused no comment. The cabin crew did sterling work managing to stow everyone's cabin bags in overhead lockers, even telling passengers whose bags had to be located away from their seats where exactly their bags were to be found. There certainly seems to be a more customer-friendly approach from Ryanair these days and we are less apprehensive about being caught out in some minor, but expensive, infringement. Though it's still wise to read all the small print before flying, we are now quite ready to choose Ryanair if flight times and prices suit us.

There was no such requirement on booking the tickets via BA's website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage. The requirement is not even on the front page of the embassy's website but well hidden under drop down menus. Usually when there are requirements like for ESTA for entry into US, BA sends a prompt. However, there was nothing in this case. BA had on its system that I (the other parent) had travelled BA already reach Johannesburg a day before. The BA counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. Instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets. After being given the wrong email address first, when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations, they refused to refund the ticket cost, only refunded taxes 25% of total. The overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off-putting. They said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of GBP 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking.

360,"✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the recently introduced second flight. Priority boarding after business class allows time to settle in, with ample space in the overhead lockers. Just three rows in the cabin, with good legroom and comfortable seats, which have a decent recline. There is a footrest on the seat in front, and a calf rest attached to the seat, which seems to serve no purpose other than create problems for the crew in trying to them stowed for landing. Good sized TV screen which is easy to operate. Overall the hard product is good. However there is nothing premium about the service, which is strictly economy. There are no pre take-off drinks, and there was no bar service after take-off prior to the meal. This may have been due to the late hours departure and a wish to serve the meal as quickly as possible, but one would have thought that with a maximum of 24 in premium economy this would not have been a big issue. Amenity kits are no longer handed out, but the menu indicated they were available on request. Meals were tasty, but the same as economy, served on plastic trays. No sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website. Drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses, and in small quantities. Wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled. Fruit juice slightly larger serving, but still meagre. No offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy. Service starts with premium, but then proceeds through economy, with clearing starting at the back of economy, so that premium economy is the last to be cleared. With the time difference the second meal was lunch. This time I ordered champagne, served in a plastic stemmed “glass” amounting to half a normal glass, again no refills offered until trays cleared, at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly. The main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort, on which there are no complaints. However notwithstanding the fact that Singapore economy is amongst the best, it is not a premium economy service. Having chosen to pay a significant premium over economy, it is disappointing that the enhancements provided by other airlines are not provided.",4.0,Singapore Airlines

364,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Kansai. Due to the fact that I was in a tour group, I couldn’t choose the airline I was flying. I wanted to fly Thai Airways, however that wasn’t possible. On a timeline scale, I reserved an extra ticket for my Mum in business, as it was on sale at the time. It was only $200 on the first sector, so we brought it. It would also benefit me and my brother by having an empty middle seat. Initially, I asked for an exit row, and got the best seat, 4J and 4H. However, the boarding passes they printed us were the flimsy receipt type. Once I got on board, the flight attendant at the door greets you,  and find out that there is someone occupying my seat. I call the purser, and she is unwilling to help and throws the responsibility at ground staff. They then say that this was a double seat assignment and that I had to sit in row 15. The seat itself isn’t appealing, and some short haul aircraft have better seats. I could’ve paid extra for seats with extra legroom, but since it was a group booking this had to be done at check in, and inevitably led to the double seat assignment. Luckily, the scheduled aircraft to fly this flight was a 2 month old 787. But the plane looked like it had suffered years of abuse! The most annoying thing also mentioned in previous reviews are the call button/light switch, awkwardly placed on the armrest. I understand the 787 doesn’t have call buttons on the ceiling, but can’t you find a better place for it? After takeoff, I order a lasagne and pasta for my brother. The lasagne tasted unappetising, while the pasta tasted really bland. A little bit later in the flight, I had Ice cream for dessert and also nachos prior to landing. All this food set me back 50 Singaporean dollars. The equivalent amount of food on AirAsia would only cost me a third as much, and also tastes better.  On the flight from Tokyo to Bangkok, the staff at the check in were friendly like Japanese people are, and I requested an extra legroom seat, and found out I wouldn’t be charged for it since the flight was overbooked. However, my brother wasn’t allowed to sit there, so we asked if he was allowed to sit in The “ScootInSilence” zone, which he wasn’t allowed to, even though he was 13 and the minimum age to sit there is 12. There was a lady and her daughter talking in Japanese in the counter next to us, and later in the flight, I saw her and her daughter (who looked like she was 10) sit in the scoot in silence zone which made me question if I had a language barrier, even though the guy at the counter wasn’t Japanese. The crew on this flight were much more friendly, but still considerably cold. I went to have some conversation in the galley, and after 2 minutes of pleasant conversation they all had their backs turned on me.

The Boeing 777 seats are at a 15 degree angle so your legs can not be flat. This flight seemed understaffed. Too few bathrooms which were tiny and not always clean.

The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations.

If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee.

Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!!

388,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight.

394,"✅ Verified Review |  Toulouse to London Heathrow. This airline will one day get its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier (it has to be said, no expense is spared on its branding) while operating as a cheap and sleazy budget airline, thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management. I have Bronze status with BA Executive Club, have flown a dozen times over the past year (both in Business and in Economy) and am increasingly irritated with myself that I chose to collect points with this particular airline. I was caught up in the IT meltdown in May (flying from Rhodes to London), and I was one of the lucky ones (who doesn't remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days?). I had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from Rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled (along with hundreds of other BA flights in May); this (incidentally: ghastly TUI) replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight I booked that I lost my pre-paid hotel booking at the airport, which the airline refused to refund when I lodged a claim. The airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight, along with EU compensation, after I sent a second email a month after my first claim, as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me, according to the customer agent. Their customer service is beyond atrocious. I suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for BA failings (all you get is ""bear with us, we're trying really hard""), lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability. I am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to Belfast, and after two calls to their contact center (based in India, with a poor connection and amateur communication overall) still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a Canadian citizen without a UK ID document. The customer agents I spoke to gave me contradictory answers, which, in turn, run contrary to the (almost non-existent) information provided on their website. On the flights I have booked which have actually taken place, I have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in BDX when the plane lost its takeoff spot, having waited for delayed passengers (would they admit this was their fault? Nope, it was all air traffic control's fault!), been held on the tarmac in TLS for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane, retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk from my Club seat (no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it), sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently used as confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in Club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival.

So I submitted a complaint, and simply asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn't make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&amp;C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&amp;C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there's no way out! and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! so They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back. (The funny thing, that when you see their ads and the way they sell their services doesn't reflect any reality, so don't believe those ads you see, as it doesn't reflects the whole picture, there is a hidden dark side) So to summarize the story, don't feel smart when you find a very attractive ticket by emirates as you might end up paying more to go home, plus you will have some disturbing moments when you try to solve this issue with them.

This was partly my fault as I was over the baggage allowance, although this had never been a problem with other airlines. The explanation was that SQ is strict with their baggage allowances - fair enough. However the amount of time it took was unacceptable. This resulted in having to rush through passport control and the TRS and left me with about 15- 20 minutes to quickly eat something before having to board the 4pm flight.

417,East Midlands to Faro and return. Have flown many times with Ryanair both on business and for leisure. Only ever had one serious delay. Both flights were ok. Return flight delayed by 10 minutes with limited catering due to knock on effect of strike in France. Staff apologised for this with clear explanation as to reason. Staff on both flights very pleasant. British Airways should teach their business class stewards to give a genuine smile like this. With regards to complaints about add on charges. Read their terms before you book. Everything is made clear on their website. A bonus with Ryanair is no reclining seats. Why do you need to recline your seat on short haul restricting leg room for those behind you.,4.0,Ryanair
418,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Hong Kong. The flight experience wowed me. This was only the second week that Scoot was taking over this route (previously,it was operated by Tiger Air A320), and I was highly anticipating my journey, especially given the aircraft, a Boeing 787. This inflight experience was on par of that of full-service carriers (with the obvious expection of IFE, food that is included in the ticket price and the like), I found the seats to be really comfortable and the window shade was innovative, what with the feature to dim the windows to suit your comfort level. I ordered an item from the duty-free catalogue before take off and I received it quickly. Although being a budget carrier means that it has no free food or drinks, the service level was not compromised-on par with its parent airline, Singapore Airlines. If you are expecting the seat pitch to be on a level with other budget airlines, then get ready for a surprise-the seat pitch was as good as some full-service carriers! Although I would recommend anyone taking Scoot (as with any budget airline) to bring your own entertainment on board- but overall, the flight experience was on par with that of other carriers and they landed in Hong Kong 15 minutes ahead of scheduled! Was an amazing flight, given the low fares and the good service, I would definitely take this airline again. However, one complaint that I do have is with the armrests - the attendant call button and the overhead lights button were on the armrests, so you could accidentally press them really easily and I had to take extra care to not push them.",5.0,Scoot

We booked lounge access and Scoot in silence as a treat to cap off our 5 week holiday. We find that our flight was not on the screen so go to the service desk. The lady says that the flight is still on and to head to the appropriate gate. As we were walking away we are called back to be told that the Scoot flight has been cancelled and Scoot has tendered a Singapore Airlines plane but there would be no refreshments or entertainment offered. On top of that we lost our lounge access and Scoot in silence. About a week after we got home I find out that there has been fraudulent activity carried out with my credit card in India, one of our stops around the world. I had to get a new card. I then started the process to get my money refunded from Scoot and that has continued to this day (5 months later). They will not accept my new card details which has been provided in the form of an official letter from my bank. They are thieves and will not accept that they have stuffed us around no end. I will never fly with them again.",2.0,Scoot
422,"✅ Trip Verified | First, we boarded the plane late due to a maintenance issue. Then, we sat on the tarmac for an hour before the crew announced they couldn’t fix the issue so we’d have to exit the plane, luggage and all. We were told to just wait for an update. The plane didn’t leave until 5 hours after the original departure date. Due to the delay we missed our connecting flight. Southwest booked us for an evening flight, forcing us to stay another 5 hours in another airport terminal. (They wouldn’t put us on an earlier flight.) We are arriving so late that we are missing our last train home and will have to book a hotel. In sum, we were supposed to arrive at our destination at 11.30am, and will now be arriving at 10pm. Next time, I will pay extra money for a more reliable airline, because the 10.5 hours wasted and hotel add up to more than what a pricier ticket would have been.",1.0,Southwest Airlines
423,Flight 2094 and 1672 for the return. 2nd-3rd April. Flew from Porto to Lisbon and back again. I was not expecting much given how little we paid for out tickets but was pleasantly surprised. Boarding at Lisbon was hectic and somewhat like an airport in Mumbai but that may just be the airport. Planes land passengers walk out and you board in all of twenty minutes. Fast and efficient. Flights were on time and pleasant overall. Seats comfortable and quite roomy accommodating my 6'2 frame easily but of course they don't recline.

Looks like this is the rule only from India. We were charged a very high price of 35,000 Rupees for just 2 personal items which was a backpack and handbag. We had no choice but to pay.

The connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant. The ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. Then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage.

426,✅ Trip Verified |  I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer. The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate. I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst. It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff. My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time.,1.0,British Airways

Due to a family emergency, I had to cancel the flight and request a travel credit in the original amount of $586 in 09/14. When I spoke to the Southwest Airlines Customer Service rep to ask what my options were for reusing the travel credit I was told that as long as I made my flight reservations before 6/6/15, I could reuse the travel credit. I asked if the new flight would have to be scheduled before 6/6/15, and she said no, as long as I made my reservation before 6/6/15 I could apply the travel credit to the new flight since I have to pay for the flights at the time of reservation. I'm now trying to book new flights on 6/16/15 and Southwest Airlines is refusing to accept my travel credit of $586 towards the new flights since they expire on 6/6/15.

The cabin crew walked past me three times without offering a drink although on each occasion she had a tray full of drinks. I did eventually get a drink but only after I specifically asked for one. A380 seats for me are uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Cabin crew service was poor and disjointed with the majority of business class crew spending more time in the bar area chatting, at times outnumbering the passengers there. The main meal was very good although the wine service was poor. Again, the chocolates mentioned in the menu were absent as was ant offer of coffee after the meal. In flight entertainment was good. This was the sixth flight on business class with Emirates within four months and each time I have been very disappointed with the product. Service on the A380 seems to be very poor.",3.0,Emirates

And again changed it back as I complained after boarding the aircraft. The interior of the aircraft looked old and not clean. The worst part was food. Chicken/prawn curry with rice. These were my options and I choose chicken curry.  Snack was a small pizza which was a joke. I was hungry for the whole duration of the flight.

The flight attendant who was in charge of the back was a man, a strong and big one. The space between Ryanair seats are tight and also the aisle is not a wide one. Thus it was very difficult for that flight attendant to move. I never forget how he (unintentionally) hit my head with his elbow when he was trying to move in the aisle serving drinks to passengers. To my surprise, he didn't even turn back to say sorry. He might not have realized that he ever hit me!

To add insult we paid for their most expensive flights to get good flight times to make the most of our Wedding holiday, as did 40+ of our guests too; and they put us onto their cheapest ‘night flights’ that are still selling online now dirt cheap. It’s 4.5 months on since they changed our online booking (no notification, we just found by fluke by logging in), but when we rang they said they cannot change the flight until it is confirmed then we will ‘receive an e-mail’ to be able to request a refund or accept the new flights. I call every month and e-mail every month but I get the same text book answer ‘you can change your flights when you receive your e-mail of the change, which could be up until 3 months prior to your flight date’ - So Ryanair's customer service answer is wait 6 months until all other flight prices are sky high so we can’t afford to request a refund and must accept our overly inflated cost of night flights, as we bought them under false pretenses.

On the return journey the scones, clotted cream and jam was acceptable but the rest of the 6 meals we had on the other 3 flights were horrible. Emirates beef and mash - meat was too large and overcooked to be edible, sauce saltier than sea water and a salad of sweetcorn. Emirates directly employed staff are great but third party ground handling staff are horrible. No customer service skills at all shown in Mumbai. They didn’t even offer a buggy for my child in a massive airport and then went on to charge me an extortionate amount for 17kg excess baggage. No hospitality in Dubai, forget a lounge, no information communication or water when delayed with a family. Their profit grabbing has lead to a simple burger and fries meal costing £20 for 1 person and a sub standard lounge at £180 at my expense!

SQ used to be my favourite for its crew consistency in service and courtesy. Sadly, I notice it declining every year the past five or so. Check-in at Perth by snobbish and cold DNata staff quite a difference from past experiences. Perth to SIN was not bad on the older 777-200, not completely full so had a spare seat between myself and the window passenger. Legroom was good on these older jets, with an older entertainment system, which I tend not to use that much. The food was fairly dire for economy and portion sizes terribly small compared to the past. Why is the choice always a bland beef or fish (even when labelled the 'Asian' dish)? Singapore is a nation with a rich culinary tradition, but the meals were invariably bland and uninteresting on all four flights. Choosing the Hindu non-veg meals on the return journey to was more a fraction more spice, but again miniscule portions. But worse was the robotic and occasionally sullen crew. Not once on the PER-SIN did I see the inflight supervisor smile the many times he was in economy class. Just haughty and stiff. Upon disembarking, he couldn't even raise a smile for the economy class passengers. Apart from two very junior staff (about 1-2 months on the job, I asked them), who were pleasant and helpful and actually bothered to make eye contact, the rest of the crew I saw in economy were none of that. Mainly robotic, courteous but practically no eye contact and a cold efficiency. TYO-SIN was a dreadful red-eye special at the rear of a packed Boeing 777-300ER. A noisier plane more claustrophobic feeling large jet I have not encountered down the back. It was unpleasant for a nearly 7 hours in darkness. The leg room is just passable. The entertainment system was the only saving grace for those who enjoy it late at night. Food again was ordinary and bland and small portions. Drink service was stingy. I became visibly ill during the flight and whilst crew members saw me using a sick back and using the toilets repeatedly, did not once ask if I needed anything. Mostly the crew sat down at the back around the galleys gossiping in the interval between meal services. They worked fairly hard during service, but there was no warmth for passengers. On both flights, the time taken to clear the meal trays is now long, nearly one and a half hours on both flights. Unconscionable on a past-midnight flight when the majority of passengers generally wish to sleep.  For the passenger who remembers their finer years, I will no longer give them preference when considering my options from PER to TYO. A really disappointing set of experiences.",3.0,Singapore Airlines

Customer service is non existent. However, of course if you call the ""new booking"" line someone immediately picks up of course, however they can't help me nor put me through to anyone apparently.

EK500 operating on the DXB-BOM sector had already occupied its gate (B20), even before we cleared our formalities. The flight, needless to say is big and the number of people waiting to get on board is a clear sign of that. The cabin crew on board were polite and never dropped their smile throughout the flight duration. The legspace gets in more inches than a B777 (that we used for BOM-DXB) and the windows seem more larger. The night time ambient lighting adds to the drama with all the buttons overhead at the touch of a remote. The in-flight entertainment provides all the details of the flight and the most amazing outdoor camera locations one can ask for during the flight. The food was pretty good, if not exceptional and we were more than happy with the fact that it was piping hot.

In other words, they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggage. Now you pay for food and even water. Two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink, effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight. How can they let a cost-cutting CEO with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline. It is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service - a shame to be called British.

They told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as I had only one carry one and nothing checked. I went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as I would have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket. So I had to wait another 3 hours. I have now been traveling for 18 hours. At the gate for boarding they looked at the bag and said I would have to check it. I explained that it is a regulation carry on bag and it was on the last two flight and I have had the same bag on over 30 flights as carry on. I explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and I have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as I will be getting in late. They were very rude and tagged the bag but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and get on the bus to the plane. I decided to carry it on to the plane. It fit easily in the overhead as it has for every other flight (there were other bags that were bigger than mine. They actually came on the plane and took the bag off and put in in the cargo hold.

How could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not, did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract. But nothing and when we tried to call their number in London this guy said he can’t help us with rebooking or a refund but he can put us through to them in Dubai. I hang on and on for 3 hours before realising this was a trick to just get rid of us. I got tired and hung up. There is no other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we can’t answer your call, when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers.

Business Class is way better on the A380-800, where you get a lot of privacy (specially in windows seats), great food and a great service. Business Class is good enough in the 777-300ER, but you don't get a lot of privacy and the seats are angled lie-flat, so not as comfortable. Emirates Economy Class, specially on board of the A380-800, is one of the best in the world. I have flown for years with Lufthansa in Economy Class, and Emirates beats it hands down. The PTV screens are huge, there is a good amount of space, the plane is really quiet, and the service is better than on Lufthansa. What I mostly liked about Economy Class, apart from the IFE is the fact that they don't bring your food in hot aluminium trays, but in hard plastic, that is much better looking.

So, Scootie, what's so difficult about keeping passengers updated in a timely way rather than having them turn up at the airport only to be informed by ground staff ...who by the way claim they have also been kept in the dark until the very last minute. You know what sucks more...the delay (1700 - 2235) was over dinner period...you'd expect that out of a bit of decency or concern, the least Scoot could have done was to offer some sustenance, some token snack and water.

In either case, it seems extremely unfair on people like myself who have paid full price out of our own pocket, since the service for so many passengers is obviously not as good and why should I have to pay three times as much as my neighbour for the same seat? To add insult to injury, Madrid and Barcelona are Emirates' most expensive business class departures cities in Europe.

After a while they realised that I needed to board and gave me no options other than paying 110 euro (2 people) at the counter. They suggested me to contact the customer care straight away and explain the issue.  I did so right after and sent an email through their website. They answered me after 10 days telling me that I should have done the check in online.I then contacted the customer care via the live chat and they were absolutely useless. They told me to call the call center and provided me with a number that work only if you are calling from Europe. Once I explained that I live in Australia they said they are sorry and that there was nothing they could do.",1.0,Ryanair
503,"✅ Trip Verified |  I'm motivated to write this critical review after multiple phone-hours with customer service agents with Emirates in the hope that others would benefit (and that Emirates would listen!). We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes. All I received were platitudes such as, 'we understand', 'that is awful', etc. over the phone but with no real help to process our claim. Lesson learned and no more Emirates for us ever!",1.0,Emirates

Had previously travelled in economy seats (standard blue) and actually found no difference in service or comfort. Waste of money paying the extra for Bizclass. The entertainment streaming was unavailable on our flight which made the 5 hour journey seem quite long and tiring. The return flight was delayed 4 hours which totally interfered with our plans and cost us dearly for additional airport drinks and long term parking. We were bussed along with all other passengers to the plane which was still being repaired when we boarded.,1.0,Scoot

Flight changes for our international flight now cost 5K and southwest says they are not responsible for flight delays and inability to get me to my destinations on time! I have never had such a negative overall experience during my travels that I had to take a moment just to air out the grievance at 4AM while still traveling.  A short hour flight became a 3-hour overall flight due to inclement weather and being re-routed to Grand Rapids Michigan. I understand that inclement weather cannot be controlled and safety is priority. One would assume as a purchaser of a connecting flight that when a portion of that flight is off schedule the airline will adjust as needed to still get the customer to their destination in a timely manner. I was not given any reasonable options as I was on my way to catch an international flight to Bali, Indonesia and had to be in LAX by 4AM, I was given a ticket to get into LAX at 9:30AM. Adjustments were made to get me flown to Seattle after waiting all night to get my bags in order to re-check them I was treated extremely poorly by the check-in bag personnel who was training another employee. She was very curt, abrasive, dry, and mean. When I brought it to her attention that I had been stuck awake in the airport all night and that I did not appreciate her demeanor she brushed it off and continued in a very aggressive energy to nitpick anything i said or did, such as placing both bags on the scale after the first one had been weighed. When I again emphasized the poor fashion in which she was treating me she said she ""refused to serve me any longer"" which to my knowledge is only acceptable in scenarios of disrespect and while i felt severely disrespected by her treatment of my person, I did not act in any disrespectful fashion toward her.

515,"✅ Verified Review |  Ponta Delgada to Lisbon. There are many factors that contribute to a satisfactory journey and unfortunately not all the expectancies were met for this flight. Let's start with the positive side and then see what was wrong and could be improved. The value for money was great, just 15 euros for a 2-hour-flight. I would never had booked this journey without getting a similar fare. It makes all the difference. Now it's time to see what could be improved. Ground handling: below the standards. The incoming flight was delayed, so they decided to start boarding when the plane arrived at the stand. That added more delay and resulted in a slot loss and in a 30-minute-delayed departure, that could problably had been partially avoided with a better coordination. The flight time was shorter than scheduled, so that we catched up the delay and we arrived just 5 minutes behind schedule. The onboard experience was good and being asked to move to a vacant seat in the emergency exit row gave some rest to my long legs. Awesome, isn't it? Negative score to the bar service: the food products we selected were unavailable and that was a pity. I don't mind having a snack or to dine on board instead of doing it at the airport, but with no guarantees about the products available, I'll start to consider the airport bars when flying with Ryanair. At least, I can find more options and make my own selection.",4.0,Ryanair
516,"I flew from Singapore to Melbourne, Australia on 25th May SQ 237. Firstly, the cabin attendant didn't help me find a spot for my small backpack and sleep apnea machine (in a small attache case). He simply stood there and told me to put it all under the seat in front of me. Well - there's no room is there? I found some spots to put my stuff amongst the grand pianos and freezers stored up there.
After take off, the lights were not turned back on. There was no service, no meals, no anything. I thought they served a supper? No - we had to wait until early morning Australian time to get a meal and that in itself was very disappointing.
During the long 7 hour flight overnight, crammed into a tigher space that ever I had no choice but to press the call button and request....well...something to eat and drink as I was quite famished and dehydrated to say the least. I got a coffee which was like water and I has to call them AGAIN to get some sugar and a toothpick size wooden stirrer! In the day, they would serve a coffee with a spoon and sugar on a little tray. Not Singapore Airlines. The staff in general were not friendly at all - and wearing a mask throughout the flight was a nuicence - however, the main problem for me is that I have a hearing loss and could not undertand ONE word of what they say. There was no written menu, covid or no covid they NEED to accomodate persons who are deaf.
Lastly, the old B77-300ER is getting a bit long in the tooth. The plane is OLD. When I took the mask off to drink a tiny cup of water (maybe a minute later) I was yelled at and gestured to PUT MY MASK BACK ON by the attendant. When I took off my mask to drink water, the AIR inside the aircraft smelled dank and moldy. Hence I caught a sinus and respiratory infection which required antibiotics.

It was a pretty long flight and I never felt bored, to be honest I wanted to spend a little more time on the A380. Later that day I had a connecting flight to Kolkata. I spent a bit of my time at the lounge which was splendid. I was 10 mins away from missing my flight because I almost forgot what time it was when I was at the lounge. The flight to Kolkata was a red eye and pretty tiring one, but I asked the flight attendant if she could serve me hot chocolate after I wake up.

My flight to Nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable IT system that BA have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs. The handling of the situation at Heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that BA encounter these days, they would have got this part of their act together. They make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue, when clearly they have not been investing where they should, instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses.

I then received an email at the time the flight was supposed to take off in Burbank that said I had not canceled the flight and that I would lose all my money because I had not canceled it before the time of departure.

However the seat space felt slightly cramped and the seats weren’t very comfy. I feel like the lower back support isn’t very good and this makes you sit in a position that is uncomfortable. I say this both for the A350 & A380. I am comparing this to my last journey with Singapore on an older 777-300ER, which in my opinion feels more spacious and the seats feel i lot less cramped. Also the lower back support is better. The meals, are okay by all means but when i compare this to Emirates or Qatar, they are very basic in the sense that all you get is a main dish, bread, crackers, cheese and a small desert of some kind. Nothing to shout about considering this is a top airline. The crew, outstanding on all flights I've been on, friendly and you can take your water bottle and keep filling it up. If you want a drink at any point you can go up and ask.  Transit, probably one of the easiest airports to transit through.

I have flown on many airlines and scoot by far has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had traveling in my entire life by all measures. Every experience with them has been frustrating and ridiculous. I have never encountered more unhelpful and incompetent people in my whole life than those who work at scoots call centers and airport transfer desks.  I tried to check my bag in online but the website links did not work, the app did not work, and it took 30 mins to get through to call center. The representative put me on hold after every question because it was clear he did not know how to answer basic questions. Finally, he informed me bag would have cost 400 Singapore dollars if I had checked it in at the airport counter! And this is insane considering how extremely difficult it was for me to check it in ahead of time with none of their websites or apps working properly.  I was wondering if they intentionally cause their website and app to not work properly so that customers who need to check a bag get trapped at the airport with a fee twice as much as the actual flight. I also tried to check in through Scoot’s app 3 hours before flight. To my panic, the app said that my flight had already departed which was entirely not true since it was 3 whole hours early! A kind of glitch like this is unacceptable on every level because of the panic that it would cause!!  The first of my two connecting flights were delayed 6 hours for “mechanical issues” and they did not even bother to notify me ahead of time. No email, no update on the app. The app said everything was on time! No one knew this under we got to the airport 6 hours early and had no options. Even when I had spoken to Scoot’s call agent to check my bag earlier, they did not mention this. I luckily found out through my travel agent, and since I was going to miss my connection, I had to make a new flight plan. Scoot was so unhelpful and incompetent that I was mind-blown. I wasted my entire last day of my trip on the phone with them which they ruined entirely! For absolutely no reason at all, they refused to simply put me on a different connecting flight that worked out with the delay time and had available seats. They said that I would have to just fly to my connecting airport and just take a risk and see what is available. When I finally got to my connecting airport, no one on my flight had any idea at all where to go or what to do, and the Scoot agents at the transfer counters were clueless. They sent me to the entirely wrong counters and kept giving me conflicting info about my checked bag.

Southwest is a point to point airline as I was told by customer service today, (after holding for 90 minutes) which means if a previous leg is delayed or canceled there is no plane to pick you up. So know where your plane is coming from and check its flight status. We were told another plane was being routed from Dallas to Nashville to pick up passengers and come to Orlando to be our plane from Orlando to Birmingham. The delay was again changed from 10:15 to 11:55 then to 12:55 am. A plane did arrive at 12:20 and we were told it was our flight. Only to be told at 12:50 am that the pilot has too many hours and cant fly you to Birmingham after all, so we are now at 12:50 am going to officially cancel the 9:20 pm Flight and we cant get you on another flight till 9:20 pm the next day. My concern in calling customer service was to ask that the process be reviewed in regard to how this flight delay then cancelation was handled as obviously a mistake was made in telling the passengers they had a plane coming with a delayed departure time set for 12:55 am and yet no one in command for Southwest was checking flight hours for the pilots to realize there was no way this flight was leaving Orlando. The customer service rep said she could only report my concerns to management but I did not have the right to ask for an explanation or any admission they had made an error in judgement on when the flight should have been canceled. I just wanted to know they would look into it and determine a better method to communicate flights, delays and pilot and crew travel restrictions so that this type of very avoidable error doesnt happen agsain. Southwest cannot control the weather and they will continue to be a point to point airline operation but get some people who can do math to determine flight hours limitations for pilots and crews in these situations so after a 4.5 hour delay you are not told the flight now has to cancel because of pilot has to many hours to fly. If you are making these types of errors what else is happening behind the scenes? Also I would just like an email from management that they are looking into this for enhancement or correction and wa stold no way your getting any admission from us about why this happened. Does not make me want to continue my long tenure with Southwest.",1.0,Southwest Airlines
550,SQ285 from SIN to AKL. Despite a full flight service was good. Flight steward were attended to fulfil my request very soon after the bell was pressed. But disappointed over the ageing aircraft.

551,"I flew twice with Southwest Airlines in 2012 and they are by far the best low cost airlines I've ever flown on. For the 4th of July celebration in America, I flew from Albuquerque to El Paso to celebrate the holiday with friends. The flight left on time, a quiet but comfortable flight and likewise with my return flight to Albuquerque.
In October of 2012, I flew from Albuquerque to San Francisco via Los Angeles. The flight crew were very friendly and overall was a pleasant flight. The stopover in Los Angeles was also quick, making the trip shorter than expected.
The flight back to Albuquerque stopped over in Las Vegas. There was a slight delay departing San Francisco (SFO) due to problems with passengers documents but the flight crew kept passengers onboard entertained, making jokes and talking about Las Vegas. The connection in Las Vegas was short as well as the flight to Albuquerque.
I think it's fantastic that Southwest offer complimentary drinks and snacks, as well as two free checked in bags, low cost airlines here in Australia would never offer this service. The flights are quite cheap, supply your own computer, iPad or iPod as a source of entertainment for longer flights and you are set for a great trip!",4.0,Southwest Airlines
552,I rebooked my flight because of family bereavement. My original booking was upgraded to business class from yellow coloured seat I booked earlier. I paid the penalty for my flight Gold Coast to Singapore. Less than 12 hours before my flight I realized that my seat allocation had gone. Not only the business class upgrade but also the yellow coloured seat. If I want to return to my original seat I have to pay again 14 Singapore dollars which I am not happy to do but no choice. What surprises me is that Scoot can give yellow coloured seat number 52 for free but not my original seat number 23. It just does not make sense to me. First I lost my seat allocation and upgrade to business class now Scoot asked me for SGD 14 at the last minute. I won't be flying Scoot again. It is useless to be a loyal Scoot flyer.,3.0,Scoot
553,"Nightmare Emirates flight from Dubai to London. We were on our 2nd leg of our journey from Sri Lanka to UK on 5th January. First the flight was delayed from 4.10 to 5.00. Then 45 mins into the flight we were informed by the Captain that there was a problem with the undercarriage and we would be turning back to Dubai. After dumping fuel and circling for a further 2 hrs in Dubai, we landed back in Dubai at 9.00pm. Then we had to wait in a queue with just 2 people at the counter to get docs to go to a Hotel. It was taking for ever. After collecting docs they were asked to go to yet another counter to leave the duty free items bought. It was utter chaos, children were crying, there were a lot of very tired passengers. Finally after a very long time and the Management woke up to the crisis, they offered food and the business lounge for some of the passengers, which we took up. I am totally shocked at the Emirates response to this incident. No regard to the passengers and what they had gone thru. They had over 3 hrs to organise the vouchers for the Hotels and transport for the passengers. Yet they kept passengers waiting longer with their laidback attitude. Will certainly be thinking twice before booking Emirates again!",2.0,Emirates
554,"✅ Verified Review |  Took a business class from Singapore to Athens return. We booked our flights pretty early, couple of months ago prior to the flight and booked our seats for the flight. Paid about SGD 2.2k per person. From Singapore to Athens, the quality of service and the standard of the service was way below par. The air stewardesses do not know what they were doing, some told us that we could have free flow water, some then told us that actually they do not serve water unless we purchase. Thereafter when it came to meal time, the stewardesses were clearly unsure of what was on the menu, i.e. we were offered the choices of pumpkin or turkey wrap, but actually, it was a pumpkin and turkey wrap. As it was an overnight flight, we were woken up 4 hours before the arrival for our meals, which was a little annoying for some of us whom have given them instructions that we didnt want our meals. From Athens to Singapore, during check in, we realised that our first row seats were given away to customers who did a 150euro upgrade. It was unprofessional of this airline as we booked our seats way in advance, paid much more for our business class seats, and the walk-in customers whom came by the counters, decided to pay for the upgrade with simply 150 euro, and yet they could take our seats which we have chosen beforehand. And we can all foresee, the counter staff, ground staff etc all said they cant do anything about it. We sent in a feedback to Scoot and as we can all expect it, there wasnt any response from them. We met another passenger who also told us that Scoot just cancelled his flight. Word of advice: If you really have to travel via business class seats, choose the first row as the rows 2 and 3 are not worth the heavy price tag. There wasn't any certainty and your seats can be given away to others.",1.0,Scoot

Because we had no extra time, we headed straight to security and didn’t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass (not of the passport holder). We got stuck in security because of that, couldn’t figure out what was wrong.

Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker. Overall Southwest offered outstanding service and comfort at a lower price than most other airlines that I have flown on. Southwest has given me an experience that I would gladly repeat many times.",5.0,Southwest Airlines

I'm sure they knew of the delay earlier, but somehow they missed informing the passengers. On the other hand Ryanair uses the satellite terminal in Athens, which is a bit far, however passengers walk to the aircraft and they can use both front and back doors to enter, so this is fast and easy.

564,Flew Singapore from Brisbane to Paris via Singapore and then return on the same path. Check in staff and flight attendants on all trips were very professional and helpful. Air con hardly worked between Brisbane and Singapore and was most uncomfortable. Also very disappointed (and annoyed) when offered peanuts as a snack despite telling the airline that I was anaphylactic to peanuts! After telling the flight attendant he was most apologetic and gave me and my family potato chips instead. Overall the meals were ok - especially good from Paris! Flew on the A380 between Singapore and Paris and there was plenty of room so were able to spread out and have a proper sleep!

565,"Gatwick to Mauritius via Dubai. Packed flights on the A380 there and back. Service seems to take ages. The food out of Gatwick was revolting but on other sectors was good especially the fish coming out of Mauritius. Found it odd that they serve food first and then come round with drinks as it means you've finished eating before you get a drink. The food needs to be hotter, mine was barely warm enough. The crew on the Boeing 777 coming back to LGW seemed more efficient and friendly than any of the A380 crews. The IFE is outstanding on Emirates, so much to choose from. The drawback for flying on Boeing 777 for me was having to be bussed to some remote stand at Dubai, it took ages to get to the plane. It seems that the A380's get the airbridges and the B777's have all been kicked out to the back of beyond. The low rating for WIFI is because I didn't use it.",4.0,Emirates

After maybe 45 mins they turn off the lights again and stop the service, good luck going back to sleep. Totally brainless behavior.
Aside from that, they sell premium seats with the promise of extended legroom - not true because there is a separation wall right in front of you so you can never stretch your legs - and of ""scoot in silence"", which is also a hoax as the cabin crew rush up and down the aisles at all times and random passengers who haven't booked that section and aren't aware of its purpose get assigned seats upon check-in, which again defies the purpose and the promise they charged extra for",2.0,Scoot

The meals on offer were basically Economy meals served on China instead of plastic. The flight attendant was not able to tell me what types of wine were available. She even tried to convince me that a Chablis is a red wine. Everything was served on one tray. All those service shortcomings were explained as ""hygienic precautions"". The seat is very wide, but it’s hard to find a comfy seating position, and padding was insufficient. What really made me upset was the all nigh chit-chatting of the staff in the pantry. I know it was a long empty night flight, but please do not rob me of my sleep. This was not the first time I’ve experienced this on SQ. Transfer in Changi was chaotic, with passengers of each connecting flight being herded in long lines (nobody cared about social distancing here) before being escorted to their next flight. I’ve been on a long haul Qatar Airways flight a couple of weeks ago, and there was no compromise in services, and the staff was disciplined as always during the night flight.

Service was fantastic as usual better than on the return leg since crew were still fresh from rest. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was so-so. Had a choice between braised beef with fried rice and fish with potatoes. I had fish while my companion had the beef. My fish dish was disappointing with not much taste to the fish. Vegetables tasted fine. Starter was a bit on the dry side. Dessert was heavenly. My companion said the beef tasted good. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured with a smile. They didn't seem to think of this as a chore. Cabin crew were helpful and joked with some passengers. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below.

Not the airlines fault and Captain continually updated us. In fact his best update was yet to come. Finally departed bit sooner than originally informed. Inflight service again professional and courteous. Yes, prices can be slightly high, but they are on trains too, but not too over priced, in my opinion. Certainly was no strong selling on this flight. Further delay as we approached Palma, this time due to the weather, but again superbly informed and updated by the pilot, who made sure to tell us we had enough fuel of course. Eventually arrived approximately 1 hour late, into a torrential downpour, thankfully to a stand and not a remote stand with bus trip. I was impressed with Ryanair and indeed the little comments and humour from the flight deck ensured that though we were delayed, not due to Ryanair actions, probably made the experience less stressful than it could have been, I have now become a fan and would use once again.",4.0,Ryanair

Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying.

583,"✅ Trip Verified | I must share my recent experience. I love flying Southwest, the employees are fun and accommodating, but this year which has been a tough year for the whole world and to top it off as an active military family we were recently put on orders to move out of state, making this year even more emotional and scary having to travel. Well while flying out of Ontario CA. On 11/28/2020 my husband, son and I were waiting to board and as usual Southwest has always treated military greatly so we wait for A listers and group A to board, usually small children and active duty is called next to board but we understand that doesn’t happen every time everywhere, well my husband approached the operations employee and kindly in a soft low tone asked do you allow military to board early here? Well a simple sorry sir no would of sufficed, but he just gave the most annoyed attitude tone and said “No we don’t, and you can go read online if you want” he didn’t even allow my husband to finish his sentence and he was extremely rude. Wait! You think that’s all oh no, we waited for our group and number to walk up and he looked at my husband and said “wait let me check that it really is your turn”, he didn’t want to let us on the plane until he made sure he verified all three of our tickets as if we were too incompetent to read the big letter and number on the boarding pass. I could feel and sense his anger and annoyed mood towards us with just his stare. I’m not one to give reviews much but this really bothered my heart and mind. A smile and a positive attitude can make a huge difference in a person but not bigger than a negative attitude and a frown. Flight 1258 out of Ontario, I will forever remember your rudeness and lack of care toward the military member “my husband” that has volunteered to serve so that your family doesn’t have to be drafted, so that all that freedom you have is possible and so that your personal family can feel safe.

On the DXB-AKL and DXB-GLA legs (GLA used because EDI not convenient; no extra cost), the economy product on the A380 was well worth it. Could do better: the B777 product is quite cramped by comparison (10-across, not recommended, but only on one shorter leg) and its IFE is tired, even before it is compared with the equivalent service on the A380. EK is working towards introducing A350s on the EDI sector and they can't come soon enough. Finally, the checkins at both EDI and AKL were very quick; opening ""early"" (four hours or so) does make life a lot easier.",4.0,Emirates

592,FR9823 I traveled from Bratislava to Rome back in April I must say we were satisfied with Ryanair the aircraft was modern and clean staff smiled and were helpful. We arrived on time we had our boarding passes ready we took our seats the flight was good no turbulence. Captain provided updates to passengers multiple times during our short flight. I don't understand previous complaints about printing boarding passes. This is their policy it is clearly stipulated on their web. they have good prices one just need to follow their terms and conditions. As a reward you will get cheap flight tickets very simple. Also you can have two cabin bags with you for free. Just be sure they fit the cabin bag dimensions. Italian crew checked all the passengers cabin bags this never happened to me in England or Slovakia.,4.0,Ryanair
593,"Not Verified |  Overall, my flight was great. We arrived just in time for boarding, and it was quick and fast. Taxing was surprisingly quick.  Entertainment was easy, you could bring your own handheld device. The website offered a ok selection of movies and tv shows, along with free messaging (iMessage and WhatsApp). Internet costs 8$, but free for A-List Preferred members I believe. Lastly, they had a good selection of Live TV stations and free Iheartradio. The seat width was good for a 2 hour flight, however one concern I would have is food. They only offer a snack mix on the airline, however they do offer a selection of beverages. If you are going on a longer flight, please bring your own food. The landing provided scenic views of the Hoover Dam, the touchdown was a little bumpy.

595,Currently on board the plane traveling from Chicago to San Diego using the wifi I purchased for a whopping $8.00. Aside from being able to access a few sites on my iPad (ironically this is one of them) the wifi enabled me to do virtually nothing. I could not open my Netflix/HBO app because they were incapable of connecting to the network so I tried their respective online websites to access my media. Once again the websites were unable to load due to the wifi and I found myself soon discovering more and more entertainment related websites/apps (games/music/etc.) were unable to load. Apparently their definition of wifi limits you to reading Wikipedia articles and twiddling your thumbs while you constantly refresh pages.

599,❎ Not Verified |  Madrid to London Heathrow on a busy Monday evening in November was an entirely mixed affair. Boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. Boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. This resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. Some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. Every single seat was occupied. This was quite hard on the staff. A trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain UK based TV personalities. This was in English only. The inflight service was very poor. I ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me. Disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage. I regard this as a health and safety matter. British Airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service.,3.0,British Airways
600,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the 23rd of December to Moscow. But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. As no one in",4.0,British Airways

We flew Southwest from San Francisco to Orlando and Washington DC to New York and were amazed at the quality of service. The check in system is easy and efficient. the staff keep you posted at the departure gate on how to line up and how many people are on the flight. The system of no reserved seats appears daunting but somehow it works really well. Once on the plane the cleanliness was surprisingly good, the legroom was amazing as I am 6'5 and my wife 6' and the friendliness of the staff was as good as we have ever seen.

603,Arrived from London with my fiance. We bought tickets from their website and purchased preferred seats for an extra hundred dollars only to end up sitting in completely different sections of the plane. Our advance purchase had not been logged into their booking system. Our problem isn't that we couldn't sit next to each other but the way in which we were treated by the Singapore Airlines staff. One particular male check in staff blatantly displayed annoyance at us and showed no signs that he was willing to rectify the issue. We gave in and just decided to sit in whatever was assigned to us and after a promise of a refund for the preferred seating we were dismissively waved off. Started off badly on the ground and continued in the air when we were bypassed during meal service and one rude staff wasn't interested when we questioned her. A senior crew noticed this and was professional in trying to make up for it but by then we were fed up at the inadequacy and total lack of customer service.,1.0,Singapore Airlines

605,"✅ Trip Verified | Overall an ok flight. Lounge - SilverKris Changi is huge and was too over crowded. We had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable. We only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes. Way too busy. Gate/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadn’t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast. Boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority. Seat - narrow. Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident. Also disappointed that when I booked this flight it was for the 777 which has better seats for sleep but that changed to the less than comfortable 350-900 medium haul.",3.0,Singapore Airlines

610,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Bangkok. Departure delayed by an hour due to a technical fault which could not be fixed with another Emirates A380 due to fly HKG non-stop to DXB three hours 25 minutes earlier. Some passengers from that flight were transferred to ours. But why that should have resulted in a lengthy delay to our flight beats me and was never explained. As a result we had to sit on board for over an hour before push-back. Once again I found the revised upper deck layout with 100 or so Y passengers in front of business class especially annoying, this time with what seemed like a major raucous party taking place just a few rows in front of my seat. Having travelled for much of the day and connected in HKG, I found it impossible to relax, the more so as the plane was being refuelled and the lighting full on. How come refuelling took place after the scheduled departure time given that our aircraft had arrived in HKG several hours earlier? Although hungry, I skipped dinner as midnight was just too late for me. All I wanted was try and sleep but even that was difficult with the short flight time. I appreciate that technical issues do occur and I felt sorry for those who had to be involuntarily rerouted via BKK and would as a result arrive late in DXB by six hours or more. For those of us who had elected to take the Bangkok flight, though, this was maddening! The lack of detailed explanations was even more so.",4.0,Emirates
611,EDI-BTS on 17 May. I've opted to avoid Ryanair for the last five years preferring to travel on full-service airlines from central airports for a little more money. However in this instance Ryanair offered the easiest best times connection from Edinburgh to Vienna (well Bratislava). I paid £8 for seat 1C (extra leg room and priority boarding) and £15 to check in a bag online the day before departure. Bag drop at Edinburgh was efficient. On time departure friendly staff quick flight early arrival can't complain. Apart from the lousy dry cheese sandwiches and drinks you get on Lufthansa/Austrian the difference was minimal.

612,SIN-FCO-SIN on SQ366/365. The crews on both flights were outstanding and accommodating to our requests. Nonetheless there was a handful of crew members who whilst polite were rather cold and didn't appear to be interested in going the extra mile. I've noticed this lately on SIA but this was made up by the exceptional service rendered by the rest of the crew. We ordered special meals. Food on the outbound was excellent though our vegetarian meal on the inbound was very bland and not fulfilling at all. IFE selection was mediocre at best. Movie and TV selection was limited and disappointing. This tends to be the case on SIA it's a bit of a hit and miss. Emirates has its act together much better in this area. We got a refurbished 772 which was nice. Legroom was great. However the hard seat cushions made sitting down a bit uncomfortable after a while and ill-placed IFE remotes which were on the armrests. Your legs would keep knocking against the controls. Overall it was an above average flight and I would use SQ again. Though I wouldn't be adamant. It wasn't spectacular and I'm sure they're competitors can offer equally good flights.,3.0,Singapore Airlines

However, I found a very cheap one way flight from Faro to London Stansted and couldn't resist. I paid for one large bag while checking in. We planned to take a second bag as a carry on. Check in was very easy although there are still quite a few extra things they give you the option of purchasing at the last minute which can be annoying. Got to the bag drop at Faro and was very surprised to be asked if we wanted to check the second bag in free of charge. Apparently they do this if the flight is not full. We sat near the back of the plane and had the three seats to ourselves. I really like the seat allocation as this has completely eliminated the mad rush that I remember. We didn't have anything to eat or drink as it was a short flight but we did buy our coach tickets from the FA and saved a few pounds. All staff encountered throughout were very friendly and helpful.

I was told I needed to check in my carry on along with my 2 checked bags. My 2 check-in bags were only 10kg each. He scared me saying, I will be charged $150 fee for my carry on bag since I have a laptop bag also. He reiterated only 1 piece of baggage can be carried on board on a A380. Very poor form and service. I didn't expect this from Emirates. I declined his offer and proceeded with my carry on and laptop bag. Nobody stopped me at the gate. Hundreds of other passengers had bigger and heavier bags. Perhaps he took me for a first time traveler but I know the rules and facts. Awful customer service.",2.0,Emirates
634,"Not Verified |  Chicago to Hyderabad via Dubai. My wife and I bought business class tickets from the airline directly. After getting the boarding pass we wanted to go their lounge. We were informed that we are not allowed to use the lounge as we had a different category of business class ticket, I have traveled in business class on many airlines and this is the first time we have been denied lounge privileges. Buying a ticket on sale means we get the same Privileges for lesser money. We felt like we were economy class passenger. We are determined never to travel Emirates again.",2.0,Emirates

07 Jul 2019    12:25PM  on the 7 july on a scoot flight singapore to cebu the last hour of the flight my family was asked to move away from the exit seats in which i asked why when there was so many vacant seats on the plane available, we didnt know their seating policy regarding upgrade to seat on some seats near middle exit, we actually asked why. The flight attendant spoke to us rudely about the said policy, we understood so we moved back to our original seats. We thought after we moved it's all good, but the flight attendant continues to provoke us instead of leaving us alone. The attendant need re training, on managing conflicts instead of creating one so she can use her power to threaten passengers they will be reported etc. This flight attendant working performance is poor and it need to be reviewed. As i said, we told her to go away and leave us alone but she still continues to harass us, no one should be treated that regardless of what airline 'Scoot we will never fly with you again because of that flight attendant. To everyone, please take note on our review or you may have the same fate we had Scoot.",1.0,Scoot
636,"Traveling with a family through Southwest Airlines was terrible because we did not know of the free seating rule, even though our tickets said we had assigned seats. When I asked the attendant about this issue she was rude to me and my family. On our way back we flew through Southwest Airlines as well and were delayed (without explination) we had to spend the night in Chicago, paid for out of pocket! They tried to help us get a hotel but they booked us one in the wrong airport and almost made us pay for two hotel rooms. When we returned back to the Midway airport our next flight was also delayed making us late for work the next day.",1.0,Southwest Airlines
637,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Sydney via Singapore. Currently sitting at Changi  with practically zero information on our overnight flight that was due to depart at midnight. We were advised very late of a 6 hour delay, flight not scheduled to depart until 0600. Surely the airline knew about such a significant delay before now. My Scoot flight was also delayed coming over here from Sydney for 2 hours, seems standard for their service so keep in mind there is a good chance you will get “stuffed around” if you fly with this airline. Knowing the absolute barebones approach, shoddy customer service and what it seems consistent delays, this will likely be my last flight with Scoot. I would be careful booking with such an inconsistent service if at all, best avoid in fact, pay the extra $50 and fly with an airline who is organised and punctual.",2.0,Scoot
638,"Not Verified |  You really take a chance getting to Nashville Airport especially with the crazy traffic. I was flying out of Nashville on Southwest Airline. I live 2 hours away. You could at any time be in a traffic jam for 2 hours. I was lucky arrived 4 1/2 hours early. So I stood in line for 1/2 hour to check in. Oh no, you can't check in. You are too early. Apparently you can't check in with Southwest Airlines more than 3 hours early. Who knew. So I went and sat for another hour and watched people. Very interesting. It's better than being late. Boarding the plane, my seating pass was in the B section. I usually go toward the rear but every seat I wanted was being saved by the passenger next to it. So I had to actually turn around along with other passengers behind me so I could find a seat. Did not know that you are allowed to save seats on Southwest. The stewardess just shrugged her shoulders and asked people to back up. What a mess. What is the point of paying an extra $15 to get to board early.",4.0,Southwest Airlines
639,"✅ Verified Review |  Zürich to Singapore in March 2013. As I do my booking pretty early I'm often able to reserve a seat in the wing area. So that's 40+. Therefore I board the plane late to avoid queuing. To my surprise all three seats were free and it remained like this. As I ordered previously my special meal online, I got it before actual service starts. This time a tenderloin absolutely tasty. Cabin crew as usual very aware, they're able to read your wishes from the eyes. Even a small talk is possible.",5.0,Singapore Airlines
640,"Crap, crap, crap!!! We had a wonderful holiday in Singapore. Scoot was the only part of our holiday that we regret. I'll spare you the details, but the 5 hour delay (...BOTH WAYS ) we had (...which our travel agent didn't even know about) was not the end of it; the bad stomach upset we both had on our return following our meal on the flight sums up our experience pretty well. If you're contemplating a trip to Singapore with Scoot ... DONT DO IT!! This is without s doubt the worst airline (... budget or otherwise) we have ever experienced. CRAP!!",1.0,Scoot
641,"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to London return – business to London and First back to Toronto all on Avios. Fast check in at Pearson with the usual friendly check in team. Fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. BA (presumably to save money) have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – Premium Plaza. Its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled high. Elevator music drove us mad, and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft - (what on earth are you thinking BA?) Fast boarding, though with fewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmented. Late with Champagne, wash bag after take off etc. With only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. The new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. We were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin, had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. All choices were available but the food is just not club standard. Poor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. BA really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to New York have to last for?? Got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. Returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new First check in, fast track and Concorde lounge. Excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. Some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. Dry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and scones. Early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after landing). These were my first mixed fleet Biz and first class service experiences. The crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smart. However, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. Long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights. Flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms, and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped, but BA really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers.",4.0,British Airways
642,Inflight entertainment selection is poor…and meals are poor compared to other airlines. The leather seats are hard and uncomfortable. The amenities bag is rubbish - no socks and no eye mask.,2.0,Singapore Airlines
